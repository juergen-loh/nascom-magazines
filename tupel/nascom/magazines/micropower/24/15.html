Latter day ROMs work off 5 valts and take relatively little
jurce from bus lines, particularly ae they have standby modes
then not enabled. So, out mth the hacksaw ang dawn to work.
</p>
<p>
The first job is to remove the switches from the Monitor
board and you will also need to remake the links to pin 20
(Output Enable) on the tue sockets that are plugged through into
the Nascom&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p>
Next you need to cut the tracks to pin 19 and 21 of the
other pair of sockets. These tarry the *17 ang -5 volts needed
by 27085 but nat by 2716s nor bigger ROMS.
</p>
<p>
The 2708 sockets provide all the data bus lines and address
lines AG ta AD. To aceonadate a 2/16, you need ta find AU and
connect 1 to pin 1% 8/2732 needs All and that has to go to pin.
18, and the BoSIC ROM need= AL! on pin Zt. Check with) a data
sheet, or any of the many articles on the subject more competent
</p>
<p>
than ihis one, ae ta what toda with the pins that are now
floating, but you can is prartice pack up Alb, A11 and A12 from
anyuhere on the Nascom I- Suggested plares in increasing Order
Gf castety are the Z80 CPU Socket (pins 40, f and 2), the
Nascom&nbsp;1 00x 42 way connector (pins 1, 1% and 9) and lastly the
Nas/Gemini /d0-hus connectors on the bulfered. matherhoard (pins
3u,41 aod 42), These are also in increasing order of length, 20
</p>
<p>
2 final decision must be made ss 2 compromise between physical
god electrical properties
</p>
<p>
The last part of the modification depends on the KAM board
that is fitted to the system and produces the correct enable
Lines for Ene ROMS, I une the Nascom RAM B Card which has the
Nascom&nbsp;1 connection on the bant-select. sochet. Sixteen
dpen-collector outputs are used ta choose which part of each
bank of KAM is mapped to which 4k memory area. The simplest,
solution. and the one that I tried first, was ta connect pin 20
fof the BASIC ROM to the E and F qutputs of the bant-select. No
Swgery $s required since there is a convenient hole where the
Siiteh was talen out of the based.
</p>
<p>
5p. the Ni select goes to ploch 0. the Joh of RAM goes from
1oowH to AFFLH and the BASIC ROM resides from EOOUH fo FFFFH.
Nas-sve in the 2708 sockets and smitch on.
</p>
<p>
The firat tank was to test the RAM and that preduced no
problems at all. Nas-sys appeared to wark through all. tts many
features and, very happily, when the area of memory from E000H
Upwards 16 tabulated, me can sew that BASIC ys there. Give its
Doand st crashes.
</p>
<p>
Wart states... 0 Yes, I have heard of them, but this 18 not
meant to be a technical article. Is the ROM fact enough to work?
Can the Z80 yead it at JAM?&rdquo; If obviously is because it can be
tabulated and you can even do a fast copy af its contents into 3

<p>
Ram area with the command but the d sty11 does nat works
