For my own purposes, 1 do not so much require programs to be
stored an data. Jn particular, for one application where T want
to use big letters on the screeny I plan to place a 2752 version
of the Nascom Character Generator inte the spare ak bloct and
tise that in place of the conventional DATA statements that take
Min an immense amount of storage in&rsquo; BASIC programe to perform
this function. Twill probably at the same time replace some of
the lene imaginative graphics, such as the teletext pixel
patterns, with a set of mibrautines that can be called from
BASIC of Assembler programs.

Une of the last worries that you may have is that your neat,
Flexible Nascom is getting ROM bound. There i= absolutely no
reason why thie should happen, as long as you do not want to
keep changing from one ROM program to another without switching
offs
</p>
<p>
The full 40k of RAM can easily Be accomodated alongside 26K
of ROM and EPRUM that will fit on the Qual Monitor board and the
</p>
<p>
Dk of RAM on the Nascom&nbsp;1 board. Tt cannot, however, be
Accomadated at the same time and, therefore, a simple switch is
heed to disable either the RAM or the ROM This r5 simply made
</p>
<p>
with a fow TTL chips and installed after tne decode block te
Foute the signal to either the RAM or ROM. What normally happens
is that the ROM is initrally enabled until a signal is sent to
Switch permanently to the RAM. This in called a PHANTOM line and
Ts a camman signal in S100 systems. It can either be a decoded
port signal or one af the PIO linea, in which cage it can be
Mieed to toggle the selected chips and possibly alter. the
addresses &ndash; with a bit of logic
</p>
<p>
ess you are content to enable the RAMS once and for ally
you should Chect whether the disabled RAMS are refreshed, if you
Mant to use their contents again anyway.
</p>
<p>
It is about here that the project gets passed back to you,
since my own ideas are getting out of the mainstream of
Computing and into the specific areas of my interests. If you
want to find. aut shout light-pens, Teletent interfaceay
Bianc-eyboards and embroidery designs, then each of these can
make up a whale article.--anather time though.

<p>
T hope that the above has been af use ta you if your Nascam
1 was beginning to feel a little restricted and you thought the
only way Gut wae a Sinclair. For the price af a&rdquo; Spectrum, you
can implement most of the abave starting from a standard Nascom
Tang that will just be the start of a male new lease of life,
