statement.) Any syntax errors are dealt with by the original
code. I have also patched most of the other BASIC routines which
Use line numbers to make things nice and simple.
</p>
<p>
The characters of the label are then counted and a pointer
to the first character kept for a search, The routine then
searches the entire program, starting at the beginning, for an
identical label. Bath labels must be the same length&rsquo; for the
search to be successful, and any eabedded keywords in the label,
such as ON, PRINT etc. &lsquo;will not affect the routine. Blanks
within the label are significant. There is no limit to the
length of a label, but Xtal wild restrict the maximum number of
characters in a line to 90+. If the label cannot be found, then
this is taken to be an error, similar to a GOTO to a line which
dows nat exist.
</p>
<p>
When a label is found, the relevant line number is
returned, and the line is searched for in the normal way. This
method has the great advantage of simplicity, although the
program text is searched twice. I did this to make the patches
to Xtal as simple as possible, and to allow other comands which
use Line numbers to use the cade. The reauction in spaed. for
finding a label instead of a line number in a large program is
appox. 60%. In @ small program, or where the line is near the
beginning of = program, less. This does not seem to be a
significant amount, since the label can always be replaced by
the equivalent line number in speed-critical sections af code,
(with some loss of Clarity). The routine for skipping over
labels slows the interpreter by only 1 &ndash; 2% so that program
with ne labels will not seem elower than normal.
</p>
<p>
The only statement which will not work correctly with this
modification is READ. A DATA statement after a label&rdquo; will be
ignored by the interpreter, so that the data cannot be accessed.
However, Using the format 100&rsquo;LABEL&rsquo;sDATA will fix this,
</p>
<p>
Now for the payoff. A list of the commands shich work with
the new label
</p>
<p>
1. GOTO &ldquo;LABEL&rdquo;
2. GOSUB &ldquo;LABEL*
</p>
<p>
5S. RUN &ldquo;LABEL&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
4. ON X GOTO &ldquo;LABEL&rdquo;
5. ON X GOSUB *LABEL&rsquo;
6. LIST &lsquo;LABEL&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
7. EDIT *LABEL*
