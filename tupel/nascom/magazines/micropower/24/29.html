NB. Bit 7 of the control word is used by the software onty.
When it 15 set, 2716 EPROMS are in use, when reset, 2752 EPROM
are present. Bit 7 is called TBIT.

Now the listing alterations needed to work your board. T use
the original line numbers, like BASIC, to insert extra lines
there needed. Even without an assembler you should be able to
follow the few changes needed and alter your code accordingly.
Tf not, send me the original cassette and stamps, T will
re-record it for you. I hope that this does not upset anybody as
you can not be altering a board you do not have and I am not
quite copying the original software.

It takes about four minutes to blow a 2752. 1 have burned
eight 2752 EPROM: from RAM and copied the eight again. I have
had no errors. I am really pleased at having saved my achool the
cout of two &pound;40 EPROM boards and a &pound;60 EPROM burner, at the
expense of two 1 Meg resistors. Not bad eh! Incidently Mr. Boyd,
how can I piggy-back anether 4 banks of EPROM on top of my
present four to give eight banks of BK plus BASIC? I am serious,
it would really be useful tous. Oh, and if you are ever in. the
