Program lines similar to the following have been included in many simple
computer-based learning tests.
</p>
<p>
10 READ A$, B$
20 PRINT &ldquo;What is the capital of&rdquo;;A$
30 INPUT C$
40 IF C$=B$ THEN PRINT &ldquo;Correct&rdquo;: GOTO 10
50 PRINT &ldquo;Hard Luck &ndash;Try again&rdquo;:GOTO 20
60 DATA SCOTLAND, EDINBURGH, EIRE, DUBLIN
70 DATA FRANCE, PARIS, WEST GERMANY, BONN
</p>
<p>
Obviously one would enlarge on the program, with random or sequential
testing, some system of marking results and suitable messages to &lsquo;humanise&rsquo; the
exercise.
</p>
<p>
It is self-evident that the basic formula using READ, DATA &amp; RESTORE can be
adopted in all such programs.
</p>
<p>
SET, RESET, POINT
</p>
<p>
As everyone will know by now, the basic Nascom screen has 16 lines of 48
characters &ndash; i.e. 768 screen locations into which you can PRINT or POKE any of the
character set. The commands SET, RESET &amp; POINT give you control of a much
higher number of smaller areas on the screen. In effect, each character space is
divided into 6 (2 horizontal x 3 vertical), and each &lsquo; pixel&rsquo; as they are called, can then
be turned on or off by SET and RESET. This gives and effective screen resolution of
96 x 48; computer manufacturers have been known to refer to this as &lsquo;high resolution
graphics), but this term should really be reserved for the much higher resolution
obtainable with bit-mapped graphics or with a programmable character generator.
As an illustration, we can randomly set all the pixels thus:
</p>
<p>
10 CLS
20 REM * SET X TO A RANDOM NO. BETWEEN 0 AND 47
30 X=INT(RND(1)*47) 40 REM* SET Y IN RANGE 0 &ndash; 95
50 Y=INT(RND(1)*95)
60 SET(X,Y) : GOTO 20
</p>
<p>
Eventually the screen would be composed entirely of &lsquo; set&rsquo; pixels. Now we can use
RESET in a similar fashion. First remove the &lsquo;GOTO 20&rsquo; in line 60 and then enter:
</p>
<p>
70 REM* NOW DO A RANDOM RESET
80 X=INT(RND(1)*47)
90 Y=INT(RND(1)*95)
100 RESET (X,Y) : GOTO 20
</p>
<p>
The pixels will now be randomly reset. To complete the program we could use
POINT to test whether certain pixels had been set, and if so start at the beginning
again. Remove the &lsquo;GOTO 20&rsquo; in line 100 and then enter:
</p>
