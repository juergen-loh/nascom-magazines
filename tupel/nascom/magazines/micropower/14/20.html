PRINTING CHARACTERS FROM THE KEYBOARD
</p>
<p>
In the manual there is an appendix headed &lsquo;Single Character Input of Reserved
</p>
<p>
Words&rsquo;. From the list you will see that when typing in a program you can use various
</p>
<p>
combinations of keys to obtain single characters (often referred to as &lsquo;Tokens&rsquo;) which
</p>
<p>
the computer interprets as instructions. For example:
</p>
<p>
? = PRINT CTRL/GRA/H =GOTO.
</p>
<p>
This does save time and space when keying in a long program, but also
</p>
<p>
causes a lot of headaches when editing. When the program is listed the tokens are
</p>
<p>
expanded to the full reserved words; consequently lines may exceed 48 characters,
</p>
<p>
and when you try to edit them you loose charactrers from the end. It is all too easy to
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;crash&rsquo;. In Direct Mode, however, they are always useful. E.g. GRA/Space = LIST.
</p>
<p>
You might also make use of this facility when designing graphics shapes for
</p>
<p>
use in a program. It is worthwhile marking the chart supplied in the manual with the
</p>
<p>
key designations. For instance, the first two lines (32 chars.) are obtained by
</p>
<p>
depressing the graphics and control keys plus @, A-Z, [, \, ], ^ and _.
</p>
<p>
Let us look at what happens when we press the graphics and control keys. The
</p>
<p>
former sets Bit 7, while the latter flips Bit 6. E.g. The @ character (shift@) is 40 in
</p>
<p>
hex or 01000000 in binary, the bits being numbered 7 to 0 from left to right. Setting
</p>
<p>
Bit 7 gives 1100 0000, or C0 in hexadecimal, and flipping Bit 6 gives 1000 0000 or 80
</p>
<p>
hex. Thus character 80 hex can be typed with CTRL/GRA/shift@. Similarly, 8F in
</p>
<p>
hexadecimal is obtained with CTRL/GRA/O.
</p>
<p>
Character FF illustrates the effect of flipping Bit 6 from off to on. The&nbsp;? has a
</p>
<p>
hex value of 3F (0011 1111). CTRL/? gives 7FH (01111111) , and GRA/CTRL/?
</p>
<p>
gives 0FFH (11111111)
</p>
<p>
You can always try out various key combinations by typing them directly into a
</p>
<p>
Basic line, and then expanding them by LISTing the &lsquo;program&rsquo;. For example, type in a
</p>
<p>
line number and then hold the Graphics key down while you enter A,B, C, D, E, F.
</p>
<p>
Now press &lsquo;Return&rsquo; and LIST the line. You will find that the interpreter expands it to:
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
