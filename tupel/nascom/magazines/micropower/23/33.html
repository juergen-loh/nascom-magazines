small table &ndash; it rarely exceeds 4K. Of course, you never get
anything for nothing. The software to follow the evolution
of the colony 15 much more complicated ; you have to search
the table for adjacent cells, count them, and them apply the
rules to build up a coordinate table for the next
generation. In addition, you have to write a routine to map
the coordinate table to the screen. However, you only have
to stan the cells in the table; in the more usual life
program all cells, alive and dead, are scanned. The result
is that this version of life is much faster for smal
</p>
<p>
colonies &ndash; in fact you have to slow it down if there are
less than 20 cells, or you can&rsquo;t follow the changes. The
break even point seems to be a population of 100, when the
program runs at 6 generations a second with a 4Mhz 7280.

which is about typical for the normal version.
</p>
<p>
Now to the program. [It is started by E1000, and
immediately jumps to &pound;1503; the region between contains
tables and subroutines. At &pound;1503 the screen is cleared
various workspace parameters are initialised, and the screen
header is written to the top line. One of the subroutines
called in the initialisation procedure is SETPIX, &pound;12F3.
This writes the Nascom&nbsp;2 pixel set to a programmable
character generator. My PCG sits from &pound;0000 &ndash; &pound;07FF, so the
address where the pixels are situated is &pound;0400 &ndash; f&pound;07FF; 1f
you have a PCG at a different address, just change &pound;12F4 to
the necessary value. If you still use characters in ROM,
SETPIX should not affect your system, unless you have RAM
down at &pound;0000, and the program will run perfectly happily
with ROM graphics.
</p>
<p>
When you run the program you will be presented with a
blank screen, except for the header on the top line and a
flashing cursor in the mddle. To enter a pattern, use keys
Q, W, A, S, Z and X. Each time you press one of these keys
the state of the corresponding pixel at the cursor wil
change. Each time you turn a cell &lsquo;on&rsquo; its coordinates are
entered in the table (the coordinates of the bottom left
pixel are displayed on the top line), and when you turn it
&lsquo;off* at is deleted from the table.
</p>
<p>
With the cursor keys you can move the whole screen
left, right up, and down. Note that the screen image moves
but the cursor remains stationary in the mddle.) In effect,
you are moving a window around, looking inte an array. If
you move the pattern off the screen its coordinates are
still in the table, so when you move the window back the
pattern will reappear. You can thus build up very large and
complex patterns; however, it is best to experiment with
small patterns initially.
</p>
<p>
To help you there are several patterns stored in the
program &ndash; you can make these appear at the cursor by
entering SHIFT/A &ndash; Z. You can enter these standard patterns
at several different positions. You can also rotate and
reflect the whole screen by pressing R and F. By combining
direct entry and the standard patterns you can quickly build
up complex arangements.
