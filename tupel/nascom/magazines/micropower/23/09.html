I was a little concerned about the problem of access time
for the VDU RAM so the next step was to make absolutely sure
that this problem was minimised. The most critical cycle.
timing-wise, 15 the read cycle because data ts read in on the
falling edge of the last clock of the cycle (T3). With the write
cycle, data is valid rom the falling edge of T1 until slightly
afterthe rising edge of T3 and may be written anywhere between
the falling edge of T2 and the falling edge of T3. Hence as long
as the falling edge of the T3 clock is before the rising edge of
the access slot, there 15 less chance of a bad read. At 2 Mhz
this 15 all well and good as the falling edge of the T3 clock
can be placed about 375ns into the access period. This gives an
access time somewhere in the region of 375 to 400ns. With the 4
Mhz clock, things begin to look dodgy because, with the T2 clock
falling edge just on the falling edge of the access slot, there
is only 250ns before the falling edge of TS. So access time to
the VDU RAM must be better than 250ns in order to allow time for
the address bus multiplexors to change the address bus over and
let the RAM settle down. By placing the falling edge of the 4
Mhz on the falling edge of the access period, you are relying on
the delay time of the gates to maintain a high output long
enough to terminate the wait state. This is bad practice as the
main clack only needs to be delayed by a slow gate and the wait
state may not be terminated.

Now 1t became obvious that Snowdinger 2 would be completely
different to Snowdinger, due mainly to using the same circuit
for both 2 and 4 Mhz. Using the 1 Mhz clock ORed with VRAM a
gated signal is produced for any access to the VDU RAM, ie YRAM
is synchronised to the 1 Mhz clock. Finding a wait signal for
the Z80 that would work at 2 and 4 Mhz was some what more
difficult. However the final waveform is the result of ANDing
the 2 Mhz with the 4 Mhz clock. For the Z80 to use this wait
signal, both the clocks need to have there phases changed in
order to sample the wait gate at the correct times. These phase
changes are accomplished as follows:
</p>
<p>
1) The 2 Mhz clock is shifted back quarter of it&rsquo;s cycle by
</p>
<p>
exclusive ORing it with the 4 Mhz clock.
</p>
<p>
2) The 4 Mhz clack is shifted back quarter of it&rsquo;s cycle by
</p>
<p>
exclusive ORing it with the 8 Mhz clock
</p>
<p>
The reason for shifting the 4 Mhz clock is, so as to keep
it&rsquo;s falling edge away from the falling edge of the wait gate
signal, hence avoiding any static hazards from slow gates, etc
This has the disadvantage of reducing the access time for the
RAM by about 62.5ns, but makes the circuit more reliable. Figure
1 shows all of the waveforms needed to construct the circuit,
however I soon discovered that this circuit will only work for a
Nascom&nbsp;1. A quick look with a 100 Mhz oscilloscope confirmed
that Nascom 2s have different phase clocks, Figure 2 shows
diagrams af the 4,2,1 and the serialiser load clocks for a
Nascom&nbsp;2.
</p>
<p>
The Nascom&nbsp;2 uses a 7415193, presettable 4-bit binary
up/down counter. This circuits clock is positive edge triggered,
hence all the clock outputs have different phases. At first
sight this presents no problems, apply the theory to the new
waveforms and design a new circuit. Unfortunately, changing the
phases of the clocks also changes the position of the load
