<p>
This routine, whith handles all the serial output, is
extremely simple, because all the data serialisation
routines, including the addition of start and stop bits, and
the data transmission, is performed by the UART chip. The
contents of the accumilator are first saved on the stack
the accumulator 15 then output to port 1. An input/output
operation is decoded on the Nascom&nbsp;2 by a I/O PROM, IC26,
which uses address lines @0, Al and 42. and buffered Read
and Write lines RDB and WRB to select bytes of data stored
in the PROM. This data then controls the keyboard and UART.
When data is output to port 1 the &lsquo;address&rsquo; used by the PROM
is 00001001 (binary), selecting the 10th byte in the PROM,
which has the value &pound;EF. When this is placed on the PROM
outputs, all the lines remain &lsquo;high&rsquo; except D4, which is
connected to the Transmtter Buffer Register Load line on
the UART. Thus the data in the accumulator, which has been
placed on the data bus by the Fort Qutput instruction, is
transferred to the UART transmitter. The UART then procedes
to send out this data in serial form, adding the necessary
start and stop bits.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Z80 processor has nothing much to da.
It sits in a loop, reading data out from port 2 and testing
bit 6. Decoded by the I/O PROM, the Port 2 read enables the
UART status flags. Bit 6 of the data bus is connected to the
dine which signals that the transmitter buffer is empty.
Thus bit 6 going low informs the pracessor that the data
(including the stop bits) has been transmitted. The value
initially im the accumulator is then recovered from the
stack. and the routine terminated.
</p>
<p>
You will note that the data bus is connected to the
UART input, output and status registers; which particular
registers are used by any one operation is determined by the
control bytes output by the I/O PROM
