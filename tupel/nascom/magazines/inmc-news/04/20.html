Did you know that we have had a large number of hardware tips sent in?
So we intend to set up a &lsquo;Hardware mods&rsquo; library in parallel with the
&lsquo;Software&rsquo; library. We hope to publish details in the next news letter.
Lots of interesting goodies there, although a lot are variations on the
same themes.
