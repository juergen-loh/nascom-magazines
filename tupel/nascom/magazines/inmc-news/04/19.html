CHRISTMAS <span style="font-size: small">(ALREADY?)</span> COMPETITION
</h1>
<p>
Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
May I propose a Christmas competition for the next
edition of the Newsletter?
</p>
<p>
The computer games I have seen (Hangman, Mastermind,
Moon-Lander) involve a personal confrontation between a
computer and a human being, whose intellectual capabilities
are put to some kind of test.
</p>
<p>
With the festive season in mind, I should like to see
a prize offered for a different kind of game &ndash; one that
can be really enjoyed by a group of mildly intoxicated
non-computer-people.
</p>
<p>
The game must therefore satisfy the following criteria:&ndash;
</p>
<ol>
<li>It must be original.</li>
<li>It must involve several participants.</li>
<li>The rules must be simple, and must be displayed by
	the program.</li>
<li>The result must not depend directly on the skill
	of the participants.</li>
<li>The screen display must be easy to understand from
	a distance.</li>
<li>Input must not involve much typing skill.</li>
<li>A typical game must not last longer than, say,
	give minutes.</li>
<li>The game must be suitable for family entertainment.</li>
<li>The program must run on a minimum Nascom&nbsp;1.</li>
</ol>
<p>
As obvious candidate is some variation on the old
game of Consequences (&ldquo;aaa met bbb at ccc; he said to
her&lsquo;&rsquo;ddd&rsquo;; she said to him &lsquo;eee&rsquo;; and the consequence was
fff.&rdquo;) However, this is literally vieux jeu, and I am
sure that your members could come up with something more
original which could contribute to the hilarity of
Christmas parties throughout the country.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely,
</p>
<p>
T.P. Goldingham,<br>
