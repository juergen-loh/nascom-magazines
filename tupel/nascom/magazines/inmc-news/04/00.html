I must say I am enormously impressed with the continuing standard of
newsletters that your Committee is producing. I am sure you will
agree that this fourth issue is yet again an advance. Many people
have been good enough to write to me and mention their delight with
the high quality of article and instruction that the previous three
have contained. I think David Hunt and his colleagues deserve an
enormous amount of praise.
</p>
<p>
However, I would again, boringly, ask you all to search your desks
and briefcases and minds and see if you cannot put pen to paper or
printer to telex and send us something to include in the next one.
As you will see, this fourth issue contains considerably more external
product but it is still, to a great extent, produced by the few.

I am glad to say that many of the hobby clubs have now come forward
with an INMC Committee Member and that we can soon produce an
International Committee which represents the areas where Nascoms are
dominating or just surviving. Obviously, as a Director of Nascom as
well as the President of the INMC, I am delighted to find that most
hobby clubs have more Nascom Users than any other single product and,
in many cases, they are more than 50% of the club. I always tell
people that this is because the dedicated members are highly
intelligent and being highly intelligent they obviously bought Nascoms.
</p>
<p>
News from Nascom is that most of the products talked about by too many
people for too long are, in fact, about to appear and as they will all
tend to expand their systems the INMC should also expand with them and
certainly the software library could become very interesting over the
next year with large disc systems and with extensively programmable
graphics.
</p>
<p>
Many people have been asking Nascom to make Nas-Sys available to the
Nascom-1 Users. Although quite willing to do this, we are hesitant
to suggest to somebody who has used a Nascom-1 successfully for many
months that he should now change his monitor and start again. Perhaps
you would drop us a brief note just mentioning whether you are for or
against that. Please do not make it too long as we get hundreds of
letters and just reading them takes a long time.
</p>
<p>
Finally, please note that the Nascom Marketing and Sales Department,
and therefore the INMC Secretariat, is moving back to __ _____ ______,
Chesham, as from 5th October 1979, and that all correspondence, etc.,
should be sent there.
