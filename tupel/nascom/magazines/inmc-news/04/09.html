<p>
In general terms, all the parts to fit an expanded Nascom
together are supplied in the kits, although the frame kit is a bit
short on nuts and bolts for fitting a large number of cards. Well nuts
and bolts are easily found.

Many of you have enquired what Nascom products are available as
opposed to &ldquo;coming shortly&nbsp;..... next week&nbsp;.... next month&nbsp;....&rdquo;
</p>

Some snooping behind the scenes reveals the following items to
be generally available ex-stock:&ndash;

Also certain other smaller items such as edge connectors, Vero
DIP boards, 2708s etc. are available.
</p>
<p>
There are several other products &ldquo;in the pipeline&rdquo; and we believe
one or two to be virtually ready. The only real way to check up
on the current.situation is to contact either Nascom themselves
or your local distributor.

LITTLE KNOWN FACTS THAT NO-ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT (1)
</h2>
<p>
Did you know that as most of the machine code dumps that appear in this
news letter were printed using the &lsquo;T&rsquo; command (having set the &lsquo;X&rsquo;!
command to drive the printer), and as the &lsquo;T&rsquo; command outputs a
checksum at the end of each line (then backspaces over it on the
screen); you could type machine code into your Nascom using the &lsquo;L&rsquo;
command. Hence the whole exercise becomes self checking. No more errors
from mistyped code. Think about that for a while!

LITTLE KNOWN FACTS THAT NO-ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT (2)
</h2>
<p>
Did you know that to speed up the Tiny Basic you should use the &lsquo;LET&rsquo;
(or faster still, the &lsquo;L.&rsquo;) command as a prefix to declaring the
variables. Thus:
</p>
<p>
20 A=1;B=2;C=3;D=4 ...... etc, becomes<br>
20 L.A=1,3=2,C=3,D=4 ......etc
</p>
<p>
Note that the semicolons become commas to further speed up the process.
