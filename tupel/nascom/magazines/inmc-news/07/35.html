SOFTWARE LIBRARY
</h2>
<p>
Below its a further list of programs that have now been added to the
library. These are all for minimum system Nascom&nbsp;1 or 2 with Nas-Sys.
Most of them have been reassembled from the Nasbug library and
therefore, although they have all been checked, some of them do contain
portions of code that would be written in an entirely different manner
if the programs had been written for Nas-Sys in the first instance.
</p>
<p>
Where the program has appeared in the Nasbug library, no description is
given, as this can be obtained from Issue 6. Prices appear alongside
each entry. Additionally there is a charge of 15p per order for postage
and packing (Overseas, 40p).

Francs.
