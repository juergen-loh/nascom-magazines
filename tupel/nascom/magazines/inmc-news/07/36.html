There are a lot more programs awaiting entry into the library, and we
hope to include several new ones with each issue. If you have any
programs of your own that you feel could interest others, please send
them to us. Thank you.

<h2>
SUBMITTING PROGRAMS TO THE LIBRARY
</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to receive programs in any shape or form for
consideration for the library. All writers of programs added to the
library receive a 5.00 voucher for use when purchasing library
programs. The philosophy behind the library is to provide programs at
as low a price as possible, so the only other reward offered is that of
putting the writer&rsquo;s name in print&nbsp;!
</p>
<p>
To assist us in adding the programs to the library as quickly
as possible ft would be helpful if the following guidelines could be
followed.
</p>
<p>
1. Include a statement of the program category. e.g. Assembler program
for unexpanded Nascom with Nas-Sys, Super Tiny Basic program for 8K
Nascom, etc.
</p>
<p>
2. Include a clear desciption of what the program does, and how to
&ldquo;drive&rdquo; it.
</p>
<p>
3. Include the source text of the program, with comments.
</p>
<p>
4. Include a cassette of the program. (This will be returned if
requested.)
</p>
<p>
Ideally (3) should be in Zeap format and (2) in Naspen format. This
will particularly speed up the process, but failing this neat, legible
listings will do very nicely thankyou.
</p>
<p>
We will attempt to check the programs for bugs, but cannot guarantee
finding them&nbsp;! Sometimes programs may be modified by us, but generally
they will be as sent. It is assumed that by sending in a program you
are giving us permission to reproduce and publish that program and its
documentation.
