The Merseyside Nascom Users
Group, some 150 strong, has put
together a 64 page, A4 book
entitled &ldquo;Nascom Programs and
Information&rdquo;. The main part of
the book is dedicated to the
programs, some fifteen in all
including:
</p>
<p>
3D noughts and crosses<br>
Othello<br>
Income Tax<br>
Screenwriter<br>
Pico Pilot<br>
Crash Landing<br>
2K Tiny Basic
</p>
<p>
The INMC is able to offer these
to its members for 2.75
including postage and packing.
Please note that the programs
in this book are for use with
Nasbug T1, T2, T4 and B-Bug but
not Nas-Sys. For use with
Nas-Sys the various monitor
calls require changing, other
patching may be required.
