No, not a refugee from <a href="../../03/text/">page 3</a> (we got told off by readers last
time we let a naughty word onto these hallowed pages), but to draw your
attention to the fact that we all make mistakes. Last issue, we
published a bit about adapting the series 1 memory card to carry the 8K
Basic ROM, and went on to describe how to put the remaining three EPROM
sockets back into use. Well the Basic ROM bit works, but the EPROM bit
doesn&rsquo;t!!!
</p>
<p>
Having fitted the Basic ROM to the card, and written it up for
the INMC, in a most un-natural fit of enthusiasm, ! modified the board
for the EPROMS, &lsquo;zapped&rsquo; in a couple of EPROMS, gave it a quick go and
wrote it up, but because of the closeness of the copy date, I didn&rsquo;t
get round to actually testing it thoroughly. Later, (over Christmas),
horror of horrors, fit some EPROMS and the Basic does funny things.
Close examination of the circuit reveals that enable of IC24 (pin 1)
comes on when the Basic ROM comes on, so with EPROMS fitted they are
enabled along with the Basic ROM resulting in rubbish on the bus. The
strange thing is though, that in the conflict between the EPROMs and
the ROM, the ROM usually won, so Basic didn&rsquo;t just crash as you&rsquo;d
expect, but became unreliable.
</p>
<p>
At first sight this problem looks very difficult, requiring a
three pole switch (very hard to find) to switch the IC24 enable along
with the Basic enable, and the decodes. However, look at the circuit
again, it won&rsquo;t take long to realize that the enable line to IC26
(which we already use for the Basic ROM) could just as well be used to
enable IC24 instead of the signal currently used.
</p>
<p>
So, now to the correct version, refer back to the previous
article, and notice that a 4K7 pull up resistor (on the right hand
connector) is used to disable the Basic ROM when not in use, leave this
where it is, but reverse the connections to the other side of the
switch. Viz: IC26 pin 19 is connected to the pole of the switch, and
IC27 pin 20 is connected to the left hand connector. Further, another
4K7 pull up resistor has to be fitted to IC27 pin 20 to pull the Basic
ROM &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo; when the switch is over the other way. Carefully cut the
track to IC24 pin 1 (adjacent to the pin), and connect pin 1 to the
right hand connector of the switch, leaving the existing 4K7 pull up
resistor in place to turn 1024 &lsquo;off&rsquo; when the switch is over to the
Basic.
</p>
<p>
All this seems to work satifactorily, but we have heard of a
few cases of difficulty (even without EPROMs on board), a &lsquo;Stop Press&rsquo;
was added to the previous article about fitting a 100n capacitor across
the back of the ROM to decouple the supply lines, I have found that 2u2
bead tant. is better. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the &lsquo;crud&rsquo; the Basic ROM
generates on the supply line as it&rsquo;s enabled, if you&rsquo;ve got a 50MHz
scope to hand, have a look at it across pins 12 and 24. A further aid
to quieting down and speeding up the system is to decouple each EPROM
socket with 10n, and to pull the data outputs of the ROM and EPROM
block high with 10K resistors.
