DOCTOR DARK&rsquo;S DIARY &ndash; EPISODE 6.
</h2>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t understand high finance, so I don&rsquo;t know why Nascom called in
the receiver. I don&rsquo;t know why anyone would suddenly decide not to
invest in something that is obviously a winner, but I do hope we will
have it all explained to us. And if my Nascom-ERNIE interface works,
I have no doubts at all, I&rsquo;?ll tend Nascom my #250,000 prize, if it will
help!
</p>
<p>
Fingers crossed now. As long as these get printed, I&rsquo;ll keep writing
them.

FEEDBACK &ndash; 1.

<p>
Feedback I was going to be a short program (9 bytes) to give back the
use of the backspace key when using &lsquo;L&rsquo; to load free programs.
Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get it to work. If the author
of the letter can explain this, I will not name him!

FEEDBACK &ndash; 2+3

Mike Phillips of Wiltshire and W.S. Lounds of Lancaster both sent in
Nas-Sys verions of Intabs. As Mr. Lounds has had his published in the
Liverpool Software Gazette, here is the Mike Phillips&rsquo; version.

It gets the &lsquo;RST&rsquo; instructions right, and is even more amazing when you
are told &ldquo;this program was produced by hand disassembling the published
routine to give a source program, after which the various calls were
modified to run under Nas-Sys. This stage was not too easy for me, as I
do not know T4 (or T2 or B-Bug), and a little guess work was called
for.&rdquo; Mr. Phillips went on to suggest that it would be helpful if a
list of sub-routine calls for the various monitors could be printed.
Naturally (being from the Frog Star) I suggested he might wish to do
it, and offered to supply him with copies of the T2 and T4 listings.
All we need do now is wait.... (Or turn to the article in this issue
