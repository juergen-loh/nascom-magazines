<p>
interest in Nascoms in Bradford College where I teach. Hopefully we
will equip an MPU workshop with Nascoms (if cuts permit) for teaching
MPU applications.
</p>
<p>
Can you recommend a book on interfacing MPU&rsquo;s to external equipment&nbsp;?
Something on the lines of a tutor text would be ideal.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully,

Ed: We put several articles on the PIO in issue 6, but a short article
describing the software and hardware needed to control a row of LED&rsquo;s
should be easy to find. Please will an INMC member send one in, and can
anyone help on suggestions for books describing interfacing that are
simple to understand&nbsp;?

MASTERMIND MODS
</h3>
<p>
Dear INMC,
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m sure a lot of you and other Nascom owners have tried the Mastermind
game by D. Ritchie, which you have featured in the mag. This is one of
the best games around, the Nascom usually beats me, but the only let
down in the program is the poor random number selection for the
&lsquo;computers guess&rsquo;, which after a few goes in predictable, 0123, 5567,
3455, typical of its guess&rsquo;s. I feel this is due to the simple use of
&lsquo;ED 5F&rsquo;, location 0C9F. I have worked out a simple random number
generator which works a lot better, using the rnd. no. generator of
&lsquo;B-Bug&rsquo;. (What&rsquo;s B-Bug&nbsp;? &ndash;Ed.)
</p>
<p>
The modifications are:

<p>
Have a go, and I think you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s better.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully,
