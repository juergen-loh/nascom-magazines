<p>
Last month, in issue 7 of this publication, certain allusions
were made concerning our client Lawrence, hereinafter (3 gns.)
referred to as &lsquo;the long-haired Weirdo&rsquo;, and the unpublished
failure of H.M. Police National Computer Unit of no fixed security.
Notwithstanding hereinunder (3 gns. each) any further charge that
may arise from analysis of certain substances taken from our
client at the time of his arrest, viz. 2&frac12; kilos of floppies (we
understand these to be similar to uppers, downers, benders and
twisters), we wish to make clear that of the current charge, that
of obstructing PNCU&rsquo;s operating system in the course of its
duties, he is INNOCENT because THE SOFTWARE WAS WRITTEN BY
SOMEBODY ELSE quite possibly in the pay of the MAFIA (North
London branch).

Incidentally, our client is not afraid to show his snout; it
looks like this:

Allegations as to its contents may be made to the Editor; the
first correct answer will win a prize.
