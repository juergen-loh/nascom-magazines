Meanwhile back at the space invaders game, I wrote my version
about a year ago after I got my programmable graphics board working.
As I had spent a lot of time getting arcade quality graphics on the
game, I wanted to make sure it responded correctly to the keyboard move
and fire buttons (hold to move, fire while moving etc). I have
included below a simplified version of the main loop of the program at
the point where the keyboard is checked. Controls are Z=left, X=right,
NEWLINE=fire:
</p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-13-2.png"); ?>
<p>
I hope this bit of code will be of use to anyone working on
shooting games, like invaders.
