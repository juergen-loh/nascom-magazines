When I started to look at this volume, I was nearly a Dodo &ndash; not quite,
because I could spel &ldquo;Zeep&rdquo;. However there was a vague impression in the back of my
mind that a &ldquo;shift right with carry&rdquo; might be connected with the political activities
of some members of the Parliamentary Labour Party.
</p>
<p>
Seriously, though, having tried two other books, this one provided a
refreshing view onto a subject which has an unwarranted mystique, brought about by
people who can speak the jargon. As an interpreter it is most useful.
</p>
<p>
You start by learning the fundamental operating procedures of the strange 16
base arithmetic, followed by a rundown on the ways in which the microprocessor and
memory work. Having been given an outline of flowcharting, the reader needs to sit by
the keyboard of his machine, as the rest of the book is entirely practical. Having put
in the first program, and executed it, the HALT light glows and the reader bounces
slightly because it has worked first time and he eagerly anticipates the next one. In
working through this course, there is a definite wifeware problem and a drain on the
coffee stores as the dawn breaks and the sparrows go coughing and stomping in the
gutters.
</p>
<p>
Finally there are some useful circuits which enable the reader to monitor the
ports and to operate in an analogue mode from and to these ports.
</p>
<p>
This is a well written book which will help the prospective machine code
programmer to go from Dodo status to a reasonable standard. A necessary volume for any
Nascom owner.

<p>
&lsquo;Machine Code Programming for the Nascom&nbsp;1 and 2&rsquo; is published by Interface
Components, costs 4.95, and is available from your Nascom distributor.
