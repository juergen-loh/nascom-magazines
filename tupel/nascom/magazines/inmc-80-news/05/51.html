A list of 45 error numbers is given in the Manual, with a fairly
helpful explanation of what is wrong. The restriction of available memory
space prevents the compiler translating the error number into the message on
screen. If, during compilation, the buffer overflows, then compilation is
aborted, and an Overflow message is printed. In this case, the MTOP pointer
should be moved, or compilation to TAPE should be selected. This latter option
is a very nice one, as it allows programs of very large size to be compiled
onto tape, which can overlay the text buffer and even the compiler itself,
provided the runtime support package, which runs from 1000H to 2180H is
maintained. The normal position of the compiler is from 1000H to 4000H, with
the text buffer following on immediately. For the tape version, a minimum 32k
system is recommended, and for the EPROM version, a 16k system will suffice.
</p>
<p>
The Run command will jump to the compiled program and run it, or, if
no compilation has taken place, will force one, and then execute the program.
If runtime errors occur, then a message to that effect is printed, and
execution is aborted, with a return to the operating system or to Nas-Sys.
With such a runtime error, you are given an address which indicates the
location of the error relative to the start of the compiled code. Knowing how
difficult it is to locate such a position, the authors of this compiler have
given the operating system a new facility, called Find.
</p>
<p>
If you reenter the operating system, and tell it to Find nnnn, then it
will locate the statement which compiled to live at that address. You may then
make whatever alteration to the code you wish, and try another compile.
</p>
<p>
The miscellaneous commands are simple: Memory, which prints the extent
of the text buffer, and if present, the extent of the Code, ZAP, which clears
the buffer and Quit to return to the monitor. All commands may be abbreviated
to their first letter only, with the exception of ZAP, which must be spelled
out in full to avoid accidental erasure.
</p>
<p>
So much for the interface between the operating system and the user.
How about the Pascal? This Pascal offers the following:
