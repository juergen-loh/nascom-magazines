A couple of weeks ago a new, some what noisey, goodie appeared on the
home computer front. It is the PHG Electronics Programmable Sound Generator
(PSG for short). The PSG is supplied built, using a good quality single sided
pcb about 4" square, and fitted with a 3.5" loudspeaker. The pcb is drilled for
mounting pillars to support speaker and the card itself, but no pillars are
supplied. The card was terminated with a &lsquo;gold flashed&rsquo; single sided edge
connector, the connector being supplied, but the lead to the Nascom PIO is not.
There aren&rsquo;t many components on the board, the chip that does all the work is
the General Instrument AY-3-8910 three channel synthesizer, and there are three
other support chips, including a small power amp chip to drive the speaker. A
few electrolytic capacitors, and a couple of resistors complete the components.
The PSG comes with two manuals, a well produced and printed instruction manual
of about 12 pages, and a 64 page booklet produced by GI giving very detailed
operating instructions for the AY-3-8910 chip. No circuit diagrams were
supplied. A demonstration tape recorded in Nascom&nbsp;2 format at 1200 BAUD was
supplied, this assumes that Nascom Basic and 16K of RAM are available.
</p>
<p>
Connecting the Nascom PIO lead to the connector is straight forward and
well illustrated in the PSG manual, and short lengths of heat shrinkable
sleeving are supplied to insulate and strengthen the connections. The PSG
requires a single rail +5 volt supply, and this is drawn from the Nascom via
the PIO cable. Adjacent to the connector is a 4 pin stripline connector, and as
supplied, a plug is fitted connecting the four pins together. The manual
describes this as the output and phones connector, and appears to parallel all
three channels and connect them to the onboard audio amplifier. Although this
is described in the manual with an illustration showing links, the layout is
slightly confusing as the links are where the output coupling capacitors are
fitted, and the description does not tie in too well with the way connection is
intended. It is a pity no circuit diagram was supplied, as it would have shown
quite clearly what was intended. To be fair, this, and the lack of circuit
diagram are the only criticism that can be leveled at the PSG.

On plugging the unit into the PIO, and loading the tape, the PSG
performed well. The demo consisted of five effects. The first, John Brown&rsquo;s
Body, gave a pretty fair imitation of a harmonium, and was followed by some
birds twittering. The third was very short, and would be a &lsquo;must&rsquo; in any Space
Invaders program, consisting of a missile flying across the screen, and hitting
it&rsquo;s target with a commendable explosion. This effect could drive anyone not
playing Space Invaders nuts within minutes. This demonstration was convincing
because it showed how, given instruction, the PSG will continue to generate
sound until updated by the program, allowing the computer to manipulate the
graphics to suit. The graphics were fast, very impressive, particularly as the
graphics were manipulated by Basic. The fourth demo was a bit of Bach&rsquo;s 4th
Brandenburg Concerto. The program was written in three parts, each separate
channel handling one part. Following the instructions for fitting stereo
phones, the effect was very impressive. The tone of the music was definitely
&lsquo;electronic&rsquo;, but Walter Carlos wouldn&rsquo;t have worried. It showed the programmer
wasn&rsquo;t neccessarily a musician, as there were at least three bum notes in the
Brandenburg (easily corrected in the program). The last demo was Frere Jaque
programmed as a three part &lsquo;round&rsquo;.

The demos were good and gave an idea how the PSG performed. Now how
about trying it for yourself? The manual gave examples of adapting the demo
program to allow you to compose you own music and this was easy. Given a modest
amount of patience it was easy to program recognisable tunes, and by presetting
the noise register, other simple effects as well. Anything more elaborate
required careful reading of the AY-3-8910 booklet, along with a reasonable
