upon your resources. If the Nascom Fayre is a success, then an INMC convention
could become a possibility. But please keep it on a commercial basis
(non-profitmaking if you like). We don&rsquo;t like to feel we are sponging on the
generosity of a couple of members.
</p>
<p>
A number of letters ask for details of Nascom clubs, sorry folks, we
don&rsquo;t know who they are, as they seem as reticent about publicity as we are
accused of being. Let us know who and where you are and we&rsquo;ll try and collate
them into a list.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve obviously read all the letters relating to the bus debate, and
many members thank me personally &lsquo;for all my hard work&rsquo;. Well this doesn&rsquo;t
send me off on an ego-trip, as I know full well that there is one other whose
name rarely appears in print and who does not often write bits for the mag,
yet, whose contribution is equal to many times my effort. That is Paul
Greenhalgh our Editor/Secretary. All the initial sorting of mail, editing,
distribution, filtering of rubbish, subscriptions, paste up, getting it
printed, you name it, have all been his doing. All I do is spend a few
evenings a month at the computer typing, and taking the occasional decision.
Paul does the rest. Whereas, I devote, say 20 &ndash; 30 hours a month, Paul&rsquo;s task
is often daily, and not surprisingly, he&rsquo;s getting a little frayed around the
edges. Reluctantly, he feels he&rsquo;s done his share, and has tendered his
resignation. I can not say that Paul will be impossible to replace. For this
mag to continue, he has to be replaced. But I suspect that no one person will
be able cover the workload that Paul has so readily accepted for nearly three
years. I have already approached a few people to see who is willing, and I
suspect the committee will end up with a triumvirate of secretaries instead of
one. This will be markedly less efficient, but I can see we have little
choice. If you have a lot of time to spare (for no money) and are dedicated to
computing, live north Londonish, are efficient, and can be left alone to work
without supervision (and get it right), then please apply. In the mean time,
thank you Paul, on behalf of us all, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do without
you.
</p>
<p>
Well that&rsquo;s the lot for this time. Any more comments on the bus debate
are welcome, although the course is becoming clear. By the time you receive
this the Committee will have been shuffled, and the next issue will be in the
hands of those new members who will have been co-opted to replace Paul. Again,
our thanks to Paul for all his hard work.

As you may have gathered, the above was written sometime towards the
end of September (it&rsquo;s so long ago I forget exactly when), with every
intention of creating an October newsletter. Since then other things have
intervened and we haven&rsquo;t had time to put it to bed. The delay over the last
fortnight has been my fault, finding time to type up the debate letters. Well
I&rsquo;ve sat down tonight to finish it off, and with luck it&rsquo;ll be off to the
printers just the right side of December. My apologies. Whilst I&rsquo;m at it, I
wish you all a very happy Christmas.
