WORDSTAR FOR THE GEMINI IVC by Richard Beal
</p>

<p>
Wordstar is almost certainly the most widely used microcomputer word
processing package in the world. Produced by Micropro, it is available ready
configured for many computers. However, almost any microcomputer can run the
package, because it comes with an excellent install program and extensive
instructions on how to patch the program to specify any features not readily
covered by the install program. This article describes how to patch Wordstar for
the Gemini IVC and keyboard, making best use of the Gemini features, for example
the cursor movement keys on the right side of the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
[Ed.&rsquo;s note &ndash; Gemini have recently obtained a number of software licenses,
including those for Micropro&rsquo;s Wordstar, Spellstar and Mailmerge. These packages
are therefore now available from Gemini dealers in Gemini disk format, already
installed for the IVC. |
</p>
<p>
Wordstar can be obtained in its standard form on an 8 inch diskette, and is
also available on many 5 inch formats such as Superbrain. Having migrated the
software from the alien disk format to your Gemini format, which may be done
using a program such as COPYSB, or with the help of a friendly dealer, you are
ready to install it. You must run the install program, even if you are going ito
enter all the hand patches for every option. This article does not cover the
printer patches, which are often unnecessary as you can select the CP/M list
device and a standard TTY printer.
</p>
<p>
When you run the install program, you will find that the Gemini IVC is not
a menu option, so you must select the user installed patches option for each
menu option which you cannot answer. Having written the installed Wordstar back
to disk, you are ready to load it under the debug utility and patch it. DDT,
ZSID, or GEMDEBUG are all suitable. If you use DDT or Z5ID, remember to work out
the number of pages for the SAVE command before you start the debug program.
</p>
<p>
I will simply give you the values which I have found useful, as a complete
description of all the options can be obtained best by working it out yourself
from the manual. These patches are for Wordstar Version 3.0, and will not work
on earlier versions.
