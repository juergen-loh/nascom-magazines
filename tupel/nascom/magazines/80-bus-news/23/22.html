ECONOMY BLEEPER &ndash; By R. A. E. Milton
</p>
<p>
After reading the review of the E.V. Bleeper in Vol 2, Iss 1, I realised that
this could be a useful addition to my Nascom, however at &pound;12+ I thought this
was a bit pricey. So I decided to take the cheap way out and design my own,
it turned out to be so succesful that I thought other readers may find it
useful.
</p>
<p>
As I have not got an IVC I&rsquo;m not sure what sort of signal is available to
</p>
<p>
trigger the bleeper, but the circuit below is quite simple and could be easily.
</p>
<p>
adapted to work from any input. The rising edge of a pulse will trigger the
monostable IC1 and this will make the output go high for a period determined
by the setting of VR1. Whilst the output of IC1 (and pin 4 of IC2) is high
then IC2 will oscillate and produce a two tone warble from the speaker, the
tone of the warble can be altered by VR2. The volume is controlled mainly by
the type of speaker used. I found an old telephone insert with a DC
resistance of 80 ohms which works well, but a conventional speaker can be
used. I&rsquo;ve got my bleeper hanging on bit 2 of Port O where it is activated by
sending this bit high, this is simple in machine code or BASIC.
</p>

Whilst on the subject of hardware, many moons ago I built the graphics mod
(INMC80 issue 5) and found that it worked very well but gave very small
vertical gaps between continuous characters. On my Nascom&nbsp;1 this was overcome
by changing IC18 from 74LS12%3 to an ordinary 74123 and replacing R6 with a 10K
ohm preset, this can then be adjusted so that it just removes the gap without
the characters breaking up. It&rsquo;s probably a bit naughty but its been working
for a year with no trouble.
