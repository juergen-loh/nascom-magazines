HIGH SPEED ARITHMETIC PROCESSOR
</p>
<p>
SPEED-UP YOUR PASCAL PROGRAMS TRANSFORM YOUR GAMES AND BIT-MAPPED GRAPHICS
</p>
<p>
The HSA-88B floating-point arithmetic processor is
a 80-BUS/Nasbus compatible board which uses a
microprogrammed 16/32 bit microcomputer IC
which performs arithmetic and trigonometric calculations
10 to 100 times faster than the best Z80
software routines. For example, a 32 bit floating-point
division takes just 90 microseconds and a 32 bit
arctangent executes in only 2500 microseconds. A
large number of 16/32 bit integer and floating-point
functions from x+y to x&rsquo; is accesible with simple
single-byte commands. All accesses to the HSA-88B
are via two I/O ports (selectable from 80H to F0H).
The HSA-88B is a true simultaneous co-processor
capable of performing one operation while your Z80
CPU is doing something else. This is ideally suited to
animated graphics where the CPU, the HSA-88B
and the graphics card can perform their functions at
the highest possible speed.
</p>
<p>
The HSA-88B is easily used from within assembly
language programs. High level language programs

require a compiler with modified run-time routines.
We are offering with every HSA-88B a FREE latest
Hisoft HP5 Pascal compiler which has been specially
adapted to compile HSA-88B-oriented code. This
compiler is already extremely fast and with the HSA-88B
it outperforms all other Z80 Pascal compilers, in
many cases by an order of magnitude. The standard
Pascal variable types plus 32 bit integers (ideal for
financial applications) are supported together with a
full range of maths functions rarely seen in Pascals or
Basics. The size of the run-time routines is greatly reduced
over other compilers because the HSA-88B
performs the arithmetic functions in hardware.
</p>
<p>
The complete package consists of the HSA-88B
processor card, HP5 compiler on Gemini 51/4"
DSDD disk (other formats available including
Nascom 51/4" and IBM 8" SSSD) and HSA-88B
and HP5 documentation and programming
examples. Package price &pound;199.00 including UK
postage and VAT. Not suitable for Nascom&nbsp;1.

HENRY&rsquo;S INCREDIBLE CP/M UTILITES DISK.
</p>
<p>
All the things you ever wanted: The Disk
cataloguing and file dating suites. File compare,
string and byte search utilities. ASCII file
compression and expansion programs. A new system
independant disk repair utility. A new SUBMIT with
fully interactive input. The revised DRI PIP.CON
including all the official fixes. And many more.
Almost all are standard CP/M utilities and will work
on any CP/M system. Supplied in either Nascom and
Gemini formats. The price of this gift&nbsp;? A mere
215.00 + VAT (&pound;17.50 + VAT in Gemini SD format as
it&rsquo;s too big to fit on one disk).

RICHARD BEAL&rsquo;S NEW SYS BIOSes
</p>
<p>
SYSN7, the ultimate SYS for the original
Henelec/Gemini G805 CP/M disk system, suitable for
either CP/M 1.4 or 2.2, Nascom 48 column video or
Gemini IVC 80 column video.
</p>
<p>
SYSBL5 Super SYS for the Gemini computers
and Nascom/Gemini hybrid computers. Compatible with
the Gemini GM809 controller card and the new Gemini
GM829 SASI controller card. When used with the
GM809, support for Shugart compatible and other
5.25" drives. Also GM829 support for 8" and the
Gemini GM835 Winnie as well (Winnie drivers only
supplied on providing evidence of owning 4 GM835).
</p>
<p>
Support is now provided for using Gemini 64K
or Nascom 48K page mode RAM cards (maximum 128K) or
the MAPSO Systems 256K RAM card (maximum 1M Byte) as
a virtual disk.
</p>
<p>
Provides all the goodies of the previous
SYYSes and lots more. When used with 48 t.p.i.
drives, gives limited read/write compatibility with
Super Brain QD and DD formats, Rair, Cromenco, RML
and Xerox formats, and copying facilities to/from
Osbourne. And, of course, the original Gemini/SD

anyone who uses it.
</p>
<p>
Supplied as a full source listing for the
Microsoft M80 V3.44 (or later) assembler. Please
supply your full system configuration if you require
SYS ready assembled for use. As this is support
software, it&rsquo;s Richard&rsquo;s (and our) opinion that the
price should be as low as possible, so it&rsquo;s &pound;10.00 +
VAT. Upgrades from earlier SYSes &pound;5.00 + VAT (return
the original disk).

<p>
NEW SUPER DISKPEN
</p>
<p>
DISKPEN has been rewritten and revised. This
popular text editor/formatter now includes a &lsquo;HELP&rsquo;
facility, and new features for the print control of
most popular printers, underline, bold, etc, (also
user patchable for the less popular types). New
features include block delete, better move commands,
new cursor control, optional hyphenation, visible
indentation (margin) setting and lots more. A major
enhancement is the ability to handle overlay files
so that Pen can use auxilliary packages such as the
multi-column formatter (that printed this). Details
on writing your own overlays is provided for the
machine code programmer, allowing the user to write
special versions for special purposes.
</p>
<p>
The new DISKPEN is suitable for use with
Nascom/Gemini hybrids (using the Gemini GM812 IVC
card), and all Gemini computers, and is available as
a &pound;15.00 + VAT upgrade (return your original disk)
or to new purchasers at &pound;45.00 + VAT (please supply
your CP/M serial number). Versions of DISKPEN will
shortly be available for the Mimi G801 and G802 and
also Super Brain.
