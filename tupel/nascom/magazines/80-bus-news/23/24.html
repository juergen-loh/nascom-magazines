As supplied, the printer comes with beth friction and
pin feed. The friction feed can handie roll paper and cut
sheet, the pin feed can handle paper from 9*/2"to 14&rdquo;. I dan&lsquo;t
think that ait will handle the 9.25" paper width of &lsquo;&lsquo;A4&rsquo;.
Optional tractors are available to handle from oS&rdquo; down toa 4".
There is a little more movement in the pinfeeds, but I&rsquo;m mat
sure if it will take that intermediate size. If vou are inta
roll paper feed (jumbo teletype rolls cost very much less than
pin feed paper), then order the machine with the roll paper
halder.

In its facilities. this printer offers a great deal. It
prints using descenders, which greatly improves the legibility
of lines. Normally, it prints in Fica, with 8@ chars per line.
it can provide Em ar Qe cd ee a &ldquo;4G4E) cpl
or Condensed at 137 cpl. Elite mode at 96 cpl, Enlarged Elite at 48 cpi
and Enlarged Condensed are all readily
available. It is also oossible to print all characters
in Proportional spacing, where each letter occupies only its correct
width. Besides the above options. the printer can also print in
ftalics, which font can be printed in all the above spacings.
But the good news 1 have kept until last &ndash; the printer can
have up to 256 programmable characters! These need not all be
programmed &ndash; it is possible to capy the standard character sets
over to the @k buffer used for the programable characters, ari
madify only those characters you wish. In this mode, one can
access the characters in proportional or constant width modes,
and print in the varigqus weiaqhts of type illustrated in this
review.

It provides 9 different alphabet options for the accent
aymbols required in other languages. Which one of these is set
on powerup is determined by option switch selection. but they
carn all he accessed under software cantrol. You will have
nokiced my use of 4. This was achieved by switching to the
French character set, where it replaces the @ sign. The only
character get in which it cannot power up seems to be the
version intended for Japan. This wees the standard ASCII set
with \ replaced by Y. Accompanying the FXS@ is a substantial
manual, spiral bound and neariy 260 pages thick. This explains,
using a version af Micrasoft BASIC, how to acces all the
different facilities af the printer. These programs will he
easily adapkecd to the WNascoam. Using XBASIC, it is anlyv
necessary to substitute PRINT &pound;15 for the LPRINT commands.
While printing plain text, the head whizzes along at low cos.
Fancy printing slows if down somewhat. as does selection af the
Cuiet mode. This turns the printing speed down to S@ces, with a
reduction in noise &ndash; but it is not terribly noisy anyway!

Print can be executed in a number of type weights. This
example is in Emphasised, and this in Double strike, Not all
styles are available in all faces, but there are sufficient fer
most purposes. Line feeds are software programable in a number
of options, and form lengths can also be software selected.
Both Horizontal and Vertical Tabbing are fully supported, the
vertical option supporting up to eight different forms, gach
with different vertical tabbing positions. Reverse linefeeding
