SERIAL INTERFACE PROBLEMS MADE EASY by Richard Beal

The serial interface is a simple and convenient way to connect together
computers, VDU terminals, modems, acoustic couplers, printers and many other
devices. The RS232 or V24 standard is universal and works very well at speeds
of at least 9600 bps. The hardware designer has only to incorporate a UART on a
board, and a few wires to a 25 pin connector, and the cost is very low. The
software needed is very simple, and nothing can go wrong!
</p>
<p>
But anyone who has tried to plug together two computers using the RS232
link has probably experienced problems. The difficulty is that the standard is
intended for the connection of terminals, such as VDUs or printer terminals, to
a host computer, or to a modem linked to a host computer. But is a
microcomputer a terminal or a host? When linked to a printer it is clearly the
host, but when linked to a modem it is a terminal. The connections for hosts
and terminals are completely different, and this is where the problems start.
</p>
<p>
This article tries to explain how to persuade all these devices to talk to
each other using RS232, and how to wire up the plugs for all possible cases. &ndash;
</p>
<p>
The first problem is that there are two types of 25 pin connector, one
male and the other female. Unfortunately most manufacturers are now so confused
that they seem to randomly fit male or female connectors to their computers. In
fact Gemini have got rather confused themselves, as you will see. A general
rule is that hosts should have female sockets that need a cable with a male
plug, and terminals should have male sockets that need a cable with a female
plug. Another confusing fact is that the sex of a plug is determined by the 25
tiny pins and not by the shape of the entire plug. Also the pin numbering is
forwards on one type and in reverse on the other, as you would expect. The pin
numbers can usually be read near the pins, if you have good eyesight.
</p>
<p>
The normal RS232 connecting lead consists of a male plug at the host end
and a female plug at the terminal end. The cable links pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
and 20 to the same pins at the other end. This cable can be used to link modems
to terminals, or computers to printers. This assumes that neither manufacturer
got confused. If you try this lead with a Gemini Galaxy, it may work, but you
are taking a slight risk, because the socket on the Galaxy is wired up partly
as a host and partly as a terminal.

<p>
Pin 2 Data from device into the Galaxy
Pin 3 Data to device from the Galaxy
Pin 7 Ground (always)
</p>
<p>
Now this is correct for a host, and since it is a host type socket, so far
so good.
</p>
<p>
Pin 4 RTS out
Pin 5 CTS in
Pin 6 DSR in
Pin 8 CD in
</p>
<p>
Pin 20 RTS out
</p>
<p>
Now these look correct, and one can sympathise with the designer for
deciding to connect these up to the corresponding lines from the UART. But UART
manuals for some reason always assume that you are building a terminal and
never a host. In fact if you are connecting to a printer, pins 4 and 20 carry
signals from the printer, and pins 5, 6 and 8 are expecting to receive signals
