I have used a board for some months now without being aware of any
errors, and test programs I have written to exercise the RAM-DISK have run for
over 48 hours continuously without finding any.
</p>
<p>
I think the parity check comes under the heading of &ndash; nice to have for
peace of mind, but not essential. Statistically, the more Gemini sell, the
more likely an error is to occur on one. Will you be the lucky one? (Anyone.
out there won the major prize on ERNIE yet?)

ALTERNATIVES
</p>
<p>
The alternative way of providing a memory drive is via the normal
expansion RAM boards, either the GM802 or the MAP256.

Here is a small comparison table:

SUMMARY
</p>
<p>
The GM835 RAM-DISK is up to the usual high standard we expect from
GEMINI, with the usual level of documentation, and if you have applications
that are disk intensive then this is the board for you. It is also close to
the ideal of a &lsquo;plug-in-and-go&rsquo; board.
</p>
<p>
It is unfortunate that the board is only available with the full 512k of
RAM fitted, as the resultant &pound;450 price tag puts it more in the court of the
business user, to whom time is money. Perhaps Gemini will offer a partly
populated board sometime to allow a lower cost entry to the benefits of the
RAM-DISK?
