So as you can see CCPZ has a lot to offer in the command mode, the GET and SAVE
commands are very useful to the machine code programmer.

So how do you fit it, well I acquired my copy from Richard (I think) and
it in turn originated from the UK CP/M User&rsquo;s Group. Four files were supplied, a
source file, installation documentation, instructions for use and a complete
history/philosophy commentary. From the documentation it was soon apparent that
at least one other file was missing, but fortunately a file called STATUS from
&lsquo;you know who&rsquo;s&rsquo; utilities disk proved to be a similar thing. To assemble it I
also needed the DRI MAC macro assembler as the macros in the source file
precluded the use of my particular favourite the Microsoft Macro&nbsp;80 assembler.
The installation words needed reading twice to understand what it was on about,
but once the basic idea was grasped the well documented &lsquo;demonstration run&rsquo; was
easily understood (except the assembly parameters for DRI MAC which as I didn&rsquo;t
read the manual, I didn&rsquo;t understand).

The principle is easy, and works on the philosophy of;

&ldquo;Notice you rarely need to change the size of the CP/M system, hence, you
rarely use MOVCPM. Well as you rarely change the system size, it doesn&rsquo;t really
matter if the system size becomes fixed, now does it? So decide on your optimum
system size, find out the start and end addresses of of the CCP within your
optimum system. Give the CCPZ ORG statement this data and assemble your copy of
CCPZ to this size. Having got the CCPZ, use MOVCPM to make a system to your
chosen optimum size, but instead of using SYSGEN to put it on the system tracks,
