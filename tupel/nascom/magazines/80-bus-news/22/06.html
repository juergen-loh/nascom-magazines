analysed the circuit diagrams and thinks they understand them should (?) be able
to pin-point the problem without any more info. than this &ndash; please!

In case Dr Dark hasn&rsquo;t got round to the review of Hisoft Pascal 4 promised in
80-BUS News,. here are the results I obtained running the PCW Benchmark tests on
this version of the compiler. Incidentally, because of the speed of the code,
most of the loops were set to 30,000 and the resulting time divided by three, in
the case of the Magnifier the routine was enclosed in an outer 100-times loop.
</p>
<p>
Sec. Sec.
Magnifier 0.22 Forloop 2.7
Whileloop 4.3 Repeatloop 3.7
Literalassign 3.3 Memoryaccess 343
Realarithmetic 14.0 Realalgebra 15.0
Vector 8.0 Equalif 6.0
Unequalif 5.7 Noparameters 3.3
Value 43.7 Reference 3.7
Maths 6.0

No great accuracy is claimed for these figures, but they show some slight
improvement on the NASPAS 3 timings, save for the REAL tests and the MATHS test
where the old timings seemed to have been halved. All the tests were run on a
Nascom&nbsp;2 running at 4MHz with no Wait-states. The options to remove overflow
checks etc. were used, and the most significant speed improvement came from
invoking option C-, which removes the keyboard check at the start of each loop.

Having only: had this compiler for about a month, I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to try
out all the features &ndash; well actually the time has been spent on converting one or
two very lethargic BASIC programs into PASCAL and enjoying the substantial
increase in speed. During the course of this exercise one or two peculiarities
came up which appeared not to be covered in the manual. These were:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
1) CASE Statements. The semi-colon after the last statement in the case-list must
be ommitted.
</p>
<p>
2) RESET &amp; REWRITE. The disk file name can be a variable,permitting filename
entry from the screen, but it must be formatted as stated in the manual.
</p>
<p>
3) READ. The check on a digit or &lsquo;+&rsquo; or &lsquo;-&rsquo; during an integer read doesn&rsquo;t appear
to work.
</p>
<p>
4) FILES. This one had me wondering a bit. During the course of a program a
string included a line Feed character (0AH) that shouldn&rsquo;t have been there. It
seems that during a disk read, if the end of the buffer coincides with the middle
0D0AH char cter-pair, then LF is not skipped, and the next character read picks
it up.
