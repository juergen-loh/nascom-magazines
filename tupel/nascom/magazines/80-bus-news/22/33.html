<p>
PSI (Put Screen Image)
</p>
<p>
Mbaslink format:
RESET:PSI &ldquo;DRIVE: FILENAME&rdquo;: RESET
</p>
<p>
Purpose:
To save the screen image on disk.
</p>
<p>
Remarks:
</p>
<p>
If Graphpac is running with Microsoft&rsquo;s Mbasic under CP/M care must be
taken to ensure that the correct directory information is sent to the disk,
PSI should always be preceded and followed with a RESET statement. This will
ensure that the latest directory information is written to disk before the
screen image file is created and that Mbasic is aware of the file afterwards.
The user should also be aware of the effect RESET has on any disk files in use
by a BASIC program, consult the documentation which accompanied your BASIC
interpreter.
</p>
<p>
If drive is not specified the currently logged-in drive will be used.
If the filename is greater than eight characters only the first eight will be
used. The filetype extension automatically supplied is&nbsp;.IMG (for image).
</p>
<p>
GSI
</p>
<p>
Graphpac format:
RESET:GSI &ldquo;DRIVE: FILENAME&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Purpose:
</p>
<p>
To display on the screen an image previously saved, using the PSI
command.
</p>
<p>
Remarks:
</p>
<p>
Due to the way Mbasic handles the disk I/O it is neceasary to precede
PSI with a RESET statement, otherwise rubbish may be displayed on the screen.
It will be noticed, if the user experiments, that RESET is not always
necessary, however, it is advised that the user conforma with this procedure
The closing quotation mark should always be included even if GSI is the last
command in a BASIC statement line.
</p>
<p>
NS (Normal Screen)
</p>
<p>
Graphpac format:
NS
</p>
<p>
Purpose:
</p>

characters.
</p>
<p>
Remarks:
</p>
<p>
This statement has been included to allow convenient switching to a
normal screen format so that fast scrolling and a normal width display are
