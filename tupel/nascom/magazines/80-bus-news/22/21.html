Powauid alsa like to correct the impression that a Biphase Signal
contains ani, frequencies between half the Baud rate and the Baud
rate itself. By chance I had been experimenting with FFT*"s (Fast
Fourier Transforms) and had calculated spectra for NRI. Hiphase and
Biphase-M encoded random deta streams shortly before the arrivel af
iesue 3. These show that in fact the spectra of both Biphase signals
reach a peak at the Baud rate, and have minima at &copy; frequency fie BO?
amd twice the Baud rate. NAZ on the other hand has a minimum at the
Baud rate but is mat DC free and so cannot be used for taping data.
This is nok to say however that Biphase data cannot be recovered
atter 84@Ssing it through a bandpass filter such as a tape recorder.
(My FRY program is written in Hisoft Tape Fascal 4, and takes about
SO seconds toa calculate a Sif peintk enectrum. }

fan it be that Io am the only reader of 30-bus News to realise that
the FiO*&rsquo;s DY and /STR lines are ideally suited to handshaking with
the printer&rsquo;s /STROBE and /ACKNLG lines? All that is required is the
addition of an LS TTL inverters

The port must be in mode O Coutput). Busy should still be taken Back
to an input line on the other port ta allow the driver software ta
monitor the printer status, unless that is you drive the printer on
interrupt. My printer is at the end of 3m of ribbon cable, but I have
had mo preblem with spurious signals oar the lack of a program
determined settling time.
