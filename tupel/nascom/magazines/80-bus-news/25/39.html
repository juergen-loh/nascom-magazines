Review of the Gemini Galaxy 2
</p>
<p>
Introduction
</p>
<p>
The Galaxy 2 computer by Gemini Microcomputers is the result of
progressive development from the earlier Galaxy 1 computer, incorporating a
number of improvements which further enhance the performance of the machine.
Gemini have retained the modular card approach with the Galaxy 2, an approach
which has always been the province of &lsquo;professional&rsquo; computer design. The
&lsquo;single board&rsquo; approach adopted by many computer designers has advantages in
terms of production cost, but disadvantages in terms of flexibility, expansion
and repair. The single board approach is probably suitable for the business
user where, once the specification of the machine has been decided, there
would be little likelihood of needing expansion. However, Gemini have produced
a modular machine equal to or better in performance than most popular single
poard computers, and at a very competitive price. Because of its modular
design many permutations of the basic machine may be manufactured without the
extra cost involved in manufacturing &lsquo;specials&rsquo;, and with all the advantages
of expansion and flexibility as we shall see later. This makes the Galaxy 2
not only competitive in the business market, but ideal in the system
development or laboratory situation, an area where many single board computers
could not compete.

Specification
</p>
<p>
The basic specification of the machine is similar to many other
machines using the CP/M operating system: a high capacity twin disk system,
780A processor, 64K of RAM, 80 by 25 VDU type display, etc. Unlike many other
CP/M machines, however, the Galaxy 2 has an internal bus with three slots
spare conforming to the popular 80-BUS/Nasbus standard, allowing expansion
with cards manufactured by a number of other companies.

Appearance &ndash;
</p>
<p>
The Galaxy comes complete with all leads and necessary connectors to
plug in directly. A quality 12" green or amber screen monitor is also
supplied. The Galaxy case is steel measuring 18" by 12" by 7&rdquo;, attractively
finished in cream and matt black paint. The paint finish is a high temperature
paked resin finish and is particularly hard wearing, very easy to keep clean
and not prone to scratches. In these days of flimsy vacuum formed plastic
cases it is a delight to see the solid and robust case of the Galaxy, which
whilst boxy in shape is both pleasantly and conveniently proportioned. The
solid case makes the Galaxy feature as one of the very few computers you could
actually stand on without damage. Not a major sales point perhaps, but one
that should appeal to the educationalists or to users where hard physical use
(or abuse) of a computer takes place. The separate keyboard case is also of
steel construction, finished in a similar fashion to the main computer case,
and is sufficiently low profile for experienced typists to find it comfortable
in use

The only features on the front face of the computer are the vertically
mounted twin disk drives and an LED power on indicator. The back panel has all
the necessary sockets and connectors. A DB25 connector is provided for direct
connection to RS232 printers or a modem, a 36 way Amphenol type connector for
direct connection to printers using the parallel &lsquo;Centronics&rsquo; protocol. A DB15
connector is provided for keyboard connection and DIN sockets for external
tape I/O and light pen connection and a PL259 socket for the video output. The
