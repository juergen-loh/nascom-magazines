This example includes a number of the features previously described. The
used may not necessarily be the most elegant or concise, and the example
</p>
<p>
has been &lsquo;made up&rsquo; to show the various points.
</p>
<p>
Line 10 &ndash; Advisable for record purposes.
</p>
<p>
Line 20 --- Clear Screen and print a Title. (Assumes Gemini IVC Screen. )
Line 30 = We will have 3 Data Files. AREA1.DAT to AREA3.DAT.
</p>
<p>
Line 40 &ndash; Construct File Name.
</p>
<p>
Line 50 &ndash; Set record counter for one File.
</p>
<p>
Line 60 &ndash; OPEN the File on drive &ldquo;A&rdquo;, RANDOM, 582 byte Records.
Line 70 &ndash; 110. Set up the Fields for drive &lsquo;A&rsquo;, (File &pound;1). Note line 100
</p>
<p>
the use of JM$ and JU$. MBASIC does not like numbers over 255 in
Field statements, so the dummy has been split. (62+240=302.)
</p>
<p>
Line 120 &ndash; 180. Set ALL fields (Except MK$) to periods. This allows a nice
</p>
<p>
display when Data entry program is run and current state of any
&lsquo;empty&rsquo; Fields is displayed.
</p>
<p>
Line 120 &ndash; Set MK$ to &ldquo;FR&rdquo;, to mark the record as FREE.
</p>

Line

<p>
190 &ndash; Save the initialized record to Drive &ldquo;A".
</p>
<p>
200 &ndash; CLOSE File on Drive &ldquo;A".
</p>
<p>
210 &ndash; 270. OPEN a File on Drive &ldquo;B&rdquo;, set up the FIELDS, and Save the
&lsquo;empty&rsquo; Record. N.B. No need to LSET again since the FIELDS are
identical.
</p>
<p>
280 &ndash; CLOSE file again.
</p>
<p>
290 &ndash; Keep the operator happy.
</p>
<p>
300 &ndash; Continue until 100 Records written to the file.
