In order to obtain the correct bit pattern on the databus the new keys must be
inserted in the driver and sense circuitry in appropriate places; after some
trial and error, a suitable sequence was worked out which involved some track
cutting. The allocation of keys on the keyboard, viewed from the underside
is as follows:
</p>

(Unshifted key symbols shown)
] { &ndash; 90 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
BS @ P O ft UY T R E W Q_ Graph
CH NL : ; L kK J H G F D S$ &pound;E- Control
(old) Shift / . &gt; M N B V CGC XK @ Shift (new)
Right Down SPACE Up Left
Mark these on the board and DOUBLE check...
The next stage is to cut some of the sense and driver lines; a sharp scalpel
or model-maker&rsquo;s knife should be used &ndash; CHECK BEFORE CUTTING -take out a piece
of track about 1 &ndash; 2 mm wide &ndash; carefully. Each key has 4 pins and with the
</p>
<p>
space bar facing you, they are in the order D, C, B, gap, A. Cut the track
leaving the following pins:

Having cut the tracks, check again (and use the Elastoplast if necessary!). If
all is well, insert the new keys and ensure that 4 pins from each protrude
through the board and that the key body clicks into the frame. Now for the
spaghetti....

Any fine insulated wire can be used; I used &lsquo;wire-wrap&rsquo; wire which happened to
_be handy. While no need has been found to used twisted pairs of wires, it is
</p>
<p>
important to keep the wiring neat and close to the board. Solder each end
carefully and quickly to avoid damaging the keys. Wire exactly as shown
below. If you reverse the connections to either of the coils in the key, the
sense line pulse produced when the key is operated will be of the wrong
polarity and will be ignored.
