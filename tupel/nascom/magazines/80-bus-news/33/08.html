Kill Text
</p>
<p>
7B&rsquo; will kill all text from cursor to the start of text, while &lsquo;K&rsquo; will
kill from cursor to the end of text. Smaller ammounts may be removed by using
the Block Delete command. The &lsquo;D&rsquo; command will kill text from cursor back to
the previous &lsquo;New line&rsquo;, and so could kill several displayed lines. (See
comment on lines above.)
</p>
<p>
Disk Commands
</p>
<p>
At any time a copy of the text in memory can be saved to disk by use of
the &lsquo;W&rsquo; command. Control returns to PEN. When the edit session is finished,
the &lsquo;E&rsquo; command will write the file to disk, and exit to CP/M. Editing can be
terminated without writing to disk, by use of the &lsquo;Q&rsquo; Quit command, but in
this case the question &lsquo;Are you sure&rsquo; is posed. In common with most programs
of this type, two disk copies of a file are maintained, the most recent always
becoming the Named file, whilst the other becomes the -BAK &ndash; Backup file. When
the next edit is completed, the old&nbsp;.-BAK will be deleted, and the previous
master file will be renamed FILENAME.BAK. The newly edited file will saved as
the new master, under the correct FILENAME.TYP. If the user wishes to retain
the&nbsp;.BAK file on the disk before an edit, then it can be renamed. i.e. &ndash;
REN MYFILE1.DOC=MYFILE.BAK.
An unusual and very useful feature is the &lsquo;0&rsquo; command, which change the name
of the output file from within PEN. very useful for breaking bits of source
code up into constituent parts, etc.
</p>
<p>
Another very useful command is the &lsquo;R&rsquo; command. This will read another
file from disk, and insert it into the file currently in memory, at the Cursor
position. This is useful for things like Letter Heads, or EQUATES Source file
listings.
</p>
<p>
Find Commands (with Replace option)
</p>
<p>
When activated, PEN prompts for the &lsquo;Find&rsquo; string on the status lines.
The required string should then be entered, and terminated with -Z or &ldquo;C. A &ldquo;Z
causes PEN to immediately start searching. If &ldquo;C is used, a second String is
expected, and should be entered, terminated by -Z If a second string is
entered, it can be used as the replacement string as described below.
</p>
<p>
The &lsquo;F&rsquo; command will search the entire file, (f&rsquo; from current cursor
position) and display any text that matches the &lsquo;Find String&rsquo;. It will then
stop. If &lsquo;ENTER&rsquo; is pressed the next occurence is found. If the &lsquo;Replace&rsquo;
option is active, then pressing &lsquo;ENTER&rsquo; will cause the String to be changed
for the replacement option, and a further &lsquo;ENTER&rsquo; will find the next
occurence. Whenever a match is found, if &lsquo;SPACE&rsquo; is pressed instead of &lsquo;ENTER&rsquo;
the substitution is NOT made, and the next match is sought. The last entered
Find command can be re-activated, even after further editing, by use of the
&lsquo;&ldquo;P* command. Appart from changing spelling mistakes, or replacing
abbreviations, one nice use of this command is to rewrite 8080 Source files to
Z80 Mnemonics. .
</p>
<p>
Overlays
Overlays are a new feature of PEN. I am unable to comment on these in
</p>
<p>
much detail because I have only had experience of the two supplied with PEN.
The idea is good though, and it adds greatly to the power and versatility of
PEN. The OVERLAY &lsquo;Menu&rsquo; is activated by the &ldquo;&amp; command, which displays a list
of overlays that may be available and used. The &lsquo;OVERD&rsquo; overlay for example,
will display the Directory of a Disk, or allow deletion of files.
