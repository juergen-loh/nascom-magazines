GEMINI GM860 EPROM PROGRAMMER REVIEW By D. W. Parkinson
</p>
<p>
At long last the Gemini EPROM programmer is with us. At least I assume it is
with us and not a holographic projection, as our Editor claimed it didn&rsquo;t
exist an issue or two ago! (I quote &ndash; &ldquo;What EPROM programmer?&rdquo; &ndash; Vol 2 Iss 5.)
</p>
<p>
What you get
</p>
<p>
i) A box 8.25" x 4,25" x 2" &ndash; the programmer.
</p>
<p>
ii) A disk.
</p>
<p>
iii) A manual.
</p>
<p>
iv) A connecting cable.
</p>
<p>
What you need. :
</p>
<p>
i) A disk-based MultiBoard system. (e.g. Gemini Galaxy)
ii) A mains plug.
</p>
<p>
iii) Money. (#150+VAT)
</p>
<p>
or alternatively
</p>
<p>
i) A Z80 based system with a PIO.
</p>
<p>
ii) A mains plug.
</p>
<p>
iii) The ability to program &amp; an understanding of Z80 assembly language.
iv) Money. (#150+VAT)
</p>
<p>
What does it do?
It will program all Intel compatible single supply EPROMs from a 2716 (2kx8)
</p>
<p>
to a 27256 (32kx8).
</p>
<p>
Now taking each item in turn:
</p>
<p>
The Box and cable: This is a mains powered unit containing the programmer. It
has a 28-pin ZIF (Zero Insertion Force socket) sticking out of the top along
with two LEDs, (one to indicate &lsquo;power on&rsquo;, the other for -ZIF socket powered
up&rsquo;). On the front is a mains on/off switch and fuse, and on the rear a mains
lead emerges and there is a 34-way IDC connector. The programmer has been
designed to interface to the main computer via a PIO. The interface comprises
an 8-bit bi-directional bus, together with a clock line and an address line.
Gemini have selected and ordered the connections such that the programmer can
be plugged straight into the Centronics socket on the back of a standard
Galaxy. The supplied connecting cable is just under 3" long, with a 34-way IDC
connector on one end, and a Centronics plug on the other.
</p>
<p>
Note: This does not mean that the programmer can be plugged into any
Centronics type interface. On the Galaxy the Centronics socket is connected
internally directly to a PIO without any intervening buffers. Thus the full
bidirectional capability of the PIO&rsquo;s data port is available to the control
software. Similarly the Centronics &ldquo;Busy&rdquo; printer status line can be used as
an output line in this application.
</p>
<p>
If you don&rsquo;t have a Galaxy, or would rather connect the programmer direct to
another PIO within the Galaxy you have two options open:
</p>
<p>
a) Make up your own cable to connect the 34-way IDC of the programmer to the
usual 26-way PIO connection of the Nasom or Gemini boards. (Details are
given in the documentation.)
</p>
<p>
b) Buy the internal -plO0-to-Centronics&rdquo; cable that is used within the Galaxy
and plug the supplied cable into that. (The -PIO-to-Centronics&rdquo; cable is in
the current Gemini catalogue at #15).
