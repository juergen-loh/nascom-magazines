BENER-BOo Z2ZB0 ASSEMBLER
</p>
<p>
Gener-80 is a new assembler which is not only
incredibly fast but also memory efficient. This
is because its editor does as much processing
aS possible on source lines as they are
entered. The processing includes syntax and
label-definition checking, and the creation of
semi-assembled code which takes up less
memory. All this means a great deal less for
the assembler to da, hence it&rsquo;s much faster
(approximately 500 lines per second at 4MHz!).
</p>
<p>
Gener-80 is easy to use, too. For example,
its full-screen editor with 16 control commands
makes light work of creating and editing a
source file. Error messages (not numbers!) are
given on a separate status line, and there&rsquo;s
even a keyboard inhibit to prevent accidental
loss of bad lines.
</p>
<p>
Other features include named tape files
(ith automatic merge for easy use of your
subroutine library), paged and titled listings,
and comprehensive checksum protection.

Only &pound;97.95 inclusive
Runs on all standard tape-based Nascoms
(Nascom&nbsp;1 requires Nas-Sys and Cottis-Blandford
