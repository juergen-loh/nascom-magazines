with programs 3, 4, &amp; 5 to create an overlay
demo. If you assemble progs 2,3,4 &amp;5. and then
enter.

The demo will create itself. It only outputs
messages and will not win any prizes but it proves
it works.

Program 6 is an overlay loader written in &lsquo;C&rsquo;. This
is the one I use for my GSX tester. It uses &lsquo;C&rsquo;s
pointers to functions that allow you to call things
like overlays at absolute addresses and pass
parameters to them if necessary. Don&rsquo;t worry if it
all seems like gibberish as &lsquo;C&rsquo; can sometimes
confuse, it performs in the same manner as the
assembler version.
</p>
<p>
Using L80 to create overlays
</p>
<p>
There is to my knowledge no facility for creating
overlay systems from within L80. it can be done but
is somewhat complex and should be avoided. You
have to hack the code around a lot in memory and
I don&rsquo;t like having to admit that I have done it this
way on occasion.
</p>
<p>
The basic principle used here is that you load the
root module into memory, and then you load an
overlay in at a predetermined address. All global
references will now have been resolved. You now
exit L80 having saved the program. Using Gemdebug,
ZSID or DDT you take the program file and
move the overlay code down to 100H and SAVE it
as a separate file. Messy but it works. May I suggest
at this juncture that while you are messing about
with the overlay, you create overlays that are
compatible with the LINK format (see previous for
details).
</p>
<p>
Using the sample assembler programs lets create
the programs using L80.
</p>
<p>
1. Assemble all programs to REL format.
</p>
<p>
2. Enter the following:
L80 &lt;RET&gt; Run L80
</p>
<p>
ROOT, OVLAY&lt;RET&gt; Load root module
and overlay loader
</p>
<p>
At this point you will see where the top of the root
module is by looking at the Data readout from L80
(in this case it is 01BE). We have to decide where
the overlay base is to be. Lets put it at 200H and
keep things nice and simple. To do this enter:
</p>
<p>
/P:200&lt;RET&gt; Meaning load next bit at 200H.
OVICRET&gt; and load in the 1st overlay.
</p>
<p>
ROOT/N/E Save ROOT.COM and exit.
</p>
<p>
Now we have to create the overlay from the COM
file using a debugger. I have used Gemdebug to
create LINK lookalike overlay files. This is how it is
done:
</p>
<p>
BUG ROOT. COM&lt;RET&gt;
</p>
<p>
F100, 1FF,0 Fill 256 byte header with 0&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>
Now move the overlay section down to 200H using
the M command. In this case we have been lucky as
the overlay was originally loaded into 200. If it had
started at 0760H for example we would have to
enter:
</p>
<p>
M760, 800 , 200&lt;RET&gt;
</p>
<p>
assuming that the overlay code finished at 800.
</p>
<p>
To maintain LINK compatibility we now have to
insert the information concerning the length of
code and the base address. To do this use the &lsquo;S&rsquo;
(set) command to insert the details. Our overlay is
12 bytes long and its base is at 200H. We set 101
and 102 to 12 and 00, then 107 &amp; 108 to 00 and 02.
</p>
<p>
We now have a&nbsp;.OVL file in memory and we are
ready to save it, enter:
</p>
<p>
SAVE 2 0V1.0VL
</p>
<p>
and the process is complete.
Repeat this for OV2.
</p>
<p>
Now create the economy version of the COM file by
entering:
</p>
<p>
L80 ROOT, OVLAY, ROOT/N/E
</p>
<p>
and its all ready to go.
</p>
<p>
Not very pleasant is it? It involves a lot of effort and
no mean amount of Hex arithmetic to calculate the
sizes of the files for the move and save commands.
As all this is done for you by the LINK program may
I suggest again that you go out and get it and avoid
the above.
