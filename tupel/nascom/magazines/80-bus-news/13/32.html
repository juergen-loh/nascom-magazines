some control over illicit developments of NAS-SYS away from the original philosophy of
the design. So in future perhaps it would be wise of me to retain the copyright of any
generally useful, silly little routines I write, and be wary about sending them in the
direction of Warwick. If Nascom want to make something of it, I can certainly
establish &lsquo;prior art&rsquo; in connection with that piece.

So on to printer interfaces. Printers fall into two groups, those known as
parallel printers and those known as serial printers. These definitions have nothing
to do with mode of printing employed, the defintions refer to the method of feeding
the computer with the data it is to print. Now the sort of printer we are concerned
with, that is those likely to be attached to a home or small business micro are almost
invariably themselves under the control of an internal microprocessor. Micro&rsquo;s are
parallel devices, in that data is transfered about internally in parallel chunks
usually eight bits wide. So it follows that a particularly convenient method of
transfering data into this sort of printer, is in a parallel fashion via an input
port. This explains why with few exceptions parallel printers are anything between
&pound;30.00 and &pound;100.00 cheaper than the equivalent serial version. In the serial printer
the data is sent one bit at a time at a fixed BAUD rate, in a similar (but by no means
identical) fashion to the data being sent to a cassette recorder. Because the incoming
serial data has to be converted to parallel data within the printer additional
components in the form of a UART and its associated clock generator would be used,
this explains the higher price for the serial printer, although not always the
disproportionate prices charged in some instances.

<p>
The description of the electrical signals and timing used to control the
printer is known as a protocol. The term protocol can also imply the type of physical
plugs and sockets used to connect the printer, although this is often not the case.
There are a number of different protocols in use, but fortunately these are mainly
international standards or protocols that have been in use for so long that they have
become internationally recognised although not necessarily having the authority of
national and international standards committees behind them.
</p>
<p>
The two protocols most likely to be encountered are the RS232-C serial
protocol and the &lsquo;Centronics&rsquo; parallel protocol. RS232 has been around for many
decades and has its origins in early teletype and signalling equipment. It is an
international standard (although sometimes known by different names, V24, for
instance), and provides adequate defintions for the electrical signals, the physical
connections and the data rates, although the last is somewhat anachronistic and in
most instances is replaced by a series of higher data rates more in keeping with
modern equipment.
</p>
<p>
The Centronics protocol is more recent in origin, and gains it&rsquo;s name from the
large printer manufacturer of that name. It seems to have become far more popular than
the original designers intended because of its simplicity and ease of application to
microprocessor based equipment. As far as I am aware it is not an agreed standard, and
minor variations on a theme have been noted, it does however lay down the main
connections, the type of connectors and the system timing, and seems to have gained
general acceptance by a large number of printer manufacturers. It should be noted that
recently Centronics themselves have departed from their own standard by changing the
type of connector used on some of their more recent products at the cheaper end of
their range although the electrical and timing specifications remain the same.
</p>
<p>
Each protocol has its own advantages and disadvantages. With RS232 the
advantages are considerable immunity from extraneous noise coupled with the ability to
transmit data over long distances (up to a kilometre or so) using a two or three wire
system. Its disadvantages are that interface circuitry is somewhat more complicated
when compared with the Centronics, and the data transmission speed is severely limited
when data is to be transmitted over long distances. When used over short distances the
data rate can be significantly increased, but the limit is still nowhere near as fast
as the Centronics. The usual maximum practical speed for asynchronous R5232 data
