If you like me are one of those people who purchased a 48K (RAM B) memory card
and then kicked yourself for not waiting until a 64K version became available and now
wish you had the full 64K to run your disk system etc., all is not lost. Here are the
modifications required to turn those eight (spare) 24 pin dil sockets on your Nascom&nbsp;2
into that extra 16K.
</p>
<p>
I will introduce you to an amazing little beasty called the HM6116-4
manufactured by Hitachi, available a year ago for the princely sum of &pound;30.00 each &ndash;
have I frightened you &ndash; but now available for about &pound;4.00 each in 10 up quantities.
Each of these devices is 2K x 8 bits (16K) so you will need eight chips, one for each
socket!!!! This will cost about &pound;40.00 inc VAT, sounds a lot, but when you consider
that to update by that 16K you will have to sell your 48K and buy a new 64K (anyone
seen any second hand 64K cards), plus the cost of the extra RAM, I suspect it will
cost about this amount anyway.
</p>
<p>
As I said earlier the HM6116 is an amazing device &ndash; the fastest version will
run at over 8MHz and the low power version consumes about 0.1uA (I do mean micro-amps)
in standby mode. I used the standard version (cheapest) and out of a batch of 20
samples they all exceeded their quoted performance by an enormous margin, particularly
in terms of their standby mode current consumption. For the standard version a standby
current of 20uA is quoted, which for eight chips is 160uA, which would be Ok for
battery backup. However, of the samples I have checked, the worst device had a standby
current of only 5uA, only three were above 1uA and typical values were between 0.3 and
O.7uA (almost two orders of magnitude inside the spec.). So if we were to power them
from one mempack battery (3.6V, 150mA/hours), we would be able to operate them for
about 15,000 hours on one recharge, assuming a total consumption of about 10uA for the
eight chips. That&rsquo;s approaching two years, in practice one year would be about right
taking self discharge of the battery into account, and if we were to float charge the
batteries at 1mA (milli-Amp) for four hours each week &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure your Nascom is on for
more than that time per week (if not, there&rsquo;s a little mod) &ndash; then the batteries will
remain virtually fully charged for the life of your Nascom.
</p>
<p>
Now battery backed up RAM opens up many interesting possibilities, firstly it
can be used like ordinary RAM, as workspace, to hold programs, for CP/M or whatever,
secondly it can be used as loadable EPROM, and if a &lsquo;write disable&rsquo; were incorporated
the data in the RAM would be as safe as if it were in EPROM, but can still be changed
virtually instantaneously when required. Other advantages of battery backup and write
disable are when developing programs, where they can be safely tucked away whilst the
program is tested, or you go away for a-tea break and the wife decides to pull out the
mains plug so she can use the Hoover. Or, if like me you are plagued by mains dropouts
and have to save programs after virtually every modification just in case you loose
the lot &ndash; very time consuming on tape, although I&rsquo;m now disk based, it&rsquo;s still a
nuisance. I am convinced that battery backed up RAM is preferable to normal RAM, and
am now seriously considering fitting 64K of CMOS RAM. I noticed an advert the other
day offering 32K of CMOS RAM on a card suitable for NASBUS/80BUS.
</p>
<p>
So after this extended introduction I will proceed to enlighten those
interested parties on how it is done. It&rsquo;s based on using the eight EPROM/RAM sockets
on the Nascom&nbsp;2 peb. (Anyone still using the EPROM sockets?? If so, my next article
will oe with converting them into 2732 sockets, I&rsquo;ve 64K of &lsquo;em on one card in my
systen.
</p>
<p>
The eight sockets will accommodate most &lsquo;BYTE WIDE&rsquo; 24 pin devices and the
HM6116 falls into that category. For straight forward RAM expansion without write
protect and battery backup, fitting is very similar to fitting MK4116&rsquo;s in these
positions except that a higher order addressing is required to access all the RAM
available. The only additional circuitry is to provide RAMDIS on to the Nascom&nbsp;2 to
disable this new RAM if you are using external RAM or ROM at the address chosen to
locate your new RAM. It is suggested that this stage is done first anyway to check
that RAM is operating correctly before introducing the complexities of power down,
battery backup or write disable.
