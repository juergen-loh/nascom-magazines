than a legit callsign, followed by the message &lsquo;DE G6MFR&rsquo;, then any station in
the &lsquo;earwigging&rsquo; mode will see:
G6MFR: CQCQ DE G6MFR
</p>
<p>
The receiving station, say G2XXX, can then open a communications channel to
you simply by programming the destination callsign as the callsign just
received. So his channel becomes G2XXK -&gt; G6MFR. G2XXX can then send a message
(or even no message), say KN DE G2XXX, where upon you will see:
</p>
<p>
G2XXX: KEN DE G2Xxkx
</p>
<p>
What&rsquo;s the problem? Well, as you were sending to a mythical station called
CQCQ you can&rsquo;t go back to G2XXX until the packet program gives up trying to
contact the station CQCQ (16 tries over the space of a couple of minutes), or
without first having escaped from the program and then reRUNning it. This
</p>
<p>
takes time and clears the screen so if you&rsquo;ve got a bad memory like me, then
you&rsquo;ve forgotten who was calling in the first place.

<p>
The program needs to know when no-one else is transmitting to allow the
</p>
<p>
anti-collision logic to work. This is done by manually opening the squelch and
the consequent white noise is detected by the tape I/O (probably as random
numbers) indicating that the program is free to transmit. When a strong blank
carrier is up, or data is being received, the program inhibits transmit and
goes to sleep for a random period before trying again. Now this has snags. A
noisy incoming signal which doesn&rsquo;t quite trigger the tape I/O could be
ignored or interpreted as a free channel allowing transmit (this sort of error
occurs on signals worse than about 4 by 5). Secondly, white noise must be
present to indicate the channel is freee This precludes any phase lock signal
shaping circuits which could be used to reconstitute a noisy signal, thereby
much improving the sensitivity of the system. Now the rig squelch circuit is
</p>
<p>
much better at differentiating between signal and no signal than the computer,
so a logical development would be to return the squelch line to the computer
</p>
<p>
to detect a channel free condition. For sideband use, a phase lock shaper
could be used and the out-of-lock line from this may be used to indicate a
free channel.

It was to investigate my niggles and with a mind to convert the program
to my machine that I started to poke around inside the program. Now I haven&rsquo;t
paid much attention to the BEEB machine in the past, prefering my machine
which I consider superior and, at least, I understand. Some people tell me
the BEEB is the most fantastic machine since the invention of the rocket
propelled roller skate, whilst others tell me that all BEEBs should be
collected, along with their owners, put in a large box and dumped at the
bottom of the Marianas Trench as an insidious danger to mankind. I know of one
gentleman who made a considerable loss by trading in an almost new Gemini
MultiBoard machine for a BEEB, whilst I know of another who can&rsquo;t wait to
trade his BEEB for a Galaxy when he can rake up the necessary. So overall, on
a statistical sample of two, 50% of BEEB owners are loonies whilst the other
50% have seen the light and should be helped as much as possible. Certainly
the BEEB seems to me to be overpriced and has gained a sort of cult acceptance
which it does not deserve, but then the same could be said for some of the
other machines around, so... there you gol!
