point of view, the shorter the polynomial, the faster it can be evaluated. For
those who wish to pursue matters further various books can be found covering
the topic. One fairly comprehensive book I have encountered is {1].
</p>
<p>
So point one is that derived functions such as nom LOG, EXP, ete are
written for the general case and have approximate results. (They may be
accurate, but not necessarily exact.) They do not recognise specific cases
(such as the exponent in a &ldquo;&ldquo;&rdquo; expression being a small integer) and do not
adjust their algorithms accordingly. This means that the instruction in line
60 (IF A=B THEN...) is almost certainly going to be false. If A=2 and
B=1.999999999..... then they are not equal in the eyes of the computer
although an engineer would happily accept them as such. (Mind you a Scientist
may not, but that leads on to the old joke...) Therefore line 60 has to be
rephrased as &ndash; IF A EQUALS B FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THEN&nbsp;.... This can
best be done by coding it as IF ABS(A-B)&lt;1E-4 THEN.... Here we have said if
the two values are within 1/10,000 of each other then take them as equal.
After making this change the program above will run successfully.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively the program can be recoded to make the calculation more
accurate. By recoding line 40 as&nbsp;... NI*NL*N1 + N2*N2.... we replace the
approximation by an accurate calculation. (Accurate in this case as we are
dealing with reasonably sized INTEGERS. In other circumstances &mdash;- e.g. NL etc
being REAL numbers like 2.345 and 7.916 &ndash; there would be rounding errors and
possible dynamic range problems affecting the accuracy of the result.) This
change also has the side effect of speeding up the program as the two
multiplications are faster than the &ndash; function. In making this change to line
40, line 60 can be left as IF A=B... (but remember the caveat above).
</p>
<p>
Point 2: Binary Arithmetic
</p>
<p>
While we are on the topic of computer accuracy I&rsquo;ll just mention one
other point. Computers that use binary arithmetic cannot hold most decimal
fractions accurately. (e.g. 2.67 might be held as &ldquo;a number very close to
2.67&rsquo;.) This is why any serious financial program always uses BCD (Binary
Coded Decimal) arithmetic &ndash; where 2.67 IS 2.67 &ndash; rather than pure binary
arithmetic. That way the books generally balance exactly rather than
approximately as the arithmetic exactly matches the human &lsquo;pencil &amp; paper&rsquo;
mode. Details of BCD algorithms can be found in [2].

Software Testing
</p>
<p>
The example above highlights another important point that we are all
frequently guilty of, and that is inadequate testing of programs. This program
is not perhaps the best example as it does not process any external data in
order to produce its result. The important point though is that Phil
Dunglinson knew what the program should do (in its present form) and when the
correct results didn&rsquo;t emerge he knew there was-a bug to find. Software
testing is an art. (Think of the unlimited character combinations possible in
the source input file for an assembler or compiler.) There are various books
on the topic that you can read if you are interested [3] [4}- I don&rsquo;t intend to
cover software testing here, but one thing to remember is that any program
that processes data, as well as producing correct output from correct input,
must not accept incorrect input without complaining, or crash when presented
with the unexpected.
</p>
<p>
Just to give a few examples of what I&rsquo;ve encountered: First a minor bug
illustrating what can happen to a program presented with the unexpected. With
C/80 version 2.0 the compiler carried on compiling a source file past the end-of-file
marker if the file ended in a TAB character rather than the usual
CR/LF pair. (Easy enough to end up with a TAB if you use an on-screen editor.)
