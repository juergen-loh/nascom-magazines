This issue, the DH bit is going to be a hoch poch of bits and pieces, I
did have a theme, but since thinking of this episodes&rsquo; theme Paul has landed me
with a load of letters and odd bits to chew through. If I actually get round to
my final theme you will see that none of the previous bits fall comfortably into
it so everything is going to get split in to small sections &lsquo;a la&rsquo; Dr. Dark. Gone
also is the turgid writing style of the last three issues. Not that anyone has
complained, it&rsquo;s just that I can&rsquo;t write as fast when suffering from an acute
case of &lsquo;Esoteric Verbal Grandilogence&rsquo;. So back comes the chatty nerve jarring
style with those apalling puns that I sometimes throw in.

On the software front, that I have been to a lesser or greater extent
involved in, are two interesting developments. Firstly, Richard, having recovered
from his holiday on some exotic island, returned refreshed and brimming with new
ideas. Those devotees of his versatile SYS overlay BIOS program should note that
it has been subject to some Frankenstien type surgery and a new monster saw
daylight sometime around the end of January. This is based on an idea that has
plagued production CP/Ms because of the number of permutations of soft-/hard-ware
configurations available. This has led to a number of different versions of CP/M
for sale for Nascom, Gemini and Nascom/Gemini hybrids, and an even larger number
of permutations not catered for. Richard hopes to have solved virtually all
permutation problems between Nascom and Gemini CP/M machines in one fell swoop,
throwing in hard disk and 8" compatibility into the bargain. All this in addition
to handling a virtual disk option using either Nascom 48K, Gemini 64K or MAP 256K
RAM cards. Those with 48 t-.p-i. drives will also be able to enjoy full
compatibility with SuperBrain and limited compatibility with Cromenco, RML,
Osbourne and Xerox.
</p>
<p>
The second development is a major redesign of DISKPEN/GEMPEN, amongst
other things making versions available for SuperBrain and the Mimi. The whole
thing has been redesigned internally, although preserving the existing way in
which it works and the main command keys. Peter has been busy on the major
extension to allow &lsquo;PEN to handle overlay files internally, and to provide access
to all the major internal routines through a jump table. This started out as the
experimental addition of a HELP facility, where the HELP text would be overlayed
onto the screen, but took on a whole different light as soon as it was realised
that if space was allowed for help overlays, the space could also be allocated to
other things. One of the problems with &lsquo;PEN has been the lack of a DESPOOL type
facility where &lsquo;PEN would background print a file whilst another was being typed.
Personally I can&rsquo;t stand the noise of the printer running whilst I&rsquo;m typing, but
other people seem to think this important. Some of the other features envisaged
are to incorporate my little MULTIFORMAT multiple column printing utility which
is ideal for price lists etc; overlays for the use of true proportional printing
daisy wheel printers such as the Qume and Diablo; multiple index facilities; and
a whole lot more. How many of the proposed overlays will see the light of day
remains to be seen. The list grows longer daily. The new &lsquo;PEN manual (which I
have yet to write) will contain all the competent machine code programmer will
require to write his own overlays, so when the new &lsquo;PEN becomes available,
sometime March &ndash; April, I rather hope that people will start to write and publish
their own overlays. Remember that a major part of the philosophy of &ldquo;PEN has been
that it is cheap, and with that is mind, upgrade &lsquo;PENs with a modest assortment
of overlays will be available at a charge of &pound;10.00 &ndash; &pound;15.00 on production of the
original disk. This upgrade will be available from Henry&rsquo;s and Amersham Computer
Centre, and other Microvalue dealers should they wish to participate.

So on to the pile of letters and odds and sods which I have been given.
Some have listings, and as our policy is to pay per page printed, and that
listings represent a lot of empty space, we have taken to squashing listings from
A4 to A5 getting two pages onto one. So as to allow us to fit things together
sensibly when the time comes to print this lot out, all listings have been lumped
together and referred to by the author.
