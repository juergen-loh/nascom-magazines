NEW SUPER DISKPEN

most popular printers, underline, bold, etc, (also
user patchable for the less popular types). New
features include block delete, better move commands,
new cursor control, optional hyphenation, visible
indentation (margin) setting and lots more. A major
enhancement is the ability to handle overlay files
so that Pen can use auxilllary packages such as the
multi-column formatter (that printed this). Details
on writing your own overlays is provided for the
machine code programmer, allowing the user to write
special versions for special purposes.
</p>
<p>

ecard), and all Gemini computers, and is available as
