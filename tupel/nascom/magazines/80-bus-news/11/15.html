<h3>
TAB.COM&nbsp;?
</h3>
<p>
I think that the CP/M routine DUMP.COM has very unsightly output, when
used on a Nascom, because it is expecting a screen that is wider than 48
characters. So, if you want a program that tabulates 8 bytes to a line, this
is what you do:
</p>
<table>
<colgroup><col style="width: 3em"><col></colgroup>
<tr><td>1/</td><td>Insert a disk with DDT.COM and DUMP.COM on it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2/</td><td>Type DDT DUMP.COM and press Enter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3/</td><td>Type S12E and press Enter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4/</td><td>Amend the byte displayed, which should be 0F, to 07. [i.e. type 07 and
					press Enter, then type &ldquo;.&rdquo; and press Enter.]</td></tr>
<tr><td>5/</td><td>Type GO and press Enter.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6/</td><td>Type SAVE 3 TAB.COM and press Enter for the last time.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
You now have a new command, which will impress all sorts of people, or
{more likely] make them wonder what on earth you are going on about, which is
what happens when I try to explain about computers to the people I work with.
Console yourself with the thought that they are not on the leading edge of the
highest technology around, and probably can&rsquo;t even remember where they left
their towels......

<h3>
NIFTY WAY TO PROGRAMMABLE GRAPHICS
</h3>
<p>
Of all the equally effective ways of producing the character set of
your dreams on your Nascom, I chose to use a Nasbus compatible board made by a
firm called Aids To Industry. This board can be fitted with from 1K to 4K of
RAM, which the system accesses through the bus, or through a ribbon cable with
a 24 pin header on the end. This latter plugs in where the graphics EPROM used
to be. Normally, the board is supplied in a form that requires you to set a
switch to decide which side the board is read from, but if you ask them
nicely, ATI will modify the board slightly, so that it gives priority to the
Nasbus, but is connected to the character generator socket at all other times.
Handier than pushing a switch? Lots.

<h3>
SAD EVENT. (NO. 12345?)
</h3>
<p>
Microdigital, who used to be a Nascom dealer once upon a 1 MHz clock,
have sold their magazine, the Liverpool Software Gazette. It has been taken
over by the Apple users group, and renamed &ldquo;Windfall&rdquo;. I only mention this in
passing because under the new management, and printed on very posh type glossy
paper, it looks exactly the way this magazine would, if it had more
advertisers. They have even thrown out the machine that they were using to put
all those mispnirts in it....
</p>
<p>
If anybody has one they don&rsquo;t want, I would like to haggle over a
Microdigital Relay board, on account of it seems like the easiest way of
automating things like my tape machine.

<h3>
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO.......? SECTION
</h3>
<p>
Whatever happened to the following more or less interesting (according
to your point of view) things?
</p>
<table>
<colgroup><col style="width: 3em"><col></colgroup>
<tr><td>1/</td><td>The letters from all the Citizens Band experts, telling us how we can
set up a Nascom network, or that it is impossible. Can it be that they are too
busy discussing the &ldquo;Smokey Bacons&rdquo; to spare the time? Networking is too
important and interesting to remain the preserve of TRS80 owners and the
millionaires who have British Telecom modems..... [In the event that they just
don&rsquo;t answer, how about an article from one of the legitimate radio hams who
use radio teletypes?] (See Dave Hunt&rsquo;s bit elsewhere &ndash; Ed.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2/</td><td>The answers to the last &ldquo;whatever happened to...."?</td></tr>
<tr><td>3/</td><td>The list of things I was going to ask about?</td></tr>
