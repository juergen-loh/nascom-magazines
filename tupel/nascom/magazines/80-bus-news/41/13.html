permutation unless there is some already existing
reason for making this sort of hybrid.
</p>
<p>
The choices are more more limited than they were
(no 35/40 track drive options for instance) but still
allow the same degree of system flexibility. CP/M
means that there is acres of software available
(both proprietory new stuff at high prices and the
Curates Egg which can be aquired from all sorts of
places (CP/M User Group et al) at very modest
prices).
</p>
<p>
So an upgraded Nascom is still avery much viable
proposition, what you end up with might appear a
bit odd (no flashy box) but still good value for
money, despite the exhortations from the various
big manufacturers to buy 16 bit machines. To me
there seems little point in ditching the dear old Z80
based systems as the availability and cost of good
16 bit software is not justified for home use and still
very expensive for business use. There is very little
in the way of all the useful utilities which are
available for CP/M 80 (as opposed to CP/M 86 or
MSDOS). Anyway, most of the currently available
16 bit software seems to extremely wasteful of
RAM space and very very slow when compared to
its 8 bit equivalent. So much for the increased
crunching power of 16 bit processors, not many of
the proprietory software sources seem to be
interested in using it.

Little tip for PRETZEL 2 users.
</p>
<p>
Rudd Thornton of Largs writes &ldquo;Having saved
Prestel pages with PRETZEL 2 how to get them
printed as PRETZEL 2 saves the PRESTEL screen
image which only contains carriage returns, not
CR/LF&rsquo;s? The answer is WORDSTAR.
</p>
<p>
Load up &gt;WS FUN. PGE &lt;
Find and replace QA
What? &ldquo;Pee
</p>
<p>
(Two returns; &lsquo;&rsquo;P @&rsquo; is
the WORDSTAR overtype or CR
without LF = Qdh)
</p>
<p>
With? &ldquo;Ne
(Hard carriage return = 0dh,0ah)
Options? GN 2
</p>
<p>
(Globally, no questions asked)
</p>
<p>
The new FUN.PGE will print correctly with PIP or
under WS.
</p>
<p>
This is a simple little tweak and will work with
wordy pages (but of course no graphics). PRETZEL
2 now has a graphics printer option for those
interested, which will work with any Epson compatible
printer, it costs &pound;11.50 from Henry&rsquo;s.

The Gateway
</p>
<p>
Peter Curtis, the man who wrote the original
NASPEN, GEMPEN and DISKPEN text processors
has recently &lsquo;finished&rsquo; his latest creation called
&lsquo;Gateway&rsquo; with its companion program &lsquo;Pathway&rsquo;.
I say &lsquo;finished&rsquo; as it has been released on an
unsuspecting public in it&rsquo;s current form to see what
reaction it creates. There&rsquo;s bound to be some user
feedback and he hopes to produce a final version
soon (with free updates to those who bought the
earlier versions). Unlike Peter&rsquo;s earlier programs
this program is not based on a simple idea, rather
it is an attempt to make a simple job of an
extremely complex idea. In the main it succeeds.
Gateway is not system dependent, it will work on
any CP/M 80 machine.
</p>
<p>
The basic idea of Gateway is to allow you to tag
acres of text, turning it into a database without the
limitation of fields or other boundaries. Searches
take place over lines, paragraphs or the chapters or
even the whole file, with the ability to work within
user inserted boundaries in the form of default keys
inserted into the text. The tagging can be automatic
or stop for user intervention, and the tagging may
take place using logical operators, AND, OR or NOT
or on straight searches. This allows relational
searching to be achieved, cross referencing things
within the text. When I say text, Gateway can
handle diskfuls of text at once, across large
numbers of files. So a Winnie full of technical
instruction manuals is not outside its scope.
</p>
<p>
During the search and tagging process, Gateway
builds up its own &lsquo;tag&rsquo; and &lsquo;directory&rsquo; files telling it
where it found what it was looking for. These are
then used to sort and extract data as required,
shifting the text into different orders, taking related
extracts, merging bits from different files into one,
and so on. The original text files remain untouched.
</p>
<p>
The Gateway defaults (and any changes to the
defaults) are stored in a small file which Gateway
constructs for itself called a XXX.LNK file. These
defaults allow the user to swop jobs or to leave the
system and then pick up work at the point where it
was left. XXX.LNK files are constructed for each
job, along with the &lsquo;tag&rsquo; and &lsquo;directory&rsquo; files for the
job in hand. So different work can be carried out on
the same text if desired.
</p>
<p>
Gateway itself is not too difficult to drive, it has a
very informative &lsquo;Help&rsquo; facility which is a Gateway
cross-referenced file itself. This is coupled with an
intelligent auto prompt, which prompts in full for
inexperienced users or omits the prompt options
for the more experienced. The intelligent bit is that
the prompt selects the next most likely command
within the context of what the program was doing.
In most cases a series of returns is all that is
required to drive it. Of course you can break out of
the automatic sequence at any time, simply by
entering a new command instead of accepting the
command offered. Most command inputs occur at
the bottom of the screen, the remainder of the
screen being used for text display. When Gateway
finds what it&rsquo;s looking for, the text is displayed with
