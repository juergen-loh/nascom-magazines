&lsquo;code&rsquo; for &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;Idata&rsquo; for &lsquo;b&rsquo;, and &lsquo;alength&rsquo; for
&lsquo;co&rsquo;. However if you precede the label names
with a &lsquo;%&rsquo; sign, M80 treats them in a different
way. Instead of replacing parameter &lsquo;a&rsquo; by the
character string in the corresponding position
in the macro call, it replaces it by the VALUE
of that character string, (assumed to be a
label), converted to the current radix. That
brings me to one final &lsquo;tweak&rsquo; to using the
macro &ndash; we normally think in HEX when
confronted with addresses and opcodes, (or
at least I do), and so in order that the
information is displayed in hex we need to
change the current radix to 16. So the code in
the source file should look like:
</p>
<p>
.tadix 16 ; Change radix to 16
</p>
<p>
390 we get Hex display
show Zlcode,Gldata,Zalength ; Use
</p>
<p>
;the VALUES of the labels
.radix 10 ; Back to normal radix of 10.
</p>
<p>
If you only want to see the message once, rather
than on each pass of the assembler, the code
can be bracketed by:
</p>
<p>
if2 ; If pass 2
. aS above..
endif

Microsoft&rsquo;s L80
</p>
<p>
lf you have a large program it is sometimes
convenient to split it into several smaller
modules. There are then two approaches you
can take on combining these modules. The
first is to combine them during assembly by
using the &lsquo;include&rsquo; command of M80. The
second is to assemble them separately, and
combine them at link time with L80. In the
latter case use is made of the &lsquo;entry&rsquo; and
&lsquo;extrn&rsquo; commands of M80 to specify which
labels can be referenced from outside a
particular module, (the entry points), and
which tabels are in other modules, (the
externals). However this approach may give
you quite a long command line for L80 which
it can be irritating to keep retyping:
</p>
<p>
e.g. 180 bitmain,bitl, bit2,bitd,
bit4, bit5, bit6, library/s, fred/n/e
</p>
<p>
Which links together the seven programs bitmain,
biti &ndash; bit6, items from the library file &lsquo;library&rsquo;,
and saves the lot under the filename
&lsquo;FRED.COM&rsquo;. You can save yourself effort by
creating a submit file with the above in it, or
by programming up one of the function keys
on the Gemini keyboard with the command
string. Alternatively you can make M80 and
L80 do some of the work. This is done by
using the &lsquo;.request&rsquo; command of M80. The
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;request&rsquo; causes M80 to code-up a request to
L80 to search the specified file(s) for the
routines to satisfy any undefined externals. In
the above example &lsquo;bitmain&rsquo; could be edited
to contain the line:
</p>
<p>
-Tequest bitl,bit2, bit3, bit4, bitS, bit6, libry
and as a result the L80 command would reduce to:
L80 bitmain, fred/n/e
</p>
<p>
There are two caveats to using this approach:
Firstly M80 restricts external names to six
characters, and thus your file names in the
&lsquo;request&rsquo; command must six characters or
less. If they are seven or eight characters long
M80 will truncate them to six characters, and
then L80 will be unable to find the files.
Secondly L80 does a library search. i.e. L80
will only link in those files that contain entry
points that are in its table of as yet undefined
externals. e.g. If the entry points in &lsquo;bit2&rsquo; are
only referenced by &lsquo;bit6&rsquo;, then the file &lsquo;bit2&rsquo;
will not be loaded when it is reached, as its
entry points will not match any of the
&lsquo;wanted&rsquo; externals referenced by &lsquo;bitmain&rsquo;
and &lsquo;biti&rsquo;. It is only when the file &lsquo;bit6&rsquo; is
reached that the external references of that
file to &lsquo;bit 2&rsquo; are added to the &lsquo;undefined
externals&rsquo; table. Thus the files in the &lsquo;request&rsquo;
list must be in an order which ensures that
they are all loaded. (If &lsquo;bitmain&rsquo; references all
of them you have nothing to worry about.)

$MEMRY

<p>
If you are linking together several routines to form
a large program, the problem of workspace
may arise. By workspace I mean &lsquo;where is the
workspace?&rsquo;. In the case of a single program
requiring &ndash; say &ndash; two 4k buffers the answer
is simple. The program can end with:
</p>
<p>
buffl equ $ ; Start of buffer 1
buf f2 equ buffl+4096 ; Start of buffer 2
bufend equ buff2+4096 ; End of buffer area
</p>
<p>
(Note the program ended with EQUs. If DEFS had
been used, the data space would have been
saved as part of the program &ndash; a total waste
of disk space.) The same approach can be
used when you link programs together with
L80, BUT you must ensure the module with
the above definition is THE LAST MODULE
linked in, (including any library modules),
otherwise the &lsquo;buff1&rsquo; and &lsquo;buff2&rsquo; areas will
overlay program code. Replacing the EQUs
with DEFS would solve the problem, but once
again would lead ta wasted space on disk.
</p>
<p>
However L80 does provide a mechanism for
getting round this problem, but it is slightly
clumsy to use. This is the variable $MEMRY.
When L80 finishes linking a program it looks
