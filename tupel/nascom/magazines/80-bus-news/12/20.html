MONITOR.COM and other scribblings by Jeremy Gugenheim
</p>
<p>
Well me dearios, at last I have put Nas-Pen to printer, and what goodies flow
forth?? Read on, and if you have disks, CP/M, and MONITOR.COM (the best thing since
sliced Nascoms) all your old Nas-Sys software can burst back into fruity life!!
Firstly, one and a half mods to MONITOR.COM itself (Gasp!), this one can only be
done if your MONITOR.COM came from Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 (Tee hee!).
</p>
<p>
Do &lsquo;DDT MONITOR.COM&rsquo;, then &lsquo;S2F5&rsquo; and
replace
</p>
<p>
79 DF 60 EF 08 08 OD 00
with
</p>
<p>
EF 2E 00 79 DF 68 DF 6A
</p>
<p>
This gives you back your checksums in the Tabulate routine, separated from your
bytes proper by a space and a full stop.
</p>
<p>
To change the cursor character, do your DDT etc etc, and change the byte at
0877H, which should start out as 5FH. It is quite alright to replace it with a
carriage control character, they won&rsquo;t control the carriage, try 07H, or even B5H if
you&rsquo;ve got the graphics chip.
</p>
<p>
Something for all you dedicated Nas-Crunchers (compatible) is replacing the
Y (copyright) command with the repeat keyboard routine from INMC-6 (compatible). You
can&rsquo;t type it in directly so you need to find some mug who is willing to work out
the new addresses for you. If you are too lazy even for that, then, well, I&rsquo;ve done
it for you.
</p>
<p>
Do all your DDT and stuff, and &lsquo;SA67&rsquo; this lot in...
</p>

OATT OC 21 50 00 22 30 OC C9
OATF OO DF 61 30 O7 2A 2E OC

<p>
For those of you who just groaned because I&rsquo;m too mean to type in the source, I&rsquo;m
not, it&rsquo;s exactly the same as the INMC-6 (compatible) one with the addresses changed
and a RET NOP replacing the original SCAL MRET. So, now the clever ones amongst you
can work out how, by using the YO and Y1 commands, it is possible to turn the repeat
on and off. You have 55 bytes to play with, that should be ample, or you could even
make it execute automatically after a cold start, but note that after the workspace
has been initialised.

<p>
Once you&rsquo;ve MONITOR.COM installed, use the READ command to get ZEAP into
your memory. DON&rsquo;T let the GENERATE command have its evil way here, or you&rsquo;ll really
be in trouble, &lsquo;cos MONITOR.COM uses the old screen to hold bits of CP/M that it
requires for disk transfers. If you have Generated ZEAP then you&rsquo;ll have to disable
the Generate command. How do you do that? Simple, you can even use Nas-Sys for this
one.
