<p>
The Gemini GM 802 is a Dynamic random access
memory card with a capacity of 64K bytes, allowing
the total memory capability of the Z80 to be implemented
on a single card. The card utilises an active
delay line to give full 4MHz operation with no wait
states required.
</p>
<p>
The GM 802 also includes logic for a pagemode
operation which, when used with the appropriate
software, allows up to four memory cards to be fitted&rsquo;
in a single system.
</p>
<p>
Additionally this RAM card supports the 80 BUS/
NASBUS RAMDIS signal. This allows the user to have
ROM in the system, the RAMDIS signal ensuring that
there is no bus contention with the 64K RAM.

The GM 812 Intelligent Video Controller (IVC) board
is an 8" x 8" 80-BUS/NASBUS compatible video
display card. It features its own on-board Z80A processor
to allow the video section of the computer to
provide a variety of complex video functions without
imposing any memory or processing overhead on the
main CPU. Communication between the GM 812 and
&mdash;the host system is through the bus via two Z80 I/O
ports. All reading and writing to the display is transparent,
providing a flicker free display.
The standard screen format of the GM 182 is 80 x 25,
which is the preferred format for most applications.
The card also has an adjustable dot clock to provide
alternative formats. The standard character set of 128
characters provides all upper and lower case alphanumerics
plus additional characters. Lower case
characters have true descenders. An additional 128
character shapes may be defined under software
control. These can be used to provide inverse
&ndash; characters or pixel graphics characters giving a resolution
of 160 x 75. Additionally the user may define
his own characters for special applications.
The GM 812 includes both light pen and ASCII keyboard
inputs. The light pen input can resolve a single
character on the screen. The keyboard input provides
a 32 character buffer to allow &lsquo;type ahead&rsquo; without
loss of characters.
The GM 812 is ideally suited for use in either a AVAILABLE FROM
Muitiboard system, or in a Nascom system running
