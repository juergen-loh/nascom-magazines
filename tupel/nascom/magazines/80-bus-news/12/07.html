This piece of information may well be common knowledge among the wiser
Nascomers, but I feel sure that many people will be glad of it.

The USR routine to scan the keyboard under Nas-Sys&nbsp;3, given in Appendix I of
the Nascom BASIC manual, only detects the initial pressing of a key, and returns a O
if the latter is subsequently held down and the routine re-run. The solution is to
load the keyboard repeat counter (KCNT) with 1, before calling the input routine
RKBD. The subroutine becomes:
</p>
<p>
ocso 21 01 00 LD HL, 1 ; set keyboard
0C83 22 2c OC LD (KCNT),HL ; counter to 1
0C86 DF 7D SCAL RKBD ; scan keyboard
0c8s 38 01 JR C,CHAR ; skip if char.
ocsAaA AF XOR A : clear A
</p>
<p>
OC8B 4T CHAR LD B,A ; char in B
</p>
<p>
ocsc AF XOR A &gt; clear A
</p>
<p>
OC8D 2A OD EO LD HL, (OOD) ; get add. in HL
0cg90 E9 JP (HL) ; jump and return
</p>
<p>
In BASIC, this is:
</p>
<p>
40 DOKE 4100,3200: FOR I=3200 TO 3216 STEP 2
20 READ A: DOKE I,A: NEXT

EPROM Erasers &amp; IMP ribbons

A cheap alternative to forking out &pound;40 odd for an EPROM Eraser is the
ordinary UV Sunlamp. Having no idea whether the power or UV frequency would be
suitable, I did some experiments and found that 20 min at 1" from the UV bulb did the
trick. The lamp I used was the small Boots one and this has 2 IR heating elements
which are an essential part of the circuit and cannot be disconnected. To avoid the
EPROM being cooked I mounted it on a wet sponge and directed a fan at it &ndash; These
measures kept the EPROM fairly cool. Some experiments will probably be needed, as the
lamp may differ from mine. I can&rsquo;t guarantee the EPROM won&rsquo;t be damaged by heat but
they are cheap enough to take the risk &ndash; I have now erased mine many times without
trouble however.

Does any reader have any information on how to re-ink ribbons for the Imp &ndash;
i.e. type of ink and where it can be obtained? (I know it can be done with the
correct ink despite the manual recommending this is not attempted). Incidentally I
note that the article in INMC 80-4 on IMPRINT mentioned oiling the cam. I believe
this may be inadvisable since ordinary oil can cause the nylon to distort. My
interpretation of the manual is that only IBM&nbsp;22 or equivalent grease should be used
on.the nylon bits (oil is OK on the metal rail). I had trouble in getting this
locally and got it direct from the Great IBM (Greenford) by post.

With reference to Dr. Dark&rsquo;s Diary in the last issue of 80-Bus News, the
section titled &lsquo;Another Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 fix&rsquo; contains an error. The location that requires
