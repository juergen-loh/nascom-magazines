Breaks new ground with an exposition of this innovative
language, drawing together the best qualities of COMAL
and BASIC under one roof. Organised into a lucid learning
order, comparable to a spiral, the topics are treated piece
by piece. New material is introduced at the appropriate
moment, taking care not to exhaust the reader with unnecessarily
rigorous explanations and syntactic detail. Roy
Atherton&rsquo;s approach is creative and imaginative, teaching
the subject in a free-wheeling, yet professional, way. His
affinity with COMAL is apparent throughout.

BEGINNING COMAL

</p>
<p>
A book which offers newcomers to programming a complete
COMAL program library, so that the student does not have
to sit and type four-line programs with no bearing on
real-life problems. It enables the beginner to read and
analyse programs, modify and extend them, and teaches
him the fundamentals of programming in a straight-forward
manner. No previous knowledge of computers is
necessary.
</p>
<p>
The programmes are based on applications of computers
</p>
<p>
to games, general administration, programmed learning,
</p>
<p>
and even small business. Some are highlighted by structured
diagrams, introducing a powerful way of picturing programmes
&mdash; a feature quite new to books on programming
at this level.
