also still thinks that items of the genus computer were designed to fit together
effortlessly.
</p>
<p>
The really BIG error was, of course, in the literature. Not once did any of
the manuals state that the D-DOS software was written for a N-2 and that it would
only work on a N-1 if (and only if) the N-1 was running at 4MHz, all you&rsquo;d get at
2MHz would be a clunk, a wheerr (if you get my meaning) and a system crash. [Ra. &ndash; We
can think of no reason why D-DOS/G805 shouldn&rsquo;t be run at 2MHz. Perhaps your Nascom
cloek is running very slow, as below about 1.85MHz the software loop isn&rsquo;t fast
enough to get the data. | This fact took me a couple of hours of grief and worry,
while standing ankle deep in bits of my favourite computer, to find out (not to
mention a peak rate telephone call to EV Computing in Manchester).
</p>
<p>
When the thing was running &lsquo;right proper like&rsquo; another problem raised its
head (as usual). The original address of the D-DOS software is B000H which messes up
the memory map of a 48K machine (brag, brag) very nicely. To overcome this problem T
moved D-DOS up to D000H. After disassembling the first 1K of D-DOS by hand, I came up
with the following &ndash;
</p>
<p>
B000 C300B4 BO10 C370B2 BO13 C3A5B2 BO16 C331B0 BO19 C3DAB2 BO1C C3A1B3
BO1F C373B1 BO22 C304B2 BO25 C339B2 BO28 C324B1 BO2E C307B1 BOSF CDO7BI1
BO42 CDE3BO BO4C C24BBO BO53 CDC4BO BOGF CD60BO BO7E CD57BO BO86 CD60B0
BO95 CD57BO BO9D CD57BO BOB3 CD57BO
</p>
<p>
From the above, I think you can see that the only thing you need do to D-DOS
to move it to another memory location is to alter the addresses of all the JUMPS and
subroutine CALLS to the new address. For example, to run D-DOS at D000 change all the
jump and call addresses from BXXX to DXXX. To access a disk under Nas-Sys&nbsp;3, all I
have to do is type &lsquo;D&rsquo; and &lsquo;NL&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m straight into D-DOS.
</p>
<p>
Also of some minor interest is the fact that D-DOS is no longer in EPROM but
in a 2K block of non-volatile RAM which is write protected and it seems happy there!

Many thanks for a fine magazine &ndash; it was the quality of this, with all its
information on hardware etc that finally persuaded me to purchase a Nascom&nbsp;2. Even if
I hadn&rsquo;t bought a WNascom it is worth buying the mag. for the &lsquo;Teach Yourself Z80&rsquo;
series alone &ndash; many thanks to Dave Hunt. [Ea. &ndash; Spare the blushes Dave, I haven&rsquo;t
published the letter that slates you something rotten! | It took me quite a few
readings to understand B2HEX, but I finally got the jist of it. I then found that in
my Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 the routine was different (but much easier to work out). I even plucked
up courage to single step thro&rsquo; the routine, and then wished I hadn&rsquo;t &ndash; it was only a
few days later that I came across the fact that certain Nas-Sys routines cannot be
Poort | stepped! Anyway, I am still looking forward to the rest of the series. [Bd. &ndash;

Finally, are there any other readers in the King&rsquo;s Lynn area who would like
to make contact?

EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE &ndash; Letters are very welcome on any Nascom/Gemini related topic and the
author of any letter published will receive &pound;3. We also would very much like to hear
from you about any computer clubs which have been set up, or which are in the process
of being formed. Perhaps representatives of the various clubs could write giving
details of their meetings and activities as their are probably lots of potential
members reading this.
