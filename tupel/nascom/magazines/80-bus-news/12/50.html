&lt;c REAL ADVENTURE =
</p>
<p>
Adventures are possibly the most fascinating and addictive computer games,
but until now REAL adventures have only been available for machines with
disks or a lot of memory &ndash; and at high prices.
</p>
<p>
Not any more! Level 9 adventures need no disks: just Nas-Sys and 16K or
32K of memory, depending on version. The versions differ only in the size
of text descriptions and in price: only &pound;8 for 16K and &pound;10 for 32K games.
</p>
<p>
In the games, the program acts as your eyes and ears to a fantastic world
of welrd settings, creatures from myth and legend, subtle puzzles, great
risks and greater rewards... and, of course, magic.
</p>
<p>
Each adventure has over 200 individually described locations, and large
numbers of treasures and creatures. In fact, a game may take you weeks to
solve &ndash; but we provide a save command so that you can return to everyday
life for a while and continue the game later; and we&rsquo;ll give a hint if you
get stuck, However, playing the games could not be simpler &ndash; you just
type in English phrases to tell the program what you want to do.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Level 9 adventures are written in a super-compact Jamguage called ta-code!
and use text compressed to a fraction of normal. This makes them possible.

Adventure 16k
</p>
<p>
The maintrame game Adventure has
become a classic. Now, for the first
time, you can play this 16K version
on your Nascom. Descend into the
mysterious Colossal Cave, marvel at
the wonders within, collect the treasures
that lie buried deep inside; keep
your wits about you as you face
various hazards such as killer dwarvas,
fierce green snakes all preventing
exploration of the cave.
</p>
<p>
As you wander around the scores of
&lsquo;rooms&rsquo; (directing your quest with
English words as commands) you become
deeply absorbed in this new and
fascinating version of the &lsquo;Adventurd
game. As demonstrated at the 1981
PCW Show and Compec &lsquo;81.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
We think this is the most advanced
assembler yet available for the
</p>
<p>
Nascom. Specially designed to get
optimal use for programmers using the
NAS-SYS series of monitors, source
programs can be stored much more
compactly due to its remarkable text
compression feature. Its powerful
macro facility allows easy duplication
of repetitive sequences of instructions
or the implementation of &lsquo;extra&rsquo;
instructions. Among its many features
are Conditional assembly, Multi-line
statements,Full error descriptions,
Assembly to memory, memory plus displacement,
or nowhereExtra mnemonics
including RCAL, SCAL, ROUT,CLA
etc. Powerful pseudo-ops. &mdash;_
When writing Z80 assembly programs
you need powerful software tools.
</p>
<p>
The ZAP Z80 Assembler is one of
these tools; it makes the assembly
</p>
<p>
Assembler writer&rsquo;s task a great deal easier.
