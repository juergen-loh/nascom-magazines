Here comes the mystery. The normal disks seem perfect. They format faultlessly in
anything; the Gemini at 780K per disk using Teac drives, a couple of Walters XTs
using NEC drives, the IBM&nbsp;AT with Epson drives, and Walters AT clones with both
80 and 40 track NEC and Mitsubishi drives. Perfect in my anonymous AT clone
which uses Korean Ho-Shin drives which appear to be a component for component
Teac clone, even down to the positions of the screws securing the front bezel so the
fronts are interchangeable with Teac. They even formatted in an old Shugart 48 tpi
drive with notoriously low head current which usually refuses to format anything
(although it will usually write to pre-formatted disks). They even work well in both
the firm&rsquo;s old Commodore 8096s fitted with the infamously unreliable Commodore
modified Micropolis drives.

How about the high capacity disks&nbsp;? All I can say is the results are variable. All disks
format perfectly in the IBM&nbsp;AT with the Epson drives. All but one formatted
faultlessly in my clone with the Ho-Shin drives, and the one that failed came up with
an inexplicable and undocumented DOS error message. &lsquo;Parameters incompatible&rsquo;
&mdash; remember this was a virgin unformatted disk &ndash; so where the parameters came
from, I don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;! I fixed that one by using a loudspeaker magnet which erased
whatever was on the disk, which it read before it tried to formatted the disk. The
Teacs in the Gemini couldn&rsquo;t be tested as they are only &lsquo;normal&rsquo; drives with no
double data rate ability. The oddballs were the NEC and Mitsubishi drives in the
Walters. The Mitsubishi would format most disks most of the time, but occasionally,
they would throw out error after error, flagging out anything between 10K and 500K
in duff tracks, But the next time you formatted the same disk it would be perfect.
The NEC was worse, only about 30% of disks formatted perfectly (and the same
disks had worked perfectly in the IBM and my clone), the remainder would throw
out anything between 100K and 200K of duff tracks, mainly on side &lsquo;I&rsquo;. The same
disk would be alarmingly variable, one time round it would be-100K of errors, the
next time, 200K. The only thing noted was that more times you formatted them, the
number of errors on average was less. I suppose if you formatted them enough they&rsquo;d
end up Ok, but I don&rsquo;t trust these disks in the Walters.

Did I try Mydisk&rsquo;s 2 for 1 replacement &ndash; no I haven&rsquo;t yet. The disks are Ok in my
machine and once formatted seem to read and write Ok in all the others. The errors
seem to be only on formatting. I can only guess that the head currents of the drives
differ and the disks are a bit marginal on side &lsquo;1&rsquo;. Sometime I&rsquo;ll think of someway of
proving this. On the other hand perhaps I won&rsquo;t. The disks seem to work Ok and
they are cheap. Would I recommend them&nbsp;? or will I buy some more&nbsp;? If you have
a genuine IBM&nbsp;AT with Epson drives, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ever discover anything
was amiss, otherwise you could have problems. Yes I think I&rsquo;ll buy some more.
