&lsquo;The bug us PCB i also easly Bxed sf you have a PASCAL compiler, which I doo&rsquo;. 1 did get

1 reported the HiSoft C beg to HiSof, who replied quickly explaning that it 6 CP/M which is
actually at fault&rdquo; {{ relates 10 the keyhu() Tunction which docs &lsquo;ot work correctly with rawin()
due to the lack of direct console status checlng im CP/M 22. Other than that 1 have found this 10
fea very good prod despite we fac tat dont posess Dr Dane&rsquo;s brary Infact bre 9

programs (and the Nascom manual), Z80 muchne code from the Mosick techncal manual (an excelent
Socument, but they would never claim it 19 be (word) and PASCAL from nothing (we didat even have
the manual (Oope!). t oust admit I failed to learn ALGOL this way but 1 blame thom sot hawng

Ths&rsquo; aol &lsquo;simpy to learn C, nor is i to fx the bug ((hough I have done that) 1 fad i
enlrely mmadequate that it has no. hard-copy options, so 1 am wing those mto my C version as

&lsquo;While on the subject of Jearmng to use things, 1 must disagree with Dr Dark regarding Gempen
and Worduar&rdquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;have used Gempen&rsquo; a bit but fouid it most aneoaventent..&rdquo; Wordsar, however, seems
fly self-explanatory by companson, and the rum reason for the two Key commands such as &ldquo;KO.

ociments and source Glee T-aggee WordStar costs s lot, but at w a fop quality product and you
&lsquo;et what you pay for

<p>
Regarding the Nascom anniversary &ldquo;happen, I would like to see something &ldquo;proper&rdquo; (Le, a
bit more: than afew people ina pub) but T would not wish to see the cost get beyond the less
wealthy smong us) Equipment demor would be nice,

<p>
As to LBMs i Scopio News, 1&rsquo;s probably 1 good sdea they are uated diferemly
from &lsquo;the &ldquo;colourful comes&rdquo; (ve. lite you already do wih S-BUS stuf). The LAM is rather les
of 8 &ldquo;black bor&rdquo; thaa most but generally still rather more of ose than B0-BUS equipmest, would be
ie to see it &ldquo;exposed&rdquo;

RAM-disk makes life bearable

Dear Sir,

<p>
1 totally disagree with Dave Hunt&rsquo;s comments ia Issue 1, p35 about the general uiclessncss of
femended memory either as pageable execuable RAM, or a virtual disk (RAMCdicE). 1 happen use
fo MAP&rdquo; 256K RAM. cards ("= S12K) as vstual disk with a Nascom-2 (S2K paging), and find it almost
indispensable
</p>
<p>
1 have never writen oF intend to write (for the Z80) single programs which exceed the 62K
&lsquo;TPA, bul is primary funcuon IS ai a RAMdck. I&rsquo;s not a case of bunng something &ldquo;bgger than
you (0 doot Know any other &lsquo;Nascom users around here), W&rsquo;s the fact that when. editing lage text
Fles eg source code or data Isis the whole fle can be held in RAM at once, alowag eding 10

<p>
without disk wats. Wordstars swapping overlays in and out is unnotcable. I tind waiting
for&rsquo; dick &ldquo;access tirevome nowadays &ndash; I suppour it woulda&rsquo; be such a problem if 1 was running 2

<p>
The speed of assembly and complaton is also greatly umproved (with the output to RAM-disk,
naturally), and making muliple copies of u disk is a soap whea the whole disk canbe beld ia
