1 had never touched MS-DOS uni I picked up my AT, so when { got my machine bome, 1 set about
the &lsquo;MS-DOS 32 musual and discovered that i wan, in ay opinion, jst a nip! of CPIM. 22
But with the addition of tree directories, directory hathing. sad&rsquo; more &lsquo;support for program
Fendeney I i&rsquo;s presentation and. thendiess are poor und sapdash (eg you ype DIR te haves
ise diapres oh top of the, screen, oF DIR. to tn wid ithout tual space
cecupied ele). i more cemincent of CPIM&rdquo; 11 i ite (rendisess And. tks. veruoa 3,
God knows what the early versions wore ike! CP/M 22 patched wits CCPZ leaves sanding and 2CPR

My Get ak then as to ge the OK die configured for relbie,operaton and then, the
720k format oo the HD drive would be an easy nex task. I constructed a CONFIGSYS file with EDLIN
(uch though. basic, is quite adequate and stable for the creation of batch fies). 1 &ldquo;worked out
that for a system with 2 floppies and 1 wisnie, the first memory device ia the list would be
sllocated 0 logical device D, the next to ete. wed the atement

rebooted, did FORMAT D: and the disk formated perfectly 1 mast admit that I id mess around with

had by ths
&ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; analysis of tbe a

imperfections taken together produce low reliability and hgh inscrata

I therefore decided that 1 would by-pass any &lsquo;auto density 4 distinct
cntnes in my CONFIGSYS fle for each deasty 1 would be using and sot depend on the MS-DOS logical
devices A. and B. My CONFIG SYS file now looked something like tis&raquo;
