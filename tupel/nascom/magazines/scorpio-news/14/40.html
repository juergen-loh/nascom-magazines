So four or five years ago I taught ayself DB, that way DBIT version 20 at the time, and over
period of time DB wes, the ukimate version for CP/M&rdquo; being version 243. Adhlow-Tate ported
Merson&rsquo; 243 to the TBM&rsquo; wich vartualy so changes and so a was uable with the same interpreted
Programs on either&rdquo; machine, the only obvious aifereace emg that the Sletype exeasion had&rsquo; been
&lsquo;hanged from CMO co PR, annoying!

<p>
&lsquo;Then came DBIIL, an ongiaal version writen for 16 bit processors and MS-DOS. This bad
&lsquo;changed&rsquo; a lot, some changes for the beter, some for the worse and some for oo oppareat reason at
a&ldquo; don&rsquo;t &lsquo;unend to conceatrate on that version, but rather on DBI, an. even. gee version
&lsquo;which has been around for about a&rdquo; year now. Most of &lsquo;what T wil say&rdquo; applics to DBIll equal,
DBI +i just bigger ail (1 dia&rsquo; say beter, i&rsquo;s noticeably slower)
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The diferences berwcen DBM and DBI, well not a lot realy, some symtacucal changes and
the change of the odd. command word here and there. Pechaps the&rsquo; most useful change was the way
&lsquo;sigaments were done, in DBII the exremely messy:
