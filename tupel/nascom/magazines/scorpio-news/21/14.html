In the short time I have had this package, I have produced PCBs for two pieces of
equipment &ndash; a pH meter, lightmeter etc. and the results have been quite
acceptable. The author claims that this is a simple computer-aided design package
&ndash; and it certainly does not aim to compete with the more costly end of the market.
Most users will find it perfectly adequate, once they become accustomed to it. I
found the package relatively easy to use, and without evident &ldquo;bugs&rdquo;, but felt that
the restricted nature of the library of predefined shapes was a disadvantage. A more
important disadvantage is the lack of a facility to define shapes for use on future
occasions.

<p>
Compared with the DROEGE PCB program which is available for PCs and clones,
this one is much less sophisticated. A &ldquo;Shareware&rdquo; cut-down version of DROEGE
is available for &pound;5 &ndash; the full version costs about &pound;92 but has an amazing range of
facilities (including multilayer capability and excellent libraries to which more,
user-defined shapes &ndash; such as connector or pad clusters &ndash; can be added).
</p>
<p>
Pineapple Software do a similar program for the BBC range which is very good but
restricted in its some of its capabilities. The track pattern dumps are done in quad.
density and need little attention if they are to be used as PCB masters. Another
useful feature is the component mounting plan, but the size of PCB is limited at 8"
x 5.6" and users cannot create their own library of standard shapes, whether of
components or pads. It allows printing at 2:1 and 1:1 scale and track widths of 0.025,
0.05 and 0.075" are available together with flood-fill capability which allows wider
tracks and other large copper areas to be designed very easily. With the plotter
option, it will set you back &pound;138.

Conclusions
</h2>
<p>
The Folly Bidden program is quite good. There are a number of weaknesses, mainly
concerned with the range of shapes, track width and lack of a user-definable library
or flood-fill routine (which should be possible with the SVC), but on the whole, it
is a useful basic tool and worth getting.
</p>
<p>
I would suggest that the author does some more development, concentrating on
really useful features such as auto-routing of tracks (selection of the most efficient
way to position a track between two pads), more choice of track width, user library
facility and component overlay, as well as implementing the flood-fill facility. This
would make the program a real winner and, with most users having a TPA of about
60k, the extra&rsquo; 16k of RAM on an 80-BUS machine would be well used. Most of
these facilities are available on the Pineapple program which runs on the
memory-deficient BBC B.
