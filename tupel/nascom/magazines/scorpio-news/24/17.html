Leaving The Program
</h2>
<p>
Since a C program is run by effectively calling the main( ) function: anys it.fom
this function will cause a return to system. This will occur when the vodeforakain(,)
runs out, or if a return statement occurs in main( ), There is also usually aifanetion
supplied called exit(). This takes one argument which is nsually Ofor a-nosmel st
or non-zero for an error exit. Ses

Conclusions

I have ubviously not had space to attempt to teach anyone.to use, C:in this article
and that was never my intention. For those of you who have not yet tried out C, I
hope this little taster has whet your appetite. There are.a good number of C
compilers around at a range of prices, Probably the cheapest is HiSoft C+.+ (a
misleading title as C+ + is a slightly different language. HiSoft:is,standard-C).
HiSoft does not support. floating peint and: it compiles directly to a..COM file
without using a linker (which Lfind.a disadvantage although some. people prefer it),
but it comes with a good editor and is a good-version to start on as it is pretty much
correct and standard; There-are.also-a number of good books. on the: &lsquo;subject, but
look for recommendations as there are some.bad ones too. The ultimate definitive
book is &ldquo;The C Programming Language&rdquo; by Kernighan and- Bitchie, bat this..is
probably: a bit. heavy for beginners. wR, ren @

A couple: of yoars &lsquo;ago, I Ty was steading one of the more erudite: electronic magazines
(Elektor).and came across a series of articles onthe construction of a PC compatible
&ndash; this was sometime before Mr Sugar let loose his PC_1512s on the scene. I found
that a motherboard (PCB) was available for-about &pound;75, and-a scrounge around
produced most of the chips needed to populate it, I was even able to get-hold of a
PC keyboard and other requisite hardware at a very good price --the whole lot. cost
rather less than &pound;250, Naturally, there were conflictsin the constructional and setting
up details and even Elektor got-one.er two things wrong, Sadly, the machine didn&rsquo;t
work and it was consigned to the &ldquo;pending&rdquo; area&lsquo;of my workshop until I had the
time to do something about it! I carried. on computing with CRIM Plus and the trusty
Map-80 system. :

Then, the Amstrad PCs started the rot. After some piggy-bank rattling, my wife and
I decided to buy one of these, add 128k of memory and upgrade it with a V30 and
