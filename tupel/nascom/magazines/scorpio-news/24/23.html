The listing contains a number of conditionals such as &lsquo;IF SSA VE&rsquo; and TF&rsquo;CLOCK&rsquo;,
and a number of definitions such as &lsquo;PCTRLB&rsquo; and &lsquo;NMRREG&rsquo;. These are defined
in the EQUATES section of my BIOS. The purpose of each should be fairly obvious,
but I would be pleased to help anyone trying to implement these routines who is in
difficulty.

<h2>
More GEMPEN Modifications.
</h2>
<p>
Since I submitted the article describing modifications that I have made to GEMPEN
(PEN3.COM) and which was published in Scorpio News, Vol. 2, Issue 1, I have
carried out some more useful alterations to GEMPEN. I call the present version
PEN4.COM. The related HELP overlay is called HLP4.OVL. The extra features
of PEN4.COM over those added to PEN3.COM and described in Vol. 1, Issue 4
are:
</p>
<p>
a) The top line of the screen &lsquo;now displays the current EDIT file name, and the
current Date and time, if a system clock exists.
</p>
<p>
b) &ldquo;QH-The -QH command updates the sereen Date/Time Display if a system
clock is supported and asks whether a Date and Time &lsquo;tag&rsquo; should be inserted
at the start of file in the format:
</p>
<p>
;&gt; SAVSCRN&nbsp;.DOC 27/02/88 15:09 &lt;<br>
:&gt; .
</p>
<p>
If a Clock is not supported:by the BIOS, the Date/Time Tag must be hand-edited.
The format of the &lsquo;tag&rsquo; is such that it appears as&lsquo;a comment in a source
code file. The &ldquo;QH routine is &lsquo;called&rsquo; by the &ldquo;QW and &ldquo;QE routines so
that the operator is reminded to consider whether he wishes to tag: &lsquo;the file
being saved.
</p>
<p>
c) -QN- Now allows-four options. The prompt now displays:
</p>
<p>
Remove A)il, S)tar, B)lock, N)one&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
a) &lsquo;A&rsquo; will delete ALL &lsquo;*&rsquo; and &lsquo;\&rsquo; markers from the text.<br>
b) &lsquo;B&rsquo; will delete all &lsquo;\&rsquo; markers.<br>
c) &lsquo;S&rsquo; will delete all &lsquo;** markers.<br>
d) &lsquo;N&rsquo; will not delete either &lsquo;*&rsquo; or &lsquo;\&rsquo; markers.
</p>
<p>
The ^QN routine is called by the &ldquo;QW and &ldquo;QE commands so that the
operator is reminded to remove markers before a file is saved.
