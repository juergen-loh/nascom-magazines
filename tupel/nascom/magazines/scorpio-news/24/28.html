almost as hard and time consuming to write as the &lsquo;over the top, all bells and whistles&rsquo;
kind.

The aim with Imaging Systems is two-fold, to enter data as painlessly as possible,
and once entered, to extract it with the minimum of fuss. All the software I&rsquo;ve seen
achieves these aims, it&rsquo;s the anrount of bother attached to the tasks which annoys
me, and it&rsquo;s not the actual data entry and extraction which is usually at fault. It&rsquo;s the
way in which these are approached. There is a great tendency these days to go on
first impressions. Perhaps, the tendency has always been there, it could be as I get
older, I see it for what it is.
</p>
<p>
My point is that it&rsquo;s not first impressions which should count. But salesmen only
have a short time to impress the customer, so any impression made has to count.
Take, for instance the use of &lsquo;pull-down&rsquo; or &lsquo;pop-up&rsquo; menus in software, where a
little window appears on the screen containing commands or instructions. Fine &mdash;
nice idea. These are a salesman&rsquo;s dream, they look neat and tidy, very clear (if
properly laid out) to the prospective buyer and so make the salesman&rsquo;s job easier.
Pop-up and pull-down menus are, more often than not, coupled with the use of a
mouse, claimed as a great ergonomic tool by Xerox, who first researched.the idea.
The problem with the combination is that if the job in hand is essentially a keyboard
entry job, it means moving one hand away from the keyboard, usually the right hand,
to reach the mouse to point to the menu required. This leaves the left hand for typing.
Now I&rsquo;m a reasonably proficient typist, not a normal feature amongst those who
design and write software, or for that matter those who buy (as opposed to use)
software. Now I can&rsquo;t type left handed &ndash; I need both hands&nbsp;! To me, and to many
others who can type, and many others who use computers seriously, the mouse is
an absolute pain. It slows things. up. Sometimes, only too rarely, the mouse
commands are supplemented by a set of keyboard commands, so the hands don&rsquo;t
leave the keyboard. But then, if keyboard commands are provided as well, why
bother with the mouse in the first place&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Xerox weren&rsquo;t wrong in their research, the mouse is an
invaluable tool &ndash; when used with graphics and combinations of text and graphics. It&rsquo;s
simply that the mice have been breeding and have now spread to areas where they
shouldn&rsquo;t have.
</p>
<p>
Pop-up and pull-down menus have their bad points (they must have some
advantages when used with keyboard entry, but for the life of me, I can&rsquo;t think of
any). Because they &lsquo;pop-up&rsquo; and are supposed to appear (but never do) in an unused
area of the screen, they are invariably quite small.. This means they usually contain
only half the set of commands required and so require another menu for the rest,
or if they contain instructions, they go on endlessly. The guy who designs them tends
to ensure they overlay each other, always slightly to the right and down from the
previous one. This is supposed to represent a pile of pages on a desk. So you can
