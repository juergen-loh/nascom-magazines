<p>
In this case a structure type called obj refers to a pair of integers xy (the
co-ordinates), a character obj_type (the type of object) and a short integer rotation
(the direction of the object). Now we can define variables of type &ldquo;struct obj&rdquo;, or
pointers to such astructure etc.

<p>
Unions are similar to structures except that all items are at the same place and thus
only one item is valid at a time. The main use of unions is for shared allocation of
data: to: teduee overall memory usage.
</p>
<p>
Arays oftanytype ate allowed: &lsquo;using square brackets (&ldquo;[&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;]&rdquo;) around the index.
Multi-dimension arrays use multiple brackets. For example: .
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%">
char array_of_chars[16];<br>
int two_dimensional_array[10][10];
</p>
<p>
The &lsquo;name of an array so defined translates as simply a constant of type
pointer_to_element_type, so array_of_chars above is a constant character pointer
(written as &ldquo;char * array_of_chars&rdquo;) whose value is the address of the start of the
array. This fact is not important for the use of arrays, but it does mean that a variable
ofa pointer type can be used to Point to the base of an array, for example:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%">
char * string: /* define variable:string as a character pointer */<br>
if ( string[4] = =&rsquo;h&rsquo; ) do _something( ); /* test the fifth character */
</p>
<p>
There i is no string type in C:A String? is stored i in-an&lsquo;array of chars, usually terminated
by a NULL. Constant strings ve n be etitered, e. 8:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%">
printf ("Hello World&rdquo; );
</p>
<p>
However, the string here evaluates to a constant of type &ldquo;pointer to char&rdquo; which is
the address of an area of memory containing the twelve bytes (including a
terminating NULL). Consequently a statement suchas &mdash;-
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5%">
if (input_string = = &ldquo;YES&rdquo; ).....
</p>
<p>
makes no sense at all in C. The way round this is to use one of the standard functions
supplied in the library.
