Upgrading aGM813to 256K by W.H. Turner
Introduction
</p>
<p>
This article describes how to add more memory to &laquo; Gemini GHB13 CPU board
and what to do with it.
</p>
<p>
There was not a single good
Gemini Galaxy 2 computert&rdquo;
possibility of using it for
Eache (as in CP/M Plus), and the pos
processor), that made me do it.

Whstever the season, the additional nenocy boarde looked vary expengive end

replacing the existing 6ek bit RAMs on the processor with 256K Dit RAMS
that T began to look at the problem more seriously.
</p>
<p>
For a long time I proceastinated, believing that if T attempted even minor
surgery on the processor board I could end up with a very dead computer.
ually 1 took &laquo; firm grip on myself and removed the GHE13 board from the
computer to look at the possibilities, besides at that point T had already
Bought the 256k bit chips! Looking at &lsquo;the board and the circuit diagram

Suddenly stopped working then I would only have to check the changes performed
in the Last stage, looking for pine not inverted in sockets, dry jointe, solder
bridges etc. Further T would not cut any tracks ao everything could hopefully
be returned to its original state if necessary.
