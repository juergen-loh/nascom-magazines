Colour Display
</p>
<p>
Having used a monochrome Gemini system for many
be Little ono benefit in having &laquo; colour display a far ee most progrt
concerned. &ldquo;I have now changed ay mind, I think!&rdquo; The reason for ay hesi
is&rsquo;thae whilee I&rsquo;am very impressed by different po
</p>
<p>
certain programs being ia different colours, without
</p>
<p>
too L can&rsquo;t definitely say that it te a major leap forvard.
the definite impression that 1t may be. How&rsquo;s that for &laquo; definitive statement!
</p>
<p>
Im Dave Hunt&rsquo;s bit, elsewhere in this issue, he goes on about selecting
on{tor with 0.26mm dot pitch. Well, according to the manual, my monitor has &laquo;
Or3imm dot pitch, which doesn&rsquo;t seem much bigger to me. and yet, Looking at
Charactere on bie ecreen, and those on mine, mine are much chunkier. We didn&rsquo;t
jet chance to plug his &pound;GA into my monitor and vice versa, but I suspect that
feerent Bods aust have slightly different character sets, and that Dave&rsquo;s has
jor narrower ones. Which ie better for long term use I obviously don&rsquo;t know,
</p>
<p>
it it looks to me that this ie possibly yet another parameter to be taken into
account when choosing # eytteal

&lsquo;Running thi

&lsquo;elaay appear in a slightly different place. " This wae not

Rot yet noticed thts problem with any other softw
that they acknowledge that they have seen it, and if T ever have any funnies
with anyehing else I&rsquo;ll be straight back to seo them. Meanvhile T have decided
to assume that the demo program was written very specifically for that specific
BGA, and che: specific quirk that makes {t do a slight funny on ay
specific type of ECA!

For the moment T think I&rsquo;ll live

Finally, the display on my monitor is not
fuch out, but when { mentioned it to Elo:

Summary
</p>
<p>
For A very reasonably priced system, to a very good specification. Well
&lsquo;esigned. for Mdnown&rdquo; deve santecturece Concept 200K
</p>
<p>
by copai. Anpears to be very &ldquo;compatible. Good feel. (in
By opinion) to keybourd. Very feat for the price,
</p>
<p>
Againet Maybe I vas unlucky, but apparent Quality Control let down on main
board, key-suitch/reset switch assembly, missing screw, monitor alignment.
Posetble potential problem with EGA. Still won&rsquo;t run at 1OMis, O wait states
for more than a few minute
</p>
<p>
Conclusions
</p>
<p>
I think you pay your money and take your choice. You will certainly find it
digetoult to find the Specification for the
</p>
<p>
writing, anyway?)
</p>
<p>
Quite a biel
flehough thts
</p>
<p>
If you are cost conscious and interested in an AT, I do think that this has to
</p>
<p>
be on your list. &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;re not ina rush, keep ri
how T get on with ie in ehe future
