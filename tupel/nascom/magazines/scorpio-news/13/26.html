ong could try to find vomeone with MAC.COM and request hin to
for you.

<p>
the main probien, facta

<p>
For the rest of the installation, everyone will have DDT.COM, which will be
sufficient. Since there are several ways of tackling the various probli
however, 1 is useful to review the alternative &lsquo;tools&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
a) Hditore, It is necessary to carry out editing of the various LIB files
associated with 23 and the segments, and the BIOS source code as well if
available &lsquo;Since most people will have their favourite editor, there is
OE much to aay here it should be borne in mind though, that some source
Files are too Long to fit into RAM, so that editors Like ED or Wordetar
</p>
<p>
ight be needed. (Minor changes can be made with # disk editor like
SPLCOM, which can be quicker and eneier than ueing an editor.)
</p>
<p>
&gt;) Assemblers, If MAC.COM is available, then che problems referred to above
wHt"noe&rsquo; appear, I Th (ey of MBO and L00 will permit the utilities
fo be freely altered.
</p>
<p>
DDT.COM, ZS1D.COM, 28.COM (PD), GEMDEBUG.COM. The main
age of DDT and 251D is that they can &ldquo;LOAD &ldquo;HEX files. Loading BEX
Files under Db? or ZSID is nor difficult, but error prone due co the need
</p>
<p>
T&rsquo;nuch prefer to overlay using GEMDEBUG. &ldquo;The
Latter {0 not so sophisticated as DOT or 25ID, but has a much better screen
Leplay, command structure and several other useful feature!

4) Loading Urilities. If LOAD.COM is used to load MEX files, the results are
not exactly useful, when che target address ie in high RAMI. If
MLOAD25.cOM (PD) is &lsquo;available, then it te easier to MLOAD the HEX file,
and to use the reqult ae an overlay of 23 segment. For example, assume
that the 2k Byte 23 CCP is co reside at C000H, as in ay current systen.
After aseenbly of Z0PHS ASH LEMLOAD Le applfed to ECPRS-HEX, T am Left
with a disk file 2K long, with addresses loaded for C800H, that can then
</p>
<p>
Aly be used as an overlay.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo; a number of byt
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;of a Eile of diak sector, which
teacks, or directory data. DU.COM (PD) in one of its many versions is also
very versatile, but I find SPZ a0 much pleasanter to use. (A version of DU
Accompantes 23, and de fe more Interactive than earlier versions.
</p>
<p>
&pound;) Other UeLLdtten, One of the several PD utilities auch ev BDOSLOC, FINDCCT,
LOCATE, 23100 to discover the operating CP/M syater &lsquo;makes 1 much
farler&rsquo; to find out about syecon addriesen. eepecially if the installer it
Rot used to system work.

once it has been decided which 23 segments and buffere will be implemented,

tion information supplied
sare preset to all 00&rsquo;s. The main
for this is to avoid system problems that could occur after the system is
booted, if spurious data is left in any of the system buffers,
