Pluto 2 is To&rsquo;s best seller. Still an 80-BUS compatible boerd, it has grom to
12"&rsquo;g gr to contain all of the electronica. Tt retaine the saue 6080. procetsor
and RS232 interface as Pluto 1A, but includes s12K of memory (optionally 1M},
es Racdwave pan and soom, 236 colour froma paietve oF Le? MILLION (1), and
optional veal ime frame grabber. This latter option is very impressive, a&reg; YoU
Would believe that the colour camera vas connected directly to the&rsquo; colssr
Honitor, not going into and out of Pluto&rsquo;s memory, &ldquo;pricing is equally
impressive!

</p>
<p>
being able to display 256 colours at # time on the screen is a severe
</p>
<p>
fmfeaion to many people. At that level it len&rsquo;t possible to have very sqooth
shading from one colour co another, and therefore subtle toning and other such
sf fects are just not possible. Io therefore sell a system based on three Pluto
2 boards synchronived together. This means that any screen pixel can be any of
the 16.7 MILLION coloure available.
