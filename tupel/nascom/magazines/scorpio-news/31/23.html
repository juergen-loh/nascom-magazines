Developing Programs On Microcomputers<br>

Paul asked me to write an epitaph, as this is the end of an era of 8-bit computing. I
thought it would be interesting to look back at the changes in ways of developing
software on microcomputers, concentrating on the 80-BUS machines. I am sure
some of you will have feelings of nostalgia when you read this!
</p>
<p>
The first program I wrote for my Nascom&nbsp;1 (in 1978 I think) was written out in pencil
on pieces of paper, with assembler mnemonics on the right which I had learned from
the Z80 CPU manual. I then hand assembled the program, looking up each
instruction in turn. Calculating the jumps was a painful process, particularly the
backward relative ones. When the program was typed in (in hex) and executed, it
crashed. I had no clues, and the next stage was to single step the program until the
problem was found. Naturally the bug involved a missing instruction which meant
that every jump had to be recalculated and typed in again. Still, the program worked
in the end,

Once ZEAP was available, which provided a text editor and an assembler, things
were much better. It was not possible for me to assemble a whole 2K of object code,
and this time it was NAS-SYS that I was writing. This code was particularly hard
and slow to debug, because I could only test it by putting it into EPROM, turning
off the machine, plugging in the chips, and turning it on again. If it didn&rsquo;t work the
only way to debug was by a minute examination of all the changes since the previous
version.

The next great leap forward was floppy disks and CP/M. The MicroSoft M80
assembler was an excellent product, and WordStar was a fast text editor. In fact only
recently has WordStar been made to run as fast on a PC as it used to under CP/M.
I wrote another ROM based operating system, RP/M, using these tools.
</p>
<p>
I made several attempts to get away from Z80 assembler and wasted some effort on
a language called PL/M. Then good C compilers were developed and I wrote a
communications program called DIAL in a mixture of C and assembler.
</p>

Then the years passed and I had very little free time. I used IBM&nbsp;PCs and had a
Compaq Plus followed by a Toshiba 3100 at home, but have written very few
programs. Recently I tried out the latest MicroSoft products consisting of MicroSoft
C5.1, Codeview, Quick C, and MASM 5.1. These are a very professional set of tools
