Well, not really free, but if you have a GM888 8088 board and RAM in excess of 64
Kbytes, then my program will enable you to use the memory above 0FFFF as a
RAM-Disk. The principle of operation is very simple. The program runs and sets
up alternative entry points to SELDRV, READ, WRITE and WBOOT. The code
at these alternative entry points checks to see if the drive is &ldquo;M&rdquo;, if so it calls the
8088 to move sectors of 128 bytes into the appropriate section of RAM. If not,
execution is passed to the original code for these functions. It is an example of
&ldquo;Co-operating Code&rdquo;, as mentioned in the GM888 manual, from which the
change-over code was borrowed. Please do not look too carefully at the 8088 code,
this was my first attempt at writing 8088 pseudo assembler, and I now realise that
improvements could be made. However, THIS WORKS.
</p>
<p>
A copy of the CCP and BDOS is stored in RAM, and this version is loaded when
&ldquo; C&rdquo; is typed, reducing the time taken to perform a warm boot and eliminating for
ever the message &ldquo;Wrong system on this disk&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
After &ldquo;GENS YS-ing&rdquo; my system, I am told that the system ends at BIOS +OFO0A
(FFOA) and the new code is therefore assembled to reside there. If, because of a
different disk system, your end is higher than that, it will be necessary to alter
BIOSEND, up to a maximum of FF31. If BIOSEND is above that the the reservation
of another page of workspace will be necessary. Please check the values between
BIOS V3.2 (or BIOS V3.5) and ENDIF very carefully for your system. WBOOTUSE
is the length of the original wboot code which reads in the CCP and BDOS from
disk, DRIVE, SECTOR, TRACK and DMAADR are the stores accessed by the
SELDRV, SETSEC, SETTRK and SETDMA commands respectively. DIRBUF
is the directory buffer used by all the disk directories, and can be found by examining
the SELDRV command. If anyone is unsure of the positions of these areas, or would
like a copy of this program on disk, they are welcome to contact me via this magazine.
</p>
<p>
The CCP and BDOS live at 1000:0000 to 1000:15FF with the 8088 code at 1000:1FE6,
the directory at 1000:2000 to 1000:2FFF, and the data areas contiguously up from
there. It is thus possible to look at files in the RAM-disk using DDT86, but because
the disk is &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; it can also be inspected and unerased by a disk doctor
program such as DU.
</p>
<p>
I hope that the code, which is available by contacting me, is self explanatory and
adequately commented.
