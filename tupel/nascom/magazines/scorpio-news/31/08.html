Hair on End!
</h2>
<p>
I am sorry that Scorpio News is ceasing &ndash; there are too few of us hackers (and I use
the word in its original sense) left. Byte has recently discontinued Steve Ciarcia, and
is now edited entirely by what I consider to be cretins who wouldn&rsquo;t know which end
of the soldering iron was hot!
</p>
<p>
Having seen the development of the 80-BUS system, and the (few) mistakes made,
it is illuminating to consider the absolute mess IBM and their designers have made
of the PC hardware. I have some friends involved in interrupt processing on PCs &mdash;
the problems would make one&rsquo;s hair stand on end! Interrupts are not latched and
so must be serviced within 5uS or less. An EGA scrolling can lock out interrupts for
over 8uS (more on an AT), with consequent disaster! If interrupts are important,
one can&rsquo;t beat the Z80 family!
</p>
<p>
I would be glad to meet with any 80-BUS fanatics visiting my area.

Goodbye! Thanks for all the fish (and many years of interesting and useful
information). Best wishes to you all for the future.
