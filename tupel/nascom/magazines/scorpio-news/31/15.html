<i>&ldquo;We&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>, this is getting sillier, did that mean there&rsquo;s more of them somewhere. I could
see nothing. It was dark all round, just a circle of light, and the insect on the floor.
Parallel ridges ran across the floor into the darkness. Desperately I tried to think
how I got into this situation,
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Sure, there&rsquo;s lots of us in the organisation. Do you want to meet a few us&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i> There
was a shuffling in the shadows all round. The sound of hundreds of small feet. An
absurd thought occurred, if they all have sixteen legs and each leg has a boot on the
end, there must be a lot of work for the cobblers around here.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Cobblers to you to mate. Do you want to meet us or not&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Ok, I suppose it can&rsquo;t do any harm. Do you all have names &ndash; numbers, I mean&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Well, some of us have a few letters thrown in as well. Take this one for instance.&rdquo;</i> The
shuffling grew louder, and a larger insect came into the light. I counted, 40 legs in
all, and again the little black boots. Why the boots&nbsp;? <i>&ldquo;He calls himself Z80.&rdquo;</i>, and
then in a whisper, <i>&ldquo;He thinks he&rsquo;s the boss round here. But he&rsquo;d be no good without
me and my mates. He&rsquo;s getting on a bit as weil.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;How do you do&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>, the cultured Californian voice said, <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Z80, I&rsquo;m unique. I see
you&rsquo;ve been talking to my small friend here.&rdquo;</i> It looked down on 4116, and with a
shuffling of the legs, several boots landed under 4116 and swiftly kicked him out of
the light. <i>&ldquo;Please excuse these underlings, I&rsquo;d have been here to greet you myself had
I not had an enemeye in progress at the time.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;An enemy&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i> I asked.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;No, an enemeye, you know, a fella&rsquo;s got to do what a fella&rsquo;s gotta do. No interrupting
an enemeye, but then you should know that.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;I should&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i> Again the feeling of &lsquo;deja vu&rsquo;. Why should I know what an enemeye is.
Somewhere in the back of my mind enemeye seemed to mean something &ndash; but what&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Never mind&rdquo;</i> said Z80, dismissing the subject, <i>&ldquo;4s you may be aware, I&rsquo;m the
organiser around here. I keep the others in order and tell them what to do. They ail
seem to think it&rsquo;s easy, but dolling out instructions at about 300,000 a second really
puts a strain on one&rsquo;s silicon, if you know what I mean.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t, where the hell am I&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t know&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i> asked Z80, sounding pained with muted surprise, <i>&ldquo;I would
have thought it was all too obvious.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
