<i>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not helpful. And you might not have noticed, but I don&rsquo;t seem to be on the
same scale as you. There&rsquo;s me up here and there&rsquo;s you down there at my feet.&rdquo;</i> Feet
again&nbsp;! Perhaps I&rsquo;m developing a feet fixation. <i>&ldquo;Do you think you could explain in
words of half a syllable or less. WHERE THE HELL AM I&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;In Nascomland of course. We live here, and you arrived out of the blue as it were.
And as to scale, you really should be more careful. I hear you did a severe damage to
poor 7432. What had he done to hurt you&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about 7432, I didn&rsquo;t know. I hope any damage I&rsquo;ve done can be mended.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Oh I dare say.&rdquo;</i>, said Z80, <i>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to my esseyeoe any more, but he was boring
anyway, so I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m too upset about it. But you&rsquo;d better keep it quiet, if some of
the others get to hear of it, they won&rsquo;t be too pleased. Could get nasty.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
I looked about, still nothing but shuffling in the darkness, but the shuffling took on
a new menace. Are feet menacing&nbsp;? <i>&ldquo;Tell me, Z80, where is Nascomland&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>, l asked
as politely as I could.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</i> said Z80 glibly. <i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been watching you for years. You entered our galaxy
as @ speck some time ago, and for a while we thought you&rsquo;d miss us entirely, but here
you are and you&rsquo;ve landed. Don&rsquo;t you know where you came from&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;I confess I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</i>, I said, <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to remember anything before I arrived
here, although some of the things I&rsquo;ve seen and heard seem familiar. Can I ask you a
question&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Seems to me you haven&rsquo;t stopped asking questions, but go ahead anyway.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
This was going to be a major intellectual exercise, even before I asked, I knew it
would upset him. <i>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re well endowed with boots.&rdquo;</i> Why did I ask that, feet
again. I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;What of it.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
This was bad. Why boots, if he&rsquo;s got legs, it follows he&rsquo;s got boots. There I go again
&ndash; no stop, <i>&ldquo;Tell me, how do you tie up all those boot laces&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i> Oh hell, this isn&rsquo;t going
right, I&rsquo;ve upset him, he&rsquo;s changing colour.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;I am shocked. Truly shocked.&rdquo;</i> From the tone, I could see he was having difficulty
keeping control. <i>&ldquo;You come here uninvited. You tread on a valued friend and
colleague. You &ndash; you behave like an imbecile &ndash; and &ndash; and now you insult my boots.
What&rsquo;s wrong with you. Is all you think about is boots, why boots, what&rsquo;s wrong with
my boots, there lovely boots. I&rsquo;m not staying here to be insulted.&rdquo;</i> By now he was
glowing a dull red. With a sudden scurrying movement, he shot off into the darkness.
