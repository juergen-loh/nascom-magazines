without having co remember on which DU: I have decided to put thinge-type
an H, and see the RCP commands displayed, Type &raquo; P xxex, and get a 256 byte
Hex and ASCTT dump from address wexx Try 4 fow PORE commands, and use P to see
the result, (Don&rsquo;t poke the Operating system unless you know what you are
Going)

Benchmark Update by P.D. Coker
</p>
<p>
Since carrying out the series of benchmarks which were published in Scorpio News
Vi&rsquo;Th (Jan-Mar. 1987), I have acquired one or two more compilers and
Interpreters which T&rsquo;ve cried out on a Genial Multiboard system fitted with the
GHeGe processor, under CP/H-00 (2.2) and CP/M-86, as appropriate. For purposes
fof comparison, i ran the same benchmark on an Amstrad PCLS12 using MSDOS and DOS
Plus = the latter enables one to run CP/M-86 prog:
</p>
<p>
The results are quite interesting The benchmark used was obtained from Dr
Dobbs Journal in which the iden was to produce a result ms near to 2500 a5
possible, using a range of intrinsic furctiont available in the interpreter oF
Poaptler
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The Following language implementations were availabl
Nevada Fortran (2t0, cP/m 80)
Utah Foreren sp0s)
ProForeran (Cb/M-86 and DOS Plus)
Biceosofe Fortran-77 (MSD0S)
BaSrCus v. 5.28 &laquo;spos)
Bastces v. 3.21, (Dos. Plus)
Guaasic s00s)
</p>
<p>
The Fortran versions were all compiled and the BASIC# were all interpreted.
The Amstrad usea the 8086 16 bit CPU with &laquo; system clock frequency of SHir
while the M888 uses the 8088 6/16 bit CPU at Mie with I/O via the aMiE 80-
Bus

The resulte were as follows:
