4t7 The magazine specs of machines are confusing. the prices seem to vary by
shout 25r&rsquo;fer ensentiaiiy the sane things, and Jf you want to actually ten one
and try t out for an hour of twa, you ery and find someone who will actually
&lsquo;how you one BEFORE you hand ower &lsquo;the money.

<p>
I even tried a couple of the proprietary computer shops, who did know somethis
about business software, but ware amazed that T actually wanted a machine o
thie sort to actually USE. They Knew naff all sbout what actually went on
inside the machine; one lot wece adamant chat the processor inside an AT wai
actually an B08 be TBM compatible?

Just after Christman there was a very twee but informative Channel 4 programme

Despite che high speed of this machine, 10HHs clock speed with sero wait states

55m latency on the 20M byte disk drive, I&rsquo;ve hed only one problem with
software. The age are all guttering about these high speed, so called &ldquo;Turbo&rdquo;
jchines having problems with certain software, I&rsquo;va only found one and that

Bring the ehing down to normal speed because there seemed to be some hardware

(TIL be up-loading that to CBBSLY &lsquo;shorely), my radio log book has been
rewritten from end to end, and for fun and the practice, I&rsquo;ve tried to
Assemble CRCKS into 8086 code without # lot of auccess, using the B0T086 progea

and. then hacking from there, Funny, I can only find an HS-D0S version of

Inclede Clone info?

<p>
Somewhere else in this mag, you&rsquo;ll find a letter from me suggesting an IBM spot
in future issues. I&rsquo;ve no idea how that will go down. bur if it&rsquo;s well
received, it&rsquo;ll certainly give me lote of scope for writing about the

Aegiance, T note that NASTUG, that
Bastion of che recently
changed eaphaed still supporting Nascom/Gemini/Map, &lsquo;recently had
secting to decide the future of the club They recognize that &laquo; majority of the
becehip now use different machines although they aiso elected to reeain the
NASTUc. The venue haw aleo changed and the club has been put on to &laquo; more
Substantial Eooting with an actual published programme!&rdquo; They now meet on
Alternate Thuredaye at the Crown _ ______, ______ ____, Uxbridge. For further
