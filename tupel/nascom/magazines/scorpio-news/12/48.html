7) Finally double check all the wiring for any mistal

Re-install the FDC card into your system and reconnect the drive cabling. Power
up and boot up in your normel disk operating system Everything should work as
before, 1f not check the voltege Level on 1c5 pin 15 which should be low. IF
rhis ie ok then check that the two clock lines are not svapped. I had 10
problems, everything worked first time when 1 booted up the disk system,

<p>
&lsquo;THE SOFTWARE
</p>
<p>
Modifying existing software should be quite straight forward. Changes only need
to be made whenever commands that (potentially) move the disk drive&rsquo;s head are
iseued eo the Wp1797 disk controller chip. I include details of 2 versions of
software, one where peisitive disk coutines communicate directly with the MD1797
Foc chip and secondly where the routines communicate Indirectly via s single
call (1&rsquo;e SYS users)
</p>
<p>
Firstly, for routines that send commands to FDC directly, 11st{og 1 shows the
raggested alterations (in lower case) to the existing code &ldquo;The existing code is
presented in a hypothetical form, and you may have to alter it slightly in Light
SF your own circumstances. The &ldquo;FDCHUB?&rdquo; aubroueine call nay in fact be 9 jump
fo tome common code shared by &ldquo;HOME:&rdquo;, "SEEK:&rdquo; and aaybe other routiner as well.
In this case Just append the source of the &lsquo;stepsiow-&rsquo; at the end for your
fepeBusy&rsquo; routine
