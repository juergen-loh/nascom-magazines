&lsquo;The commands enabled in my system RCP are DIR, REN, TYPE and LIST (Send file to
Printer). I cam also fit in Peek, POKE, PROT, REG, REN, WHL and WiILQ
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The CP command allows file copying. It allows renaming during copying but it
doer not perform &laquo;Verify. T like to alvays verify copies, so use utility
Like MooPY, FILER&rsquo; or NSWP.
</p>
<p>
The Preck commend will dteplay 256 HEX and ASCIT bytes from che given address,
and the POKE command allows bytes to be changed using either HEX of ASCII.

<p>
PROT allows file attribute bits to be set/reset, eg. SYS/DIR RO/RW.

WuLQ enables the state of the &lsquo;Wheel Byte&rsquo; to be examined, and WHL permits it to
be SET or RESET The Vheel Byte is a system security device. Any or ALL CCP
and RCP commands may be set to check the Wheel Byte before proceeding Thus
Certain commands might be permitted, but others barred. Ona Remote Access
System, the wheel Byte can prevent sere from Vandalicing&rsquo; the system Acces
to other divectories. dives, etc, can be barred

If the user types an M, whilst at system Level, the commands enabled in the
Current RCP will be displayed Note that several of the commands provided In
the RCP are also available as command files, which eases the problem of deciding
which commands to include of omit from the RCP

&lsquo;A description of the ZCPRS Segments and Buffers
</p>
<p>
CP/M 22 can be &ldquo;moved&rdquo; in 1k unite via MOVCPM in the ordinary way. By altering
a byte within MOVCPM hovever, moves as omall ae 100h bytes are poscible This
fe described in more detail in the natallation part of thie article. Thug once
the decision to resite CP/M is made, at least another 256 bytes are added oF
</p>
<p>
If the additional software that caused the need to move CP/M down does not need.
ali of these bytes, it ia just as well to use them for something else, a2 to
Waste them. 50 if for example it is decided to implement the External YCB and
this needs more space above CP/M, then the message buffers and shell stack
become possible as well at no extrs cost in memory

xternal CCP Stack.
</p>
<p>
In order to &lsquo;cram&rsquo; as many commands as possible into the COP, the user has the
option of placing the CCP stack inside of outeide of the CCP memory area,&rdquo; This
iS especially Important with 22, where there se no extension of the CCP (RCE
Segment) Te External Stack area occupies 30H bytes, if enabled, which 13

Standard CP/M allows only one command per Line of input. It is possible to get
around this to some extent by using extended comand processing, ie. Submit
