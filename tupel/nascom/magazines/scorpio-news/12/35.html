Now one thing I have found about owning an IBM clone ie that the amount of
Anformacion which comes with it is minimal (Like 10 pages of manual describing,
in bad English, what the various Linke do). I need information, and one place T
won&rsquo;t find it is here! Ae most of those afore-mentioned &lsquo;mature&rsquo; micro users
which I know personally are in similar position end. already have various
breeds of TEM clone (ranging from Ying Tong Tiddie-I-Po nasties, through Amstrad
2512&rsquo;s to quite good Japanese AT clones) and all suffer from the same lack of
inforaation, might ot a sali section on TAM clones be ineeresting? Afcer all
they share derivatives of the same processor used in the CMSs 8083 card and a
Small (readable) secies on 6088/8086 assembler would be very useful,
particularly about the seguent registers which ineist on inventing funny numbers
BLL of their own when I try something other than the sost mundane assembler

Partial Defection
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I wish Scorpio News well and hope that Lt can Find a way of maintaining interest
in&rsquo;B-bit Z80 CP/M technology in the face of severe and ever increasing
competition from &pound;84 look-r-1ike michines. The development of a conversion path
for usere when they upgrade their home computing systems to that tert and data
Eller can be readily passed from from one type of machine to another
</p>
<p>
Tam obtaining a 16-bit MS-DOS machine but till intend to run a Nascom&nbsp;2 based
GeyH machine into the foreseesble future simply because 1 have 3 years of
experience and understand the system very well hen performing specialized
tasks Other users of older microcomputers are probably in #. sia!
</p>
<p>
Ineed che large storage capacity of &laquo; modern wicro, but not many of its more
advanced features

Dear sir,
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Thank you for the first edition of Scorpio News with which I was very impressed.
Tam looking forward to the complete article on disk formats and 1f you have in
mind an introduction to Pascel (along the lines of the Fortran article), that
foo would be great
</p>
<p>
Having been forced to submit to the dreaded PC to be compatible with other poor
unfortunates, I (along with some of your contributors) am of the view that the
Fest of the world knows not vhat they have missed My Nacom and Galaxy syst
</p>
<p>
get much more use simply decause they can get through considerably more work
S&rsquo;given time. How about ercicles where the combination of 60-BUS and PCe can be
Used to advantage: for example, downloading prograns and instructions from a PC
fo an 60-BUS which looks after various contral functions and reporte statue back
ta the PCr
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I have done something similar between the Galaxy and Nascom in
which the Galaxy boots the Nascom through the terial interface, having first
Touded ie with # program to f1i1 the NASPEN text spece of memory with data sent
</p>
<p>
Gown the RS232 The Nagcom then acts as an editable (using ROM based NASPEN)
