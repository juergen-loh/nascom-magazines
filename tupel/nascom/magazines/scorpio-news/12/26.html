The above example may appear trivial, but the concept can be extremely useful in

<p>
&lsquo;The Input/Output Segment.
</p>
<p>
this segment is optional, and its size 4 dependent on what facilities the user
hae included. In the memory map Fig-t, it ty shown as being 1 3x bytes Long
Since this segment is hardware specific, it becomer the responsibility of the
user to weite this software, An example source file for an IOP is provided, to
show how it may be done Since I have only one Screen and Printer, and have no

The Wheel Byte.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this Byte has been described shove. It is Just a one byte
location, allocated somewhere in memory, In 22, address OOSBH was used In 23,
the author has switched to OOM3H in the documentation, but has aot explained the
reason for the move. Since this would restrict the External Fath length, 1 have
Tete che Byte at COIBH The byte may be examined, set OF reset ae described
above, and 4 orility to manipclate it is alse provided,

&lsquo;The Maternal Path
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The path may be made internal to the CCP, but would then disappear when progr
are loaded, The author chose fo use locations from 000M in beth 22 and&rsquo; 23y
this Seems reasonable The path Tong ag one Likes, hue is in reality
Festricted by the memory space available for it from 0040H, and the fact that
the longer it is, the longer a search takes, especially when one has type
&lsquo;dud&rsquo; Cite name. &ldquo;23 can be eesembled to minimize the path so chat Locations
that appear more than ence are only searched once. The current drive and weer
are ALWAYS searched first anyway, s0 do not appear in the path. on ay system T
Currently search up to seven locations after the current DU. They are:

There are too many 23 utilities to describe more then a few in any detail. ALL
of them are designed to work with 23, although some Will run on standard OP/M.
Many of them read the ENV segment and make use of the screen facilities defined
thece, cesulting in an improved display,
</p>
<p>
Many also make use of the various buffere and stacks described above
</p>
<p>
In other words 23 and its command utilities are an integrated Together
thoy fore remarkable systes, 23 without its utilities ty still good Many of
che 23 utilities will not work on a non-23 system. They fail into several
natura! groups, depending on the function,

Copying &ndash;

<p>
MCOPY is appropriate when multiple copies or complex stcings of commands are
Fequiced. &lsquo;Ie copies files from any DIR/DU to any other (Including users between
1e"and 21), verifying the copy and reporting erfore. Te will perfora multiple
