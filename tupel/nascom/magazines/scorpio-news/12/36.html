DOS? Bug
Dear Sir.
</p>
<p>
The Last (ciret) Lesue of this magazine featured an article by Kr c Bowden on
Iaproving the user interface to CP/M. In thie article He Bowden stated that he
had found s bug in BDOSZ. As co-author of Bbos2 I feel duty bound to mention
the following facts and throw users &laquo; Lifeline,
</p>
<p>
Mr Bowden was correct in what he said when referring to the switching between
and 16 bit directory entries under BDGS?. However, this bug was fixed in
Version 1.3 and I suspect that Mr Sowden has an old copy of S60S2. Users of
BOS &lsquo;with a version mumber of Less than 1.7 should also note that there vere a
couple of bugs in the Read and Write Random routiner Admiteedly, these vere
Somewhat obscure and haven&rsquo;t been reported to me through the dealer chein but
Feel duty Dound co mencion them Aas far ag I&rsquo;m aware, chere are few progr
that are affected by the last two buge, but I do know that the Library Ueility
{LUCOH) can come to grief as it uses random reade and vrites. The curcent
version Of 8D0SZ is Ld and features special nendling of the IX sad TY
Fegistere, for users who have a10Ss that use these registers, and a totally re-written
error handler to impcove compatibility with the DRY 8008
</p>
<p>
Armed with a copy of this magazine I am hopeful that users wishing to upgrade
Wilt be able to take their distribution disk to their friendly 60-BUS 4
</p>
<p>
Obeain version 18 for nothing more than # nominal copying fee&rdquo; Failing ehie T
should be pleased to provide this service All 1 would require is the original
Boos? disceibucion ditk, together with either UK postage stamps to cover postage
Or a cheque made out to ne to cover the cost of postage (you should know how
fuch &lsquo;vo enclose since you are sendang the disk to me)&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t forget to enclose
Jour name and addvess and please allow 26 days for delivery (1 may need it if
there se a rush)
</p>
<p>
My thanks co the Editor for publishing this Letcer and, of course, thanks for
Providing ue s0-aUS addicts with an excellent magozine. &ldquo;There are some of
St Tease, who would pay almost any price for s quality 80-BUS magazine 1ike
this, and there were those of us who would have ateempted to start our own
(Chris &ldquo;De Dark! Blackmore for instance) 1f Paul had not done #0.
