Short and to the point
Dear siz,
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for Scorpio News Vol 1 Is@ 1 received yesterday. May T
congratulate you on an excellent product in the best, teaditions of INMC, INMC-80
&lsquo;and&rsquo;80-3US News, all of which T fave avidly read and re-read?
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, c.c Woodford, Torquay, Devon.

cemini &ndash; what&rsquo;s going on?
</p>
<p>
Deer Sir,
</p>
<p>
Dave Hunt&rsquo;s comments about IBM compatibles in the first issue of Scorpio News
ace cinely, to say the least. &ldquo;what a pty that Gemin{ didart exploit the
potential of che 80-BUS vo produce a card that would run MSDOS programs and
Braphice It&rsquo;s too late now and rome 60-BUS users will have purchased
(depending upon their finencial state) one of the PC clones that are widely
available at present, in spite of the reported lack of
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we have been spoilt by receiving good tervice Fro
Companies supplying S0-8US in the pase but Tam Teft with the Lapri
even this is declining fast &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all rather sad
</p>
<p>
Gemini, in spite of promises, don&rsquo;t appear to have produced any information on
new 80-BUS products or even &amp; price List recently and Lucas &ndash; well. I asked
them if T could have copies of the circuit diagrams for the RAM A and Buffer
boscds (really up co date stuff, this!) and was politely told that due to
Company policy and copyright laws, they do not eaue circuit drawings. How
pathetici Gemini don&rsquo;t appear to answer letters these days &ndash; perhaps they are
Eli benvering away on the Challenger. I (and many others) would be very
Interested to know what tew boards are available for 60-808, and the
Advertisements from Map 80, EV Computing and Newbucn in tho first Scorpio Neve
Were most helpful = and Kenilworth Computert are amongst the most courteous and
helpful of deelers
</p>
<p>
Sealy, one hay to forget about any significant kelp or new offerings from Lucas
For the Nascom, &lsquo;but Tam less viiling to accept thac Gemini have gone down the
path. Serhape 1am being naive but the 80-BUS (and the 760) are by no
Reans obsolete one of my machines, vith the aid of some excellent roftware
from Map 80, tx currently being used to transfer all sorts of voftware between
</p>
<p>
different disk formats for doth aicros and mini-computers. Wo other
nanufacturer has anything even remotely approaching the versatility of this oF
the Gemini MP8 or Mike York&rsquo;s All-dizk systens Dave Hunt mentioned the
</p>
<p>
excellent Gemini modem card &ndash; and there are the Pluto boards from Lo Recearch
Waich have become # de facto industty standard (I&rsquo;d like one of those but the
piggy Dank won&rsquo;t stand it nov I&rsquo;ve bought an Amstrad PC15121) The quality of
Ehe customised B10Ss for CP/M 27 and Plus are outstanding compared with the
feeble offerings for ovher machines, thanks to the efforts of Mesart Beal,
Parkiseon and Watkins, to nention Just a few conecibucore
</p>
<p>
There&rsquo;s no point in moaning about the lack of information from Gemini or Lucas&rsquo;s
peculiar company policies unless one ir prepared to do something about it. Lots
Of polite Jetters from users of B0-BUS products to Mr Marshall might persuade
Bim to tevenl the goodies which ve were assured were to come from Gemini In
spport of S0-BUS &copy; possibly in the form of an insert to Scorpio News Lucas
are probably beyond ope, but T intend writing to Mr Marmion, the sales
Coordinator, to let him know what T think (politely, of course) of company
policy!
