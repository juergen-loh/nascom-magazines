Well ie all started back in late 1979 when I was looking for a way of sequencing
Gn analogue music synthesizer and I happened across an&rdquo; advert for &amp; Nascoa 1
The beast was Ordered and after the cuttonary long wait (while it wai designed T
think), &raquo; box of bite arrived with a promise that che power supply would be
ut &lsquo;soon {still to be designed?). Well the kit was bulit and a hone brew PSU
fabricated, Gees what? Te didn&rsquo;t work. After many hours of fiddling with
&laquo;my firet computer, I decided that che problem must be in the EPROM
(wasiue 41 ina 2708) 50 a test cig the EPROM and
Bonitor the data lines with LEDS After the Firat the
PP FP, I twigged that the EPROM was empty. It was promptly ent

real purpose for buying the beast, and who cares T vas hooked anyway

Placed in various publications and we were overvhelmed with demand At this
Btage it seemed Like @ good idea to become # Nascom dealer and I was very
flattered when I was accepted as such, when working from my lounge at home In
reniiey anyone buying produce in quantity with cash up front would have Deen

In March 1980 the company became BITS &amp; PCs Computer Products Ltd and T
resigned from the PO&rdquo; We also moved into a quaint little shop in Wetherby,
which meant that we were able to have most of the house back as Living

Our next few years saw us playing computer retailers snakes end ladders along
with all the others.&rdquo; We fared better than mort due to our policy of designing
Our own add-ons for various types of computers including Nascom, Sharp, Epson,
Superbrain, and Gemini This gave us a strong reputation among both customers
