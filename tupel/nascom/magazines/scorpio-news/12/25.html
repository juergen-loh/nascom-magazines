This area uses only 80 bytes, and the author of 23 emphasizes the need to instal
this feature if 23 is to work properly. The area is used to convey systen

Shell stack.
</p>
<p>
The ahell stack uses 126 bytes of memory. 23 supports the use of Shells, and
the Shell Stack is necessary for this feature to be used
</p>
<p>
fe admit to being unfamiliar with shells, and I quote from the 23
satation &ndash; &ldquo;A Shell is front end processor which is invoked in place of
the Z3 CCP input routine, allowing command input co proceed in a variety of
Giferent, perhaps nore user friendly ways&rdquo;. Peograns that are configured a
Shells 1ie in memory rather like the layers in an onion &ndash; one ebove the other,
Father chan replacing one another, so that control can be passed from one to the
Other Thus MENU, which is a sNell can rua another shell like VFILER When
VETLER 1 exited, control would revert to MENU

<p>
&lsquo;This segment takes up 256 bytes of memory, but is essential If the 2 system is
fo operate Tr consists of two parts, each of uhich (s allocated 128 bytes
One part describes the 23 environment itself. Tt holds the addresses of all of
the active segmente and buffers so that 23 and utilities know what is ava{lable
and where to find it, It also contains some generai date about Terminals and
Printers, such as Screen Width, Screen Lines, Printer Width, Form Feed
supported, and toon. Two terminals and four printers may be described
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The other part, called the TCAP &ndash; Terminal Capabilities, describes the special
features of the system screen handling such es Cursor Key bytes, Cursor movement
Byte string, Inverted Video Commands, Clear Screen and Line&rsquo; These are then
available tol the Z system utilities, which can then use the features for better
User interface 23 comes with s large library of Terminals described, but the
Gemini IVC/SvC is not amongst then it is quite easy to set up an ENV segment
for any terminal however. There are over 80 bytes free in this part of the&nbsp;.EW
Segment, vhich may be utilized in other ways, a8 suggested in the installation
