What it does is start with the number 1, and carry out a string of Functions on
ity which are atended to get back to the same velue they started with, i.e. 1.
Thig&rsquo;ds then increaented, and the process repeated. So, if the computer is
working to absolutely exact values in all dts calculations, the final result

Now all of these are faster than the times quoted by PD Coker in tesue 1, and
the HPS time, using that lovely floating point board, is giles faster than any
of the competition. This pleases ae inmencely &lsquo;But 7 know what you are
thinking, &ldquo;Those answers are milps outi&rdquo;. Weil, Paddy Coker did ask if anyone
could explain the apparently avful result the Hisoft Pazeals give on this
benchaark, and I&rsquo;am volunteering as 1 have done the Open University course M351,
Numerical Computation (and 1 even&rsquo; pased!).

&lsquo;The program carries out 6x2300 = 15,000 floating point calculations, one after
Another Any inaccuracy caused by the need to truncate the values to fit into
the space allocated te a real varvable will obviously mount up considerably over
Such a sequence of calculations. This tendency vo reduce slightly the value of
Gach result that will not fit in a real probably accounts for a Lirge part of
the defile

Clearly, anyone who {s stil] awake will be wondering why all the other languages
get a0 much closer to the right&rsquo; anewer &ldquo;They might feel that Tam trying
Gesperately to defend &raquo; compiler that I like, with no Justification In an
ateaupt to find out what was at the root of the matter, I asked Hisoft how their
fan and arctan functions &lsquo;worked I thought they might use a Taylor series, or
Some such idea Thad, by fiddling sbout with the oFiginal program, discovered
that almost all the inaccuracy was being created by the ten and acctan functions
OF HPL Unlike every other software firm f have ever written to, isoft

&ldquo;As you probably realise the Trig routines for the Pascal were written rather a
Yong&rsquo; time ego. I think it was in March 1961! they were originglly wratten in
Pareal and then hand coded into assembler attempting to make the cuntrolling
cade a3 tight 2s possible and with speed rather than space un mand L can&rsquo;t
actually remember viether they were written on a dick machine or on cassette
But either way the original Parcal source hes Long since disappeared. The
Slgorithne geet are mainly continuous frectione having divided the 0-90 degree
Fange into a number of sections Look at the assembler source; it doesn&rsquo;t make
hhuch sense since the only comments refer to the vartables and constants rom the
Pascal version The TAN function seems to wee two entirely separate algorithms
depending on the input value One of the constants hed Co be fudged to avoid
discontinuity which sadly leads to snaccuracy near 90 The algorithms were
developed fron # book published by HMSO in 1959 when speed of the algocithns
Gred way really &lsquo;mportant Ican&rsquo;t remenber its titie but tim pretty sure it
Involves &lsquo;digital computers&rsquo;.&rdquo;

1 would be prepared to bet that the &ldquo;inaccuracy near 90&rsquo; is the main reason for
the bad reauit PD Coker got using HPl Calculations carried out sensibly will
Bive good results, &lsquo;while 15000 floating point operations ina row on a variable
Will indicate a Silly peogram end will give silly results. All the usual
Femarks about the usefulness or otherwise of benchmark programs are given even
more emphasis by this result&rdquo; I just wonder how the other languages gave #0
