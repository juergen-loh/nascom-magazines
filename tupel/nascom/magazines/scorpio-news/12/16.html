hen 1 treated my aystem to ite Gemini GMB22 SVC (video) board, T found that Le
was possible for it to operate &laquo; keyboard, taking sone of the Toad off the main
Processor This would let me make things go faster, which is becoming an
Obsessive pursuie &ldquo;But che SVC wanted to speak to either a serial or parallel
Keyboard ffom the Gemini range, and I happen to have a Nascom II keyboard
</p>
<p>
It would have cost quite a lot to buy either of the Gemini keyboards, 1 think
they are around the C140+VAT mark, ao that idea vas out But the dealer who
Said me the SvC (no names as I Feel they should pay for their advertising)
happened to mention that&rsquo;s member of &raquo; Thames Valley Nascom weer group had sade
Upvtome boards that would fit in between the Netcom iI keyboard and the SVC. He
Ghid that these boards had a cpu of their own, which just scanned the keye and
passed on what it found
</p>
<p>
As well os the advantage of things running faster, this would also let me take
Advantage of the keyboard type-ahead that the SVC allows, So if you happen to
be in potsession of a spare one of the converter boards, T vould be very pleased
to hear From you I might even buy one if the price is sensible. Incidentally,
Tohave heard that perhaps this user group has been photocopying magazines This
practice is of course illegal, but copying my stuff also carries # curse the
{ite &lsquo;of which has not been around since the Pharaohs.

There is always a catehi
</p>
<p>
The catch in this case ds that if I do take the keyboard scanning load avay from
the main processor, it vill mean that my CP/M will need to be sorted cut te
Eecognise the new keyboard, Instead of carrying out che originel scanning
Foutine But I have been meaning to do that for apes, in order to wse the new
Improved BIOS software that is now available (I hear it goes faster) end vad
described in the last&rsquo; Scorpio News
</p>
<p>
No great problem, apart from finding the time, you might think However, ay
CP/H has Already been modified to provide a RAM&rsquo; ditk on two MAP-00 RAM boards,
and T have no idea what they have done, or where they did it 1 suppose 1 will
have to find where the old CP/M and the present one are different, and then
disassemble the new bits The result will then need to be incorporated in the
improved system Maybe MaP-60 will write an article about how their
notification vorks. I think thet would be very interesting to read, and it
Could also give some clues about another thing 1 would do, 1f 1 only knew how
it &ldquo;would belvery handy in certain circumstances to be able to get CF/M to think
the RAM disk Is drive A, and vice versa There is still some software around
that insists on beang on drive A, which T would Like better If it went et drive
P speeds: az anyone managed to achieve thir? Then tell ux all how, don&rsquo;t keep
iv to yourself!

In case you didn&rsquo;t buy the first Lssue of Scorpio News, here is the Pascal
version of a benchmark program from Dr Dobbs&rsquo; Journal (no relation) no 83, which
is supposed to show you how fast and how accurate the language you are using is
