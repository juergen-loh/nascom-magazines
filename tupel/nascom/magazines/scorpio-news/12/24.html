Memory Based Named Directory Segment.

<p>
&lsquo;As intimated above, I feel that this facility is not of any especial advantage
On a single user system based on a couple of smallish floppies. On a aysten
Wich &lsquo;several users, eapecially where @ Winchester 1a used, the situation te
Complecely different. If this facility Le enabled, up to 14 (Could be extended
at cost of more memory) Names may be allocated to Drives and USER areas. Thus
Ates*containa wily files Als: containe moat ayaten ueilitien, etc. Typical
ame ellocations are:
</p>
<p>
Ab == HELP, ALS &ndash; ROOT, AO &ndash; BASE, CO &ndash; BAK, PO -&mdash; HDSK
</p>
<p>
The names allocaced are a matter of user preference. I kt

BAS. &lsquo;The main benefit of this ia that one does not have to reuent!
fone has ailocated to s certain function, The directory name iv displayed in the
proape:
</p>
<p>
AO:BASE&gt; &mdash;&mdash;CO:BAK&gt;. = BG:PAS&gt;&mdash;&mdash;PO:MDSK&gt; ets
To move about one may use either the DU: or DIR form and so-

In addition Z system utilities recognize either DU: or DIR: form s0-

&lsquo;password of up to 8 characters Long. For
more security, the DU: form of access may be disabled, so that password
Protected directories become more secure, eopecially to non technical user
Bheel protection of Disabling of the &ldquo;Peek conaand, and removal of debug
urilities would be strictly necessary to give added protection where mor
experienced users were using the system A moderately secure system is possible
however, in a mule! user environment
</p>
<p>
fone perescular point about allowing DIR names and USER areas to be displayed in
the CCP prompts is thet the screen edit feature of Gost of our BI0S&rsquo;s needs to
be modified This Feature starts by looking for the &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; prompt in the EDIT Line
returned from che Screen, and in both SYS and MAP BYOs&rsquo;s Starts at aboue the sth
Character out from the start of the Line. I have modified this to start out at
about the 12th character ae the extra data before the &lsquo;&gt;&rdquo; can ove this prompt
Character well out Lato the Line If the BIOS source is available this can be
eesily changed, otherwise it becomes # question of asking the supplier co tell
you which byte changes the start point of this routine, or doing a Dit of work
