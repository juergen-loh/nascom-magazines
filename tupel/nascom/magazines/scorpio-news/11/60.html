since MBASIC {s both expensive and long in the tooth Tt would be very
interesting to compare the speed and accuracy of the Microsoft compatible

&lsquo;the trigonometric functions produced penalties in all cases in both accuracy
and/or speed. If the program wes run without them, the result war very clove to
2500 in ait but one case (HP4) &ndash; with a range of 2499-69 co 2301.03. The
timings were halved (approximately). HPs gave a result of 2472 00; rather a

Ie will be fairly obvious that a benchmark test ie not the &ldquo;be-all and end-all&rdquo;
neither {s it an infallible guide to which Language should be used on your
Bachine For most non-professional users, the question of &laquo; second language may &ndash;

From my own experience, I aust say that differences in timing due to
sechicecturai coal guration &pound; US machines are small.
lon of CP/M (in my case 2.2)
BO &lsquo;(ceim us) ts US machines provided that at Le
OF RAM (for Les b &lsquo;ory function) and Gemini or MAP 80 video and floppy
disk controllers are available inthe system. It is a delight to use and hes
&lsquo;many handy factlicies which make it much more versatile than CP/M 22. It does

Used on the BBC/TORCH&rdquo; &ldquo;Tt &ldquo;has some nice facilities but it is incredibly slow.
CP/M, for all its snags, is supercharged by comparison!

<p>
Uitimately, then, the choice is dictated by the application for which you will
be running most of your programs. Few people will vant co carry out several
thousand trig. opecations but 1t does imply that &laquo; slow performance in the
benchmarks given in this article will be a disadvantage when running programs in
Vhich a Tot of use is aade of graphics. The veme Lt likely vo be true of
Programs in which there is a significent amount of &lsquo;number crunching&rdquo;, and
Accuracy (or the Lack of it) aay be a serious problen.

I haven&rsquo;t yet come across a benchmark which will test the speed of string
handling, and disk i/o tests will depend crucially upon the type of drive,
Stepping rate, type of FIC and such software horrors as the efficiency of the
8008 code and the way in which data is written to and read from the disk
There&rsquo;s a lor to be said for using # virtual disk of some of the newer 96701
drives vith 3 me stepping rates, 4 great improvement on the Micropolis&rsquo; 10 a8
land Pertec&rsquo;s 25 me Ie would appear that the HSA-8B8 offers a lot of scope for
increased speed and (possibly) accuracy but coste as much as or nore than many
Compilers &ldquo;It would be Interesting to see how s 16 Dit FORTRAN oc PASCAL copet
with the Dobbs &lsquo;Benchmark both with and without the aid of the 8087 arithmetic
Co-processor that can be added to the GHOSE.

<p>
By way of @ postscript, the performance of the obsolete UKIOI was quite
impressive and supports ay feeling that ROM BASICs on 6302 machines tend to be
rather more efficient than either disk or ROM BASICS on the majority of 6080/260
machines, I had, some time ago, run the first of the programs mentioned in this
article on # UKIOL running at&rsquo;2 Mie and it pottered through in about 40 seconds
