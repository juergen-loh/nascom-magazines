block size depends on the individual compater system The maximum length of
block ie limited only by the availabiiity of memory to hold the block in the
Computer. To identity a block on Phase Encoded and Croup Coded Recording the
feva preamble before the block and a postamble after the block. These are
Fecorded so that the machine knows where a block starte and where &laquo; block
Finishes. &ldquo;Blocks are not numbered nor Ls there any record of their length | The
system vorks out the length of a block by counting the cumber of bytes read
Between the preamble and the postanble.

File Marks or Tape Marks
Tn order to divide the tape into files a special type of block is recorded &ndash;
thig is called a file mark or tape mack&rdquo; The file mark does not contain any
eseful information. Tt is just a place marker. When &laquo; file aark is read c
Special signal is sent from the tape deck to the host computer. This uaually
Guuses reading to cease, The file mark is weed to separate files on a cape: A
Further use of the file mark is at the end of the data on a tape Usually the
end of the recorded data on a tape ip well before the reflective &pound;OT marker- To
sugaify that there te no more valid date on the tape two or more file mark
Blocks are written next to each other. If one fale mark is encountered and the
system ts asked to read the neat file and another file
</p>
<p>
Found, with no date block being read, the system knows that
end of valid data&rsquo; Some systems write several file marks at the end of
good measure.
</p>
<p>
Adding Filee to a Tape
When # file is to be added to a tape, the tape is positioned to the file mark
</p>
<p>
just after the last file When cecording restarts all of the extra file marks
are overwritten, At the end of the new file multiple file marks are written,

Headers, Volume Lebele and Trailers
As cen be seen from the above, there is no directory system on a tape. It
</p>
<p>
Rerely consists of files recorded one after the other This is quite
Seclefactory for some applications when it is sufficient to stick a paper Lebel
on the tape reel to identify the contents. Most scientific and engineering
applications find this adequate.
</p>
<p>
In commercial data processing departments where many more tapes are handled and
they are kept in big libraries amore formal scheme is required A system of
Headers and Trailers has been developed so that each file in fact consists of 3
</p>
<p>
efilee The firet is the i &lsquo;the second the date file itself, and the
fird the trailer or &ldquo;End Of File header",
</p>
<p>
Each reel of tape is known as a Volume &ndash; just as with books. To identify the
volume the first header file on the tape has an additional record in the first
block and this is known as the Volume Label or Volume Header
</p>
<p>
Another type of label that is encountered is the End of Volume This is used
when it 1a necessary for s file to continue on to another volume of tape
Instead of an end of file header at the end of daca, the end of volume label is
lised to signify that the file cerries on to another tape volume
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The exact content of these headers varies from system to aysten. Standards have
been produced by ANSI, ECMA, 150 and IBM These are all similar in principle
dat differ in detail. Tt will be found for instance that IBM use the EBCDIC
character representation Instead of the ASCII used by the other
