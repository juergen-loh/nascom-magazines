Ficstly you speak as Sf, with the demise of the 80-BUS magazine, all
components and future expansion for the Hascom and Gemini through &lsquo;the 8O-BUS,
Will cease to exist. THIS Is MOST DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE. I know full well
that you have noc attended Gemini dealer meetings, where various people, most
potably John Marshell, the HD, have repeated ad nauseam that there Jp no
Sneention of phasing ovt the 80-BUS components until well into the nineteen
Rineties, aleNough work on future products, most notably the development of the
68000 based Challenger series will reduce the destgn effort devoted. to. 90-BUS,
In fact, it has been hinted, there are some surprising developments forthcoming
in 80-BUS products in the near future. (I have no iden what these are, a8 T
consider that all that needs to be avaliable for e0-BUS fs already available }

I would argue that a new board is probably not viable as ay clo
veociacion with the curcent market suggests entirely contrary conclusions
ose you eite for the viability of the board.

Firetly, the kit market (for anything, be it computers or single transistor
audio pre-amps) is rapidly declining, It is now cheaper to buy # fully working,
built item, than co build it yourself, Ok, the built item may not be entirely
what you vant, but the electronic buying public ae &amp; whole are not prepared to
pey the money for a kit which does exactly what they want I know, because ay
Eompany and many others have tried to revitelice this market, and {t&rsquo;s just noe
there. Go and ask any reteil componente tupplier. This decline in the Kit
market obviously affects the price of discreet componente, forcing the price
Spiral upuards whilst depressing the marker it is supposed to generate.

several attempts to introduce new single board computers on the bo:
