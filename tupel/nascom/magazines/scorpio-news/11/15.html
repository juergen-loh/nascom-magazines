&lsquo;The form of the FUNCTION statement is as follows:
</p>
<p>
FUNCTION name (dummy arguments &ndash; if needed)
</p>
<p>
or, more explicitly.
type FUNCTION neme (dummy arguments)
</p>
<p>
The reason for the second form is that the type can be explicitly declared a
INTEGER, REAL, DOUBLE PRECTSTON, LOGICAL or (In Profortran) COMPLEX. Thus, if
che function required was called LENGTH and it was a REAL number rather than sn
INTEGER, the correct form for the FUNCTION subprogram which gave the single
value for LENGTH would
</p>
<p>
REAL FUNCTION LENGTH
</p>
<p>
The same rule applies {f the function name is one which by default would bea
REAL If an INTEGER value was required Por example:
</p>
<p>
INTEGER FUNCTION AREA
</p>
<p>
INTRINSIC FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p>
In all high-level languages, there is a range of particular functions for which
the necessary code ie supplied &ndash; such as INT or ANG in BASIC. These are termed
Intrinsic functions and afe called by name to produce &laquo; particular velue. There
ire rather gore intrinsic functions in FORTRAN than will be found in most, BASICS
ince some are available in integer, real and double precision forms There is
Alvays &raquo; list of these in the documentation associated with the version of
FORTRAN &lsquo;you are using. Some old favourites Like CHRS and LEFTS ere never found
in FORTRAN, othere are spelt differently = SIGN rather than SGN &ndash; but most are
readily interpreted
</p>
<p>
[EXTERNAL FupcTIONs
</p>
<p>
Again, these have their counterparts in BASIC although many are available in
Goubis precision or even complex number forms in addition to the conventional
Feal number form &ndash; typical of these are the etigonometric functions, SIM, 00S OF
TAN, and Sgat spelt differently to the BASIC way (SQR). There is 10g base &copy;
(ALG) &lsquo;and log base 10 &lt;ALOGIO) and a random number generator &ndash; variously spelt
BND or RAND, &lsquo;A&rsquo;list of these will also be found in the documentation, together
with a Llse of restrictions on the type of variable with which they can be used
&ldquo;thus i8&rsquo;you want the equare root of # variable {t must be of type real of
Gouble precision and if it ta an integer, this must be converted to eal by the
vse of &amp; cunning Litele intrinsic function called FLOAT. Failure co do th:
First will lead to an execution error and the progran grinding to an
unprofitable halt An external function called TPIK dees just that to REAL
hunbers, converting thes to INTEGER type.

<p>
DATA Inpor /oozPoT
</p>
<p>
on fizet acquaintance, this appears co be rather more complicated than in BASIC,
but it is a great deel more flexible. Data to be read into or results output
fron s progtam can dein alaoat any desired form provided the machine is
properly instructed by meant of t FORMAT statement. Data is read in from either
Keyboard or disk file uring @ READ statement and written to the screen, disk
Eile&rsquo;oe peincer by means of WRITE statement in their beste form these a
follows:
</p>
<p>
READ (uf) k of &copy; WRITE (u,) k
