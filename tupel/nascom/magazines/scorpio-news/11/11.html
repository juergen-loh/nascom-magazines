<p>
DOUBLE PRECISION types are real data with an accuracy of greater than 16
Fignificant digits with the same cenge a real date
</p>
<p>
LOGICAL types ace single byte representations of TRUE. or FALSE, with
FALSE equivalent to zero and&nbsp;.TRUE has a value of -1; in practice, any non-zero
value will be treated az TRUE. in a logical IF statement.
</p>
<p>
HOLLERITH types (named in honour of the inventor of the punched card tabulator)
consist of &laquo;
set. They

variable has two components &ndash; a real pert and an ieaginary part &ndash; each of type
HEAL pes ipinary pes
</p>
<p>
FORTRAN constants are of types INTEGER, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, LOGICAL,
HOLLERITH and, additionally in/F80, MEXADECIMAL,
</p>
<p>
The INTEGER type has from 1 &ndash; 5 decimal digits together with a &lsquo;-&rdquo; sign if
</p>
<p>
appropriate eg 521, 2, -45, 00022
</p>
<p>
REAL types have 7 digit precision and are represented either in floating point
(F) or exponent (E) format. For example, 3.21456 is a floating point REAL
Constant and 0:321456E 1 Le the exponent eqidvelent &ndash; es in BASIC the ure of the
SE&rdquo; indicates &lsquo;10 co the power&rsquo; and the figure that follows is the index of the
power &ndash; in this case, 1. REAL numbers can be positive or negative and must have
E&rsquo;decimal point. They will be truncated 1f the number of figures exceeds the

<p>
Seated Level of precision.
</p>
<p>
DOUBLE PRECISION type constants have &laquo; higher Level of precision and obey the
</p>
<p>
rules for REAL numbers &ndash; but with more Eignificant figures or the use of &ldquo;D&rdquo; in

the exponent format &ndash; thug 4172345860098 ie a double precision nunber as is &ndash;
yeep&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
LOGICAL constants are either TRUE or FALSE. and generate PF (hex) snd 0 (hex)
</p>
<p>
LITERAL constants are strings of any character except the single quote (*),
enclosed by single quotes. &ldquo;QWERTYUIOP&rdquo; 14 one auch constant
</p>
<p>
HEXADECIMAL constants are Found in P80 but earely in other FORTRAN versions. The
Constant consists of up to 4 hexadecimal digits enclosed in single quotes and
preceded bys Zor X ZFAL2&rdquo; and X2C&rdquo; are examples.
</p>
<p>
FORTRAN variables are identified by symbolic names vhich are strings of 1 to 6
alphanam \ctere which are unique to the program in vhich they are used.

<p>
Variables are (by default) of types denoted by the initial letter and the
convention {s that integer variables have names deginning with any Lecter from T
to Nand real variables begin with A. Hand O- 2 To complicate matters
Slightly, a variable may explicitly be assigned to a different type by
Gecfaration at the beginning of a program or subroutine &ldquo;Thus START is a real
variable and ISTART is an incegee variable by default, but by means of #7
explicit declaration statement!
