<p>
The logical expression is evaluated as TRUE or FALSE. Lf true, control
passes to the statement immediately following othervise control passes to the
Boxe program ine, the, Togical expression &lsquo;can contain both Logical and
Felatsonal operators, which are defined as follows:

<p>
Logical operators

<p>
NOT. AND. OR, .xOR.
Relational operators

<p>
If A and B are logical expressions, then:
</p>
<p>
Nor a is the Logical opposite of A (0 bits become 1 and vice versa)
</p>
<p>
A.AND.B the value of this expression 4s the product (logical) of A and
B. This implies that the value Je TRUE. if A and B are
sTRUE. and &ldquo;FALSE. otherwise
</p>
<p>
A,OR.B this produces the Logi In this case the
value is FALSE. If Avan -TRUE. othervise.
</p>
<p>
A.XOR.B the value of this expression is the exclusive OR of A and B.
Here, che value ie :TRUE. 1f only one of A and Bis&nbsp;.TRUE.
