SISOFT C, DOES IT HURT?

No, Lt doesn&rsquo;t hurt your pocket, just your head. For very Little money you get
a good manual, s good screen editor and a good compiler. But the Language
irgelf civals Forth for unreadability. (I know, you can write Forth so thet
&lsquo;ther people can read it, but who actusily does?)

pful tutorial section, and the editor ts
fe for programming use, as it has atl the handy facilities Like auto
Indentation. Tt will not do justification though, of word-wrep, like your
favourite word processor the really claver bit comes vhen the compiler finds &laquo;
mistake In your C program, It re-enters the editor at or near the error, for
you to fix it Exit from the edicor, end the compiler has another try. 1 Like
this, ie saves &raquo; lot of the time weually spent giving commands to the compiler
and editor on other systems! (I believe the nevest version of the Wisoft Pascal
Compiler also does this, and vill let you know when T get mine updated )

The version of C implemented has no floating point numbers at all, just
integecs, which is # pity. It {4&rsquo;s surprise toa, given the goad floating point
Support in the Pascal compiler. I just hope they will be doing &raquo; version for
the Belectra board, as well as an ordinary 260 version, vhen thay do add floats
The system ag supplied, and the programs it compiles, &lsquo;certainly vork, and T am
finding them helpful in my attempts to learn yet another Language, but it is aot
a pretty Language!

PRESTEL ON PLUTO

<p>
wentioned above, I am writing a Prestel program to put a display on the Pluto
&lsquo;d, Instead of using the useful &ldquo;Pretzel Ti T bought with the MODEM which
uses the svc (or an IVC} for its display. When finished, thie vill have quite
few fancy facilities, which would normally make it well worth trying to market
the program However, how many people Aave compatible hardware?&rdquo; Tf either of
them is interested in a copy, they can contact me to arrange &amp; swap for some
Pluto program of their own writing, Anything pretty, Like Mandelbrot set stuff,
or flight simulators, would be most acceptable.
