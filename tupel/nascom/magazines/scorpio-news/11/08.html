For those of you who don&rsquo;t know Mirage, it is a real-time, multi-user, multi-tasking
networking 08 specifically developed for the 68000 CPU and, fike the
Challenger, it is British. The first Mirage-based Challengers were shipped
early in 1986 and Marston Spurtier became the Distributor of Mirage Language
processors and software for Gemini Challenger dealers At refinements have Deen
Bade both to Mirage (with &amp; new version due for release as Scorpio News nite the
Streecs} and the Challenger when running Mirage, the combinetion 13 (Nick
Believes) formidable and there is no competition ae to price/performance
</p>
<p>
Marston Spurrier&rsquo;s business is now wholly based on Challenger systems sales and
Gevelopment of new software and utilities for Mirage. For example, the latest
product is a Mirage software driver to read Gemini CP/M (80, 86, 6Bk) disks.

&lsquo;A Review of the Newburn Opto-input Board by M. Black
</p>
<p>
For our particular application, we needed to Interface a variety of different
Voltages to the @0-8U5 We saw an advert from Newburn Eleccronies for thelr
NEO71 opro-input board Te seemed just what we needed av the board ts self-contained,
and unlike the Maas boord does not cequire the Gemini GMa16 I/O board
todrive ie (therefore less BUS slots are required) We ordered a board with
plug-in sodules for 8 of each 12Y, 24v, SOV and 110V sensitivity We also
Srdered the industrial Kiippon termination.
</p>
<p>
We ceceived the board within a few days On inspection, the board seemed well
ade with a comprehensive manual. It&rsquo;s nice to see that 0-BUS manufacturers
now include board-ejeccors as standard, this saves many grazed knuckles
</p>
<p>
We set the board address to Hex $40 using the on-board Dil-svitch and plugged
the board into the rack We used (0 way ribbon cable to connect the board to
the Kiippon block&rdquo; The K1zppon black mounted easily on the rear of the rack
sing standard Flippon rai
</p>
<p>
Connecting a suitable voltage to the correct Klippon terminals, lit the
corresponding LED on the board. We found it very handy being able to see the
State of atl inputs using the LEDs
</p>
<p>
Programming of the board was carried out using Turbo Pascal _ This was very
simple as all inputs are read from 4 ports, inthis case Hex $40 to Hex $43
Each bit of the port corresponds to one input.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, we found the board ideal for our application. Gone are the days
of birds nest&rsquo; wiring and resistive dividers hanging from the rear of connectors
Stc. Real inputs can be easily connected using the Klippon termination rail
This gave us the professional finich we required:
