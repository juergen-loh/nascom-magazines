Improving the CCP &ndash; CCPz/2cPR2
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;A number of very useful improvements can be made to the CCP. The standard
cor provides six butle in commands (DIK, ERA, REN, SAVE, USER and TYPE). There
is no creen paging support, no &ldquo;PATIM, and precious little else.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;There are two alternative software replac
</p>
<p>
approach to system improvement is to repli
</p>
<p>
earlier versions of 2CPk. programe are virtually
</p>
<p>
fon Z0PR in the SIG/M or CP/M User Group Library. ZCPR literally
&lsquo;code te us
</p>
<p>
snts for the CCP. The simplest
standard CCP with COPZ oF
ve bated
</p>
<p>
Tr #lto provides the following extra features which are nore fully described ia
the&nbsp;.00C &ldquo;Elles provided from the Library
</p>
<p>
4) Displays the names of ALL files removed by an ERA command
This can save potentially fatal errors.
</p>
<p>
b) Provides improved Directory display and SYS/DIR File options.
A)IL and S)ye options for DIRFSYS or SYS File display. Better directory
Formate may be selected for assembly.
</p>
<p>
8) Optionally displays the current USER nunber in CP/M prompt.
This is an assembly option.
</p>
<p>
4) Optionally provider screen paging support for screen output.
May be asscabled to default to on or off. parameter will toggle
this option. (Normally off on this system ax B1OS will provide better
</p>
<p>
paging.)
(e) Allows default USER area to be altered, eg: DFU
</p>
<p>
This would mean that the path&rsquo; would search USER 3 and not 0. The USER
number may be given in Decimal or Kex. eg: DFU TH.
</p>
<p>
+) Provides a GET comand to load a file to menory.
Eg: GET 8000 MYPILE.COM would load MYFILE.COM in memory at 8000H.
</p>
<p>
8) Provides JUMP and GO commands to operate &laquo; TPA resident program.
JUMP will &lsquo;call&rsquo; # subroutine. eg; JUMP E000H.
Go will call the subroutine at 100H. eg. Restart MBASIC etc. GO Is the
fame as JUMP 1008
</p>
<p>
h) The SAVE command allovs HEX of DECIMAL, PAGES or SECTORS
eg: SAVE 18 TEST.COM or SAVE 12H TEST.COM to save 16 pages. You may
also give Number of sectors with &ldquo;Ss&rdquo; parameter. eg: = SAVE 108
ANOTHER.ONE Sor SAVE 16 ANOTHER.ONE &lsquo;S Tor 8 Pages. &ldquo;N.B 236 byte
page&rsquo; or 128 byte &ldquo;sector
</p>
<p>
i) More flexible handling of SUBMITS and CCP buffer default Cold Boor
Commands.
</p>
<p>
J) Provides a LIST comand to send a file to the printer.
eg: LIST THISPILE.TXT- The CBIOS will page the printer.
</p>
<p>
k) Provides a search path for required&nbsp;.coM file
This Se #0 useful that Lt merits a fuller description.
</p>
<p>
With a normal CCP if you tesue a command Like &lsquo;STAT&rsquo; then CP/M will look
for STAT.COM on the current drive and USER ares. If the file is not found, CP/M
will give up with # query &ldquo;STAT?!
</p>
<p>
With coP2/ZcPR a three level search is performed, The COP will look in the
current user area of the default drive. If the file is not found, user area 0
Of the default disk ie searched, Tf ul USER 0 of drive Ar is searched,
Tf che file te etill not found, cp/M will give up with the usual query. This
