translation table (known ae logical sectors). In other words, using the table,
when sector 0 ie required we find that the data will be read from sector 0 but
when sector 1 13 required, we actually read from sector 3. If you compare the

Getting back to the physical disk format, Let us now look at what {s physically
Written to the Wisk during formatting. Most dlek controllers format the disk by
writing &laquo; complete track at a time To do this, the host microcomputer will have
Tesembied a memory image of the track which it will then transfer to the FOC
(Eloppy disk controller) chip The data consists of gaps, index and address
marke, track, side and sector numbers, CRC bytes and of course the areas for
Saving the date.
</p>
<p>
Let us break the track up into its component parts and examine them in detail
starting with the track, side and sector information and the area for che dat
</p>
<p>
Each disk sector is preceded by an identification block containing information
about that sector. thie block is six bytes in length and is identified to che
Hbe chip by an 1D addrese mark immediately before the block. The data in the
block is #8 follows:
</p>
<p>
1 bye &ndash; Track Number
Lbyte &gt; Side wumber
i byte &copy; Sector Number
L byte &ndash; Sector Length
2 bytes = ORE byt
</p>
<p>
The track and sector numbers on the disk may Lie in the range 0 to 255 although
this will obviously be limited to the number of tracks that the disk drive is
Capable of accessing and the number of sectors thet vill fit on one track of the
Gssk The side number takes the value 0 or 1 The gector length byte (with the
PD1797) may f211 in the range 0 to 3 and the values correspond to sector sizes
of 128, 256, 312 or 1024 bytes respectively The two CRC bytes are automatically
Computed by&rsquo; the FDC chip and will be written to the disk when instructed to do
Se&rsquo;by the host computer
</p>
<p>
When the POC fe instructed to read a sector, it first waits for an ID address
mark and then reads the 1D block Tf the side, track and sector information
fatches the values given by the host computer, and if no CRC ercor has occurred,
the FOC will transfer data from the dats area following the TD block. The data
area will be of the Length indicated by the sector length byte and is preceded
by a Data Address mark on the disk. Initially, the date contains the value
OBSH for every byte. This value 49 set during formatting but in fact any value
could have been used. OSH because TEM used this

Writing @ sector is eimilar to reading but after the correct ID block has been
found, a data address mark is written to the disk followed by the nunber of dal
