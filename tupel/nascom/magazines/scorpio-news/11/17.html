EXPERIMENT 1 (assuming that L had a value of 1)
</p>
<p>
P80 and Profortran recognite ten different types of I/O field descriptor:
Alphanumeric [A &ndash; 2, 0 &ndash; 9 ete.)
</p>
<p>
Double precision numerse
</p>
<p>
Exponent form {e g 1 1606 = 11,000]
</p>
<p>
Floating poine [eg 12 34)

</p>
<p>
These are fairly standard for most FORTRANS but NFortran does not have Double
Precision or the scaling descriptor P. It does have T (tabulation), K
(hexadecimal) and 2 (inhibit &lt;erj1&pound;&gt; on output) which might be useful
</p>
<p>
Most users will only be concerned with A.&pound;,P.H.1 and X descriptors: apart from
the Wand Y descriptors, which have the general forms nll or nX where n is the
umber of coluans each descriptor covers, the rest have the operational form c2y
where &copy; ig the suaber of repetitions of the field descriptor if this it grater
than 1, Zap the descriptor type and y giver inforaation sbout the total width
of field required For each repetition.
</p>
<p>
Some examples vould not come amiss here &ndash;
</p>
<p>
LOA indicates 10 alphanumeric fields each 4 columns vide
</p>
<p>
Fe&rsquo;2 indicates 1 exponent field 8 columns wide, where there are two
Higures after the decimal point This 12343.6) is represented
Ss 012605 (where the&rdquo; represents @ blank colunn ia which
nothing ie printed)
</p>
<p>
B12 5 ie. a single exponent field of 12 columns in which 5 Figure
Follow the decimal point and = figuee such ay -12.349678 would
be cepresented ae 012303602 This implies thar the number
As tfuncared (shortened) and loses some accuracy.
</p>
<p>
F320 shows that a floacing point number oceupying 3 coluans ig
Involved which has no significant numbers to the cight of the
Gecinal point, /.0 er 20 would be shows ia thie way
</p>
<p>
F8 4 Shows that the floating point (real) number occupies 6 coluant
and has 4 digits to the right of the decimal point 123 4367
{2s suitable example: s real number such as&rsquo;-34 89085 would
bbe &lsquo;shown se 34 8909, &lsquo;since the field only permits &copy; teximum
of 4 digite after the decimal point Overflow can occur if the
umber of digits to the left of the decimal point cannot be
Fitted Into the space avaliable &ndash; thus 12456 would be
printed ar *56&rsquo;- the esterisk shows that the field width was
foo saall
</p>
<p>
413 indicates that there are four 3 digit integer fields involved;
thus 121, 245, 778 and 200 ave repeesented as: 123249778200
while -30, 2, 45 and 559 are represented by -30&rdquo; 2.43559.&rdquo; In
the latter case, the *-&rdquo; sign occupies 1 of the columns in its
Eleld and the numbers with less than 3 digits are right

</p>
<p>
4X thie shows that 4 columns are to be skipped (not read or
printed)
