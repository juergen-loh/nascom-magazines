&lsquo;A useful List of basic BASIC statements and commands ie given in Monro (1978)
T don&rsquo;t think that either of the usual PASCALs (Hi-Soft and COMPAS) give any
Indication of which of thelr statements and commands are non-standard as fara!

Documentation

<p>
For many people, particularly those not familiar with &laquo; program, adequate
documentation is essential, so its provision is a major and often disliked part
Of program developaent, &ldquo;If a progeam ie for your own use, why bother? The
trouble is that one&rsquo;s menory is not faultless ands lot of time and temper cen
be wasted, A good extmple of documentation is that provided with the various
PEN programs &ndash; &lsquo;well set out and comprehensible to the average dodo. We all know
of bad examples!

In an ideal world, our carefully written, wall-documented program would produce
the right reaults from whatever data we stuffed into it&rsquo;- er it would do in
bther ways, what twas deeigned for- Unfortunately, this ie rarely the cate
and even after extensive debugging, it may still refuse to function properly. A
program should, once it hav been found to be error-free, both in teras of syntex
{confusion of i and 1, 2 and Zor O and 0, for example or the wrong number of
brackets) and the results obtained, be &lsquo;error-trapped&rsquo; so that an incorrect or
out-of-range input does not throw i into a state of utter confusion so that the
Bachine crashes or an incorrect result is output&rdquo; This takes a litle time to
Organise but ie vell worthwhile. Test data may work perfectly but real data may
produce odd results so one&rsquo;s test data should, where possible, include valuer
Tying at the &lsquo;extremes which are Likely to be encountered. Commercial pach
