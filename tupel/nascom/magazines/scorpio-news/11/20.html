PAUSE statement
&lsquo;This command also stops the execution of the progcam. It either takes the form:
</p>
<p>
PAUSE or PAUSE (string of 1 &ndash; 6 characters)
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The characters, if present are displayed as before and program execution can be
resumed if needed by typing eny chacacter other than &lsquo;T&rdquo; &ndash; which terminates the
program at that point. This statement should be used with care since not all
FORTRAN compilers support it in precisely this fashion.
</p>
<p>
CALL statement,
</p>
<p>
This statement transfers control into subroutines and provides part
Use by the subroutine. Tt hag the general for
</p>
<p>
CALL subroutine name (dummy arguments)
</p>
<p>
Dumny arguments ace values of expression which need to be transferred from the
CALLing program fo the subroutine so that it can work properly. A nore detailed
Geplanstion it given in Alcock (pp 68-69) oF in the Microsoft F-60, NFortren oF
ProFortran documentation.
</p>
<p>
RETURN statements
&lsquo;These are always used when control {8 to be passed back from the subroutine to
the CALLing program,
</p>
<p>
Do statements
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;These provide a means for executing series of statements repetitively, just
inthe FOR = NEXT loop In BASIC. The DO statement takes the following fora:
</p>
<p>
DOT K*HL.M2.M3 = of, where M3 fs 1, Lt may be omitted
iy {s&rsquo;a"seatoment label, Kis an integer or variable
and Hi, HZ end M3 are integer conetante or integer
or variables]
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;A typical example might be:
bo 16 12,5
{a series of executable statements)
</p>
<p>
24 PROD=PROD + AC)
GRITE(S,100) &ldquo;PROD
200 FORMAT (#6 3)
</p>
<p>
in which the program executes che DO loop five times (as I goes from 1 to 3)
before writing out the regult The statement label J must actually occur and it
Bust not be a STOP, PAUSE, RETURN, arithmetic IF, GOTO or another DO. The
Controlling index K imuse bean integer and alvays positive: M3 is the inet
</p>
<p>
thus if the first Line of the DO loop wae replaced by:
</p>
<p>
Do 14 191,9,2
</p>
<p>
successive loops would increment rhe value of I by 2 (1,3,5.7,9) rather than
singly: this Ls analogous to the STEP statement in BASIC and some versions of
PASCAL. &lsquo;DO Loops can be nested so that one or more may exist within che range
of a Larger loop but these nested loops aust terainare inside the main loop.
Diner features Of DO loops are noted in the Microsoft or Prospero reference
anal.
