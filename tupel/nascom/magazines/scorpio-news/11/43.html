DOCIRENTATION
</p>
<p>
This ie adequate and consists of a detailed explanation of the port allocations
and their functions, program examples for the insertion of support. for the VEC
into a CP/M BIOS oi ing. the VFC with NAS-SYS, and details of she control
codes which the VFC recognizes. In view of the

change from some systems; unfortunately, no details are included for the
Land gather that there are difficulties in using the VFC with it. In the
fell re involved but not ali of these have to be used
Detasle are aleo given of modifications which need to be carried out if RAM
hoards (Gemini and Nescom) are to be used. No modifications are needed if the
MAP RAM card is used A Zinal section gives details of pin assignments on the
VEC and a useful note on TEAC, Pertec end Micropolis drive pin assignments
</p>
<p>
If the fully implemented VEC or the FOC-only aystem is purchased, HAP-00 Systeme
can supply s fully licensed version of CP/M 2 2 or 3 c with a Customised BIOS.
This te supplied wich a short instruction manual which explains how linkages are

Rerenges ae well os how co customise the 8105 for other features. Both parallel
and serisl printer output and screem editing using &ldquo;# are supported A&rsquo;spectal
boot FROM is supplied which replaces the RP/M boot EPROM If the CPU card it &amp;
owes.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the usual CP/M files on the disk, and the customised MOVcPH.COM
or CPMS.SYS, a multi-utility program is supplied, which allows users to format,
verify or copy dicks. MAP will also customise existing users&rsquo; CP/M on request
at a ceasonable cost.

<p>
THE vec TH USE
</p>
<p>
The fully implemented card has two 3 pin connectors for the video input and
output, which are incompatible with the Gemini CM&amp;12 IVC video output which is a
Standard jack socket requiring en enormovt plug. Why Gemini use this gargantuan
imeans of taking Out. the video pussies ne since Nascom found some small coaxial
Connectors for their AVC which are really neat. I&rsquo;m nor all that keen on MAP-80&rsquo;s
connector either and I&rsquo;m sure that there must be ail sortt of impedance
Rismatches pince neither type is likely to approach 75 ohms of whatever a
Monitor is upposed to need to produce a good display The keyboard and disk
drives are plugged in to the board &ndash; using non-latched 1D connectors which are a
Little difeicele to unplug when needed.
</p>
<p>
On booting up, a aysten message 12 dtaplayed together with the CP/M prompr:
Connands aay then be entered the display ic 80 counts wide and because of th
alternative character&rsquo; set, both noradl or laverse (black on waite) character
Can be displayed, or an alvernative character set which can be progreamed into @
Gis or 2782 EPROM and plugged Into the second 20M socket
</p>
<p>
The memory-mapped display appears to be quite fase and free from visible
Interference as a consequence of CPU and ORT controller interaction, # has
already been mentioned, the GeaJal video controllers have Z80 CPUs on beard and
lunder Certain circumstances on the IVC some interference can take place which
Produces a faint diagonal patterning on the screen &ndash; which can be irritating
Under some screen display conditions The cause possibly lies in the layout of
the IVC board where one or two long-ish tracks radiated noise which was picked
up by other parts of the system This problem appears to have been resolved
with the Gemini SVC which hess auch more legible screen display than ite

<p>
I experienced no problems with the floppy disk controller when using Pertec (48
TI) &lsquo;and TEAC, &lsquo;Canon or Miteublehi (96 TP) drives &ndash; which are plu ble.
The Mitsubishi drives were quietest in operation.
