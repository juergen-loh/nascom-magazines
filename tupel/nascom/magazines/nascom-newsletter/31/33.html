the printer can conveniently be connected to the uncoma tted
P10 chip supplied with Nascom&nbsp;2 and 3. We suggest using a 25-way
D-type connector for this purpose. The wiring between this and
the Nascom&nbsp;2 board should be carried out as described in
application note AN-OOS (this connection ts already made on
Nascom&nbsp;3?

NAS-DOS users who have returned their registration form #11
have recerved a Utilities Disc containing some utility routines
to simplify use of printers of any of these types from BASIC,
the monitor NASPEN and ZEAP.

ZEAP and NAS-PEN both assune printers of this type for
