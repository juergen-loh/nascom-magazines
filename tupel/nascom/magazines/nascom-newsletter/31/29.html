1. A fault occurred in the automatic serialisation of some
copies of NAS-SEMBLER which can result in errors when using the
7280 command in edit and the EDIT command in Z80. Fortunately
this can be corrected quite easily. Simply execute EDIT in the
normal way and then use the COPY command to re-save the program.
</p>
<p>
efor Z80. This ensures that the programs are saved
with the correct length, so as not to conflict mith the data

and in the summary on page 14 an being used to delete lines.

on page @ of the manual). the command used for deleteing line
io ERASE Sy wheres rs the line number of the first line and y
15 the line number of the last line to be deleted, This, error
crept in when the meaning of the two commands was reversed ata
late stage of development.
