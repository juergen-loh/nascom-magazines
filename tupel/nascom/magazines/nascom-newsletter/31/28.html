<p>
We are now using NAS-SYS 3A instead of NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 in the

is performed automatically to switch in the normal display
rather than the AVC in machines fitted with the AVC. If you
have NAS-SYS&nbsp;3, an AVC and the means to blow your own EPROM you
can change your existing NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 to SA by making the following

PCB which mounte ante the board in place of LKSI and) the MD
PROM. This incorporates a number of relays, and it only needs a
two-pole switch to activate this board to switch from NAS-DOS to
CP/M. We have used this ourselves, and 1t is an Approved
