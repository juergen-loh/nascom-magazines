connectors. Those making their own cable should use the standard
25-way D-type connectors and make the following connections

The connection for the computer to receive data is only required

2.2 Serial printers with handshake
</p>
<p>
These printers require the additional *handshake&rsquo; line to be
connected in order that the printer can notify the computer when
Printing is to be suspended pending emptying of the printer
memory. Normally your dealer will supply suitable connectors and
cables, but if you wish to make up your awn you should follow
the instructions below
</p>
<p>
The printer handshake may be either at a5 volt TIL level,
in the case of the Nascom Imp printer, or may be at 12 volt
RS232 levels. The connections to be made should te exactly as
described for the seria! printer without handshake but mith the
following additional connection.
</p>
<p>

D-type D-type pin
20 Handshake at 12 volts 20 8
</p>
<p>
Pin @ of PLZ must be connected to 1P3 an the main beard.
(Standard on all recent production Nascom&nbsp;2&rsquo; and 3&rsquo;s).
</p>
<p>
The handshake signal input must be limited to 5 volt TTL
levels, which is done ac follows: (this connection is standard
all_on current Nascom&nbsp;3*a)
</p>
<p>
Connect pin 20 of the D-type socket in the computer to a Ik
ohm resistor, the other end of the resistor being connected to
the &ldquo;junction of 2 diodes (eg INAoOI). One of these diodes i=
connected ta the ground pin (7) ang the other to the grey lead
from pin 8 of PL2r in both cases the cathade at the diode (the
end marked with a ring in most cases) is connected ta the common
junction.
</p>
<p>
2.3 Parallel printer connections
</p>
<p>
Once again your dealer should he able to supply suitable
cables and connectors, which will be made un according to the
Gata given below for those assembling their own connections.
