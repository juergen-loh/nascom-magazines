to tape. This was to be achieved in a similar way to the naming
of program files from the Gk Basic. The required routines were
written and provided many advantages over the facilities within
Basic. (e.g. forty two character names and tape label
processing.) However, a big problem remained. How could the new
routines be easily used? The aim was to find a method of calling
the new routines by using a single letter followed by the
necessary arguments &ndash; that is, in the same way as you might use
NAS-SYS &lsquo;W&rdquo; or &lsquo;R&rsquo;. After much head scratching and may reems af
assembler Coated paper, the problem was solved. It was decided
to use the lower case letters of the alphabet&rsquo; as the command
letters Cw&rsquo; for named file write, &lsquo;r&rsquo; for named file read, &lsquo;v&rdquo;
for named file verify, etc.) Part of the head scratching had
resulted in a method of &lsquo;hooking into&rsquo; the main input loop of
NAS-SYS, thereby providing a means of branching to SYS-EX
processing whenever a lower case command letter was keyed. This
method did not require any changes to NAS-SYS, so there was no
fon-standard EPROM blowing to do. During the development of
SYS-EX, the author upgraded his Nascom&nbsp;2 from NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 to
NAS-SYS&nbsp;3. As a result of this, the &lsquo;haoking into&rdquo; routine was.
amended to male the whole thing compatible with all present
Versions (and maybe future Versions tag?) as NAS-SYS. As. the
author did not posess an assembler of any description (pencil,
Paper, Z80 manual and NAS-SYS &lsquo;N&rsquo;, being the available tools),
and as it was not known where in memory the code would end. up,
Te was decided to make the routines fully relocatable. G.e. Ao
absolute jumps or calls and mo table data containing or
referenced by absolute memory addresses.) This policy of
creating entirely relocatable code was continued throughout
Gevelopment &ndash; conetimas at great personal risk to the author&rsquo;s
mental health. The result is that the final article can be run
at any available memory location without need for re-assembly.

Having created the mechanism to call new commands as if they
were normal NAS-SYS commands, it seemed a shame to stop
Gevelopnent with anly the named file commands present. After
all, there were many useful features that the author had always
hankered after, which could now Be easily tagged on to. NAS-SYS-Besides

letters just begging to be used. All that was now needed was to
weite the routines&rsquo; After a gand deal more head&rdquo; scratching,
many more resns of assembler coated paper and a partially seized
brain, (counting backwards in hes for those relative jumps is
detrimental to health) out popped the frnal version.

<p>
&ldquo;What shall we call thie thing? the author asked himself.
(Taiking to hiaself was &lsquo;now a regular occurrence. &ndash; Total
madness was not far away.)

<p>
&ldquo;SYS-EX&rdquo;, he replied to himself. fhe monitor extension (and
insanity) were complete.
