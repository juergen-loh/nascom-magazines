On completing the wiring, 1 suggest powering up the smulator
board without any chips inserted. The supply pins may be checked
at this stage af each IC socket for correct polarity. The chips
may then be inserted one af a time whilst&rsquo; monitoring supply
Current for excessive drain.

A cable may be made up with a 16 pin header to connect to
SKT 1 at one end and an appropriate connector for ports A and B
of the Nascom, in my Case a Canon type. The connection diagram
shows the pin numbers for direct connection to the two 16 pin
headers on a Nascom&nbsp;1. Finally, you can put the whole thing in a
box if you want to be slick

Using the Emulator.
</p>
<p>
Being simple-minded, I tend to use one extremely basic
loader routine which transfers a 2K block of RAN from the Nascom
to the emulator. The routine is relocatable but resides in ROM
at address D42F which happens to be convenient in my systee. The
Foutine is so basic that, as it stands, the data to be
transferred must reside at aBdress 4000H in the Nascom memory.
Tt would be easy enough to pick up an extra parameter with
Nas-Sys E command to improve this...
</p>
<p>
The following table gives the functions of the emulator
contrel lines, driven by the lower five bits of Port A, which is
Configured as&rsquo;an output port at all times. Port B is &lsquo;used for
data transfer and must &ldquo;be configured for output only when
leading data, otherwise it is left set up for input.

<p>
Control Lines
</p>
<p>
Port A bit Name Function
&lsquo; SWITCH Enables access by host when HIGH
1 ADCLK A low to high transition on this line
advances IC 1&rsquo;s count by one
2 &lsquo;ADRES @ high level on this line resets IC
1
3 re Write Enable for the RAM, active low
4 cs Chip. Select for RAM. Note active
HIGH
</p>
<p>
Port B bits @ to 7 are connected to data bits &copy; to 7 of the
emulator respectively.
</p>
<p>
To load the eaulator, the program must generate the
following sequence:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
1. Port A is configured as an output.
2. The RAM is deselected and a Reset applied to ADRES.
3. SWITCH must be HIGH to put the computer in control
4, Pointers are set to indicate the starting address of
the data to be transferred and the number of bytes
(normally 2K or 800H).
