Introduction.
</p>
<p>
This article describes the design and construction of @ unit
of hardware intended to temporarily replace an EPROM during the
developesent and debugging of firmware for dedicated Z80 CPU
based projects. Detail is given to allow the construction of a
unit, ineluding an example of a loading program in 760 ateeabler
code, and connections to a Nascom, The article is also intended
to act as a basis for experigent for anyone who&rdquo; might wisi to
extend the design.

Design Considerations.
</p>
<p>
My own computer interests lie in the application of
micropracessors to small design projects, often eaploying a 760
CPU plus minimal RAM and EPROM configurations. A single 2714
EPROM is often enough for the whole program, ie. 2048 (2K)
bytes. A Nascom plus and EPROM programmer (such as the Gemini
one) makes quite a fair development system. However, when
testing a newly built piece of hardware (or a &ldquo;target&rdquo; system,
as it le known) it can be necessary to repeatedly blow and erase
EPROMS to find faults and debug the program. What is required is
2 chunk of memory which will Jook like an EPROM to the target
system, but to which a host computer can read and write quickly.
This would then replace the EPROM until program development is
complete.
</p>
<p>
Several such emulators are commercially available, but tend
to be expensive, as they incorporate their om&rsquo; aonitors,
keyboards and displays. The Nascom, though, already hay its ow
powerful machine code facilities, so this design relies entirely
on the Nascom to manipulate the data, resulting in a very simple
(7 common 1sTTL chips) design, at, perhaps, the cost of a little
Flexibiliey,
</p>
<p>
The device is controlled from a Z80 PIO, in this case, ports
A and B of a Nascom&nbsp;1, although, of course, other ports may be
used.
</p>
<p>
As dram, the emulator plugs in directly in place of the
single supply rail 2716 EPROM, although it could he extended to
2732 devices by adding extra RAM and decoding. Components are
hot criticals higher density RAM packages such as the 6116 have
becose available since the prototype was bullt and could be
worth looking at.
