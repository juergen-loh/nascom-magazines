Gener-B0 Review

<p>
Gener-00 is a 200-Asseabler/Editor package for the Nascom
from Seven Stars Publishing. The package is supplied on tape
along with an AS photocopied &ldquo;manual which, although net
Comprehensive, is adequate.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The program is 475K long and the copy I was sent loaded
with only a slight volume adjustment to my recorder. The minimum
system requirements are a Naccom (1 or 2). with Nas-Sys. and
Cottis Blandford equivalent interface and 6K or mare RAM
Starting from 1000H. A 300 baud copy is also supplied on the
tape. The program 1oads at 1000H which means that there are no
problems transferring it to disc. When executed, the program
does a self-check and if all is OK it comes up with a sign-on
message and proceeds to ask about workspace. The manual is not
very clear about how to define your workspace size. You need to
define a source (SCE) area and an object (OBJ) area. The purpose
of this is to restrict the code to these areas. The source area
can be anywhere in menory that is RAM and does not overlap with
Gener-90 or the object area. Likewise for the object area. The
manual gives the example of &pound;000 &pound;0FF for the source area which
gives the impression that it is purely workspace for temporary
Storage etc. In practice it is the source code area and
therefore wants to be as big as possible in most cases. Likewise
for the object area.
</p>
<p>
Once these have been designated, you are asked for an
offset. This is used during assembly in&rsquo; the expected way to
&lsquo;offset&rsquo; the object cod
</p>
<p>
Once the program is happy with these values, you are
presented with a menu.!-
