seem unnecessary, but the wrong type setting is likely to
Gestroy the EPROM when the 25 volt supply is switched on by the
transistors so be warned!

It helps if the two diodes are of the Shotky variety to keep
the volt drop down but the five transistors are not critical
provided that they are rated for 25 volts or above and can pass
the charging current af @.1 MFD capacitor required by the 2752.

The 25 volt source is not specified as 1t may be convenient
to find an available stabilised power unit for occasional use.
Fig. 3 shows a simple regulator which will accept anything
between 26 and 50 volts, giving out 25 volts at up to S0aa
continuously. It would be suitable for a well smoothed voltage
doubler from one of the transformer windings on the Nascom power

RAM storage is required at locations @C8i to CBA inclusive
for addresses, byte count and EPROM type,
