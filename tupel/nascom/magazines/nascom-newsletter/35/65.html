&lsquo;The editor mode may be entered either just with E or 8
followed by a string. Movement about the source file is via the
cursor keys and various combinations of control keys to move
formard and backward by lines, pages and the complete text.
Lines and characters may obviously be deleted and inserted.
Points that I found un-natural were that only text on a line up
to the cursor were entered and if a line began with a space, an
error was flagged and the cursor disappears which looks
remarkably like = program crash. It was only after frantic
irching of the manual that I found that CS has to be typed
fore you get a cursor back after an error is flagged.

As mentioned previously, each line of source must begin in
character position 1 which means that the listing Jooks, in my
Opinion, a bit untidy and not too clear-The
Dielete), Mfove), Piprint source), PA(sseabled source)
and Stave to tape) commands all allow the use of optional labels
which enable only sections of the source to be worked on. A very
Useful touch for the print and save commands.

The assembler handles all the Z8@ nmenonics plus the usual
DEFB, DEFH, DEFS, DEFM, END, EGU and ORG. Labels are up to 6
alphanunerics starting witha letter and must be followed by a
colon and a space. Numbers are either decimal or hex (preceded
by &pound;) and are equated to 16 bits.

Gener-60 is cassette based and consequently all text is
loaded/saved to tape. No technical data is given in. the manual
to help anyone who wanted to make the asseebler disc based. It
is also set up for the default Nascom serial printer but, at
explained in the manual, it goes via C78 so can easily be
intercepted and re-directed to your own print routine.
</p>
<p>
All in all Gener-go is an adequate assembler package. It
does not go for any of the fancy frills like acros etc but as
fan assembler it does its job well. I think that more technical
information is needed for it in this day and age ta make it
easier for people to patch in their own routines for additional
pseudo-mnenonics and I/O. All in all, siaple but adequate.

Gener-80 is available fron Seven Stars Publishing who hail
