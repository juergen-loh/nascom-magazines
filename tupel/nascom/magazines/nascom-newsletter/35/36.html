The last change is the major change and comes about because
of the different ways that the asseablers keep track of things.

&lsquo;The Nas-Dis routine ALLINO is next copied from CCBC to cc74
land the following code entered. This writes the end of source
code address to the screen and puts the cursor up tno lines so
that when NEWLINE is pressed after initiating Vu T, the
assenbler is ready to 90.

The version of V &amp; 7 that I have was produced before Nas-Sys
3 was introduced. Because of this, it suffers from not being
able to print the work areas on the top line while running under
Nas-Sys. If you would like to display these work areas on the
top line then the following small modifications should be made.
</p>
<p>
When V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T is initially loaded, the 2DH bytes of the Nas-Sys
table at 20AE need to be copied to 207E. Copy only 27H bytes to
2@7E and, as this leaves the Nasbug calls in the sane place, the
work areas can be printed on the top line.
</p>
<p>
Because V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T jumps directly to the &lsquo;WRITE&rsquo; subroutine in
</p>
<p>
Nas-Sys instead of through the SCAL routine, the jump address at
209C needs to be changed to OsFB.
