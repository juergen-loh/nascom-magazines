Incidently, 1 you read the May 1981 copy of Personal
Computer World&rsquo; there 15 a very good description of impLementing
a Mini-DCR on a NASCOM, which led, I believe, to the C.I-E.L.
System. One of the reasone why this system is so dear is the use
ef an 5.1.0. and an B*xa&rdquo; P.C-B. mith 2k RAM.
</p>
<p>
On initialisation a pointer to the systen&rsquo;s command table is
written to 0CB0H, OCAIN (a slightly inconvenient address, I&rsquo;ve
moved mine to immediately belom the tape system buffer), mhich
means that you can set up your ow command table and expand the
&ldquo;HOBBIT&rdquo; monitor toa full system monitor. The manual explains
how to set i your ann command table, and this feature, together
with the information on the addresses and routines within
SHOBBIT&rdquo; mate the aystem extremely #lecible and easy to&rdquo; expand.
OF course it would be alot easier if that source code was
</p>
<p>
available...
</p>
<p>
As mentioned warlier I have found the system very reliable.
However, the price of the mni-cassettes is a bit off-putting at
about &pound;3 each for the Philips certified tapes, so I&rsquo;ve tried
Tots of different makes of dictating tapes, ail with complete
success. The cheapest, so far, from Dixons is &pound;1-23.&rdquo; One
dranback i that they are longer than the Philips tapes. This
does not increase the amount of storage but does increase the
time it can take to Mount a tape as considered earlier. Another
is that the tapes require a &ldquo;write-enable&rdquo; plug, and these are
hat supplied with dictation tapes.
</p>
<p>
So far I have said nothing about the file-handling facility
in BASIC. The &ldquo;HOBBIT&rdquo; system itself does not support thie, but
IKON sell, for an extra &pound;10, a &ldquo;Microsost BASIC Upgrade Kit",
which is &ldquo;a cassette (for the Mini-DCR) (not forgetting the
Cassette itself 15 worth &pound;5) containing 4 different versions of
routine to add full. :le handling routines, One. routine each
for Nas&nbsp;Sys&nbsp;1 mith either tape or ROM BASIC, and repeated. again
for Nas-Sys&nbsp;3. In this case the old monitors are not supported
(is there anyone still. using. them). Also, generously, the
source code is included, (in ZEAP format), &ldquo;for it to be
individually adapted.
</p>
<p>
The facilaties provided are (from the command made of BASIC,
or within a program :- Select a drive Ge. supporting a. 2-drive
system. Open a named file for writing ta, Writing &laquo; string of
Up to 8) characters to a file, Closing a file, Open&rdquo; a named
file for reading and finally Getting a line of text froma
file. Error trapping includes an &ldquo;x&rdquo; legend to. denote =
different error from the ones described above, which are also
Supported. The error code 15 followed by the program Line number
where the error orcurs.

<p>
This program aise works quite well, 1ts only restrictions
