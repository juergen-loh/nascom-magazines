disabled with the Nas-sys &lsquo;N&rsquo; command). If the relevant options
are set, the printed output will now appear mith a. title and
Therementing page number. This produces a nice Visual effect
from the program listings.

wath Zeap and Naspen, everything typed at the keyboard is
not echoed to the printer. The command to print must be given
before output commences.

Nasprint is a very handy piece of software for use with
Nas-sysy Nasdis, Debug and Zeap, but it is with Naspen that it
really scores. In the days before Nasprint, I found Naspen to be
a fairly useful wordprocessor but it was impossible to utilize
S11 of the special print modes available on the Epson. Nasprint
Changed this because it allows special printer contral codes to
be embedded into the text. Codes between &lsquo;&lt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; are
intercepted by Nasprint and are nat sent dsrectly to the
printer: The special codes which can be embedded in the Naspen
Nouree text are:
</p>
<p>
&copy; &ndash; centre the Iine
</p>
<p>
D &ndash; double line spacing
</p>
<p>
H &ndash; hold (stops printing unti1 any key i= pressed. Useful for
</p>
<p>
changing paper in the printer when using single sheets?
</p>
<p>
Lower = changes Tine Tength to se
</p>
<p>
Mojoot &ndash; changes margin width to. s00
</p>
<p>
N soe = changes page number to oor
</p>
<p>
Ox yy s. ++ &gt; Outputs Hex codes xx, yy, etc directly to the
printer (useful for turning on/off double
Midth, enhanced, condensed, etc. printing
nodes)
</p>
<p>
P &ndash; finishes off current page with spaces and starts a new
S &ndash; sets single Line spacing
</p>
<p>
If invalid codes are used Nasprint will detect them and
print an error code.
</p>
<p>
ALL in all Nawprint 80 12 an extremely versatile printer
facility for anyone using a &lsquo;Nascom and. printer. Together,
Nasprint and Naspen form a really good wordprocessing package. f
have used it to print all of my Letters and reports since 1
inetalled it and have been very pleased with the results,
