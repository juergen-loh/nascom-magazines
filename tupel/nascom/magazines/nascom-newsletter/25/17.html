The Competition
</p>
<p>
Microcode, in conjunction with Micro Power, are offering the
readers of the Nascom Newsletter the chance to see their pet
hardware idea incorporated into a marketable product. Most
Nascom enthusiasts have some pet project that they would like to
nee on the market. This i= your chance to make that&rdquo; dream come
true. Ideas wubmitted may consist of anything from a scribbled
note to a fully working prototype. You do not need to be an
electronic whife kid to enter. ALL you need to submit is your
Idea, whether it is for 2 65 bit processor or 4 256 colour video
card, anything goes. Obviously, the @ore detail you give us, the
better your winning chances in the case of a draw. The only
necessity is that the idea is Nas-bus/80-bus compatibl
</p>

The competition will be judged by Micro Power, Microcode and
an independent judge, and the prizes will be awarded to the most
Ingenious and of iginal designs.
