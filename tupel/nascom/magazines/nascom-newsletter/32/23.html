easier to use. The present generation of computers is much more
&lsquo;user friendiy&rsquo;, enabling almost anyone to becose a computer
user. This continuing improvement in the man-machine (person&mdash;
machine?) interface can only serve to widen the acceptance of
computers in everyday life,
</p>
<p>
The advent of the personal computer has made it possible for
problems to be solved which would previously have been
prohibitively expensive to solve by means of computers.
However, the cost of computing is not the ondy obstacle to
acceptance of computers, particularly in the area of the parson
machine interface.
</p>
<p>
The solutions to the person-computer interface problem are now
becoming more readily available &ndash; colour graphics and speech
being areas which offer the most promise. Speech simulation is
already available for the Nascom range cf computers, although
reliable speech recognition is still some way off. The ability
to communicate to the computer user complex or simple results
has always been a problem in the past, but now that high-quality
colour graphica displays are available this hurdle can be
crossed.
</p>
<p>
Colour graphice enables the computer to present information
pictortally, which greatly improves the usability of programs.
Sometimes information is difficult or impossible to present
using only numbers and words, but becomes easily comprehensible
in graphica form. Even computer output which dows not require
colour graphics to be usable will usually become clearer when
converted to colour. The use of high-quality colour graphics is
row open to all users, enabling business, scientific,
engineering and other users to gain maximum efficiency.
</p>
<p>
The addition of quality colour graphica to the Nascom range of
computers is achieved by means of the Advanced Video Controller
(AVC). Equally important to the effective implementation of
colour graphice is comprehensive and easy to &lsquo;support
software, and this is provided

NAS-DOS and CP/M users.

The principles of displaying &laquo; graphics picture are transparent
to the user, but to gain &laquo; better understanding an insight into
the theory of graphics in general will be useful.

<p>
character generator (PCG) systems can offer faster graphics
generation of a linted range of character shapes, they suffer
severely from programming difficulties and&rsquo; the lack of
generality of the pictures that they can represent. Normally
they are limited to only 128, or possibly 256, special
characters.
