In addition to just specifying a single colour (one of the @ight
already aentioned) the AVC allows the use of special shading
</p>
<p>
which can be used to differentiate areas such a= grapha oF
in pictures. These shading colours are specified to the
Computer as the relative levels of the three primary components of
colour (red, green and blue), allowing a selection of 4915 different
colours.

This command has two functions &ndash; to select the combination of
primary colours which are available for drawing purposes (as

can be drawn as they would be with coloured pens on paper, but they
can also be draw in other ways. These other ways produce effects
jinich change the shapes appearance and colour. The effects are
Sinilar to television visual effects,
