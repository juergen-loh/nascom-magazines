How it wor!

<p>
A SOHe clock signal derived from Tpz2 on the Nascom&nbsp;2 board is
connected to port A bit 7 of the PIO. The PIO is configured by the
software to generate an interrupt when the edge of this clock pulse
ia received. The 260 {s set to use interrupt mode 2, in which mode
an interrupt results in transfer of control to a location the
address of which is located in menory at an address given by the
contents of the interrupt register and data placed on the bus by the
interrupting devics
</p>
<p>
At initialisation the PIG 2s configured for output on port B and
bits 1 to 4 of port Ay and input on port @ bits O and 7. This
allows a clock input to be used on port A bit 7, and algo prepares
the ports for parallel printer use, thus eliminating any need to
configure ports in parallel printer drivers, which might othernise
Upset the clock input during their configuration process. Control
Signals are also sent to the PIO so that it will generate an
appropriate address and an interrupt when an edge occurs on the
clock input of port A bit 7.
</p>
<p>
The interrupt routine and ite workspace and buffer ares are located
at the top of mesory &ndash; C800 in this case. When an interrupt occurs
the interrupt routine scans the keyboard via the normal NAS-SYS
routines, and places any data found in the buffer.
</p>
<p>
To insert the new keyboard input routing inte NAS-BYS the entire
SCAL table is copied into RAM, and the vector at OC71 which points
to the table is modified accordingly. The keyboard input entry in
the table is then changed to point to the new input routine, which
inspects the keyboard buffer to see if there has been any input.
</p>
<p>
Some aystens programs use a similar method of moving the GCAl table
te RAN and then perform their onn changes to it. Such programs (eg
NAS-SEMBLER) should therefore not be run with the keyboard buffering

in operation.

any program which disables interrupt will inhibit use of the
keyboard, so be very careful! In particular you need to avoid cold
starting&rsquo; BASIC, which for some incomprehensible reason disables
interrupt. You&rsquo;can conveniently circumvent this by loading an empty
BASIC program from tape or disc and then using the normal Z to ware
start. &ldquo;This method has the added advantage that you can reserve the
hecessary space at the top of memory when you save this empty file,
and you will then not need to remenber the memory size when starting
BASIG in the future. You should first J BASIC in the waual way
(ui thout loading these routines, of course), and specify 51200
memory available. then use the CSAVE"B&rdquo; command to save tl
workapace, which can then be Joaded via an R command in future.
BASIC can&rsquo;the be &lsquo;cold&rsquo; started by the Z command. As only one block
needs to be stored on tape this is still a quick operation. Next
month we will mention an even faster solution! NAS-DOS users can of
course save this enpty file with a command JB:BASIC, and then simply
type JE:BASIC to &lsquo;cold&rsquo; start BASIC.
</p>
<p>
To avoid the danger of accidentally cold starting BASIC we have
eliminated the J command in the SCAL table in RAM. NAG-DOS users
