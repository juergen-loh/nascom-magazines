<p>
After deletion of the specified byte, the command
responds by displaying on the following screen line the
hexadecimal value of the deleted byte,
</p>
<p>
AAAA &ndash; memory address at mhich the byte is to be deleted
B= top limit for move. Memory addresses from this
address upwards are not accessed.

<p>
The conaand uses the 260 block transfer instruction LDIR
to shift the contents of senory downwards.

character or, if this is not present, the end of the line.
2. Sequence of bytes pacified by hexadecimal valu
</p>
<p>
The mask is entered al sequence of simple byte
hexadecimal numbers (G to FF), each one separated from the
next by at Jeast one apace. The first value may start in the
firat position on the line or may De preceded by as many
spaces as are required, The entire find mask must be contained
within a single Line.

After entry of the mask, memory is searched from the
specified start address up to the top end of memory (FFFFH).
The response is always displayed on the screen line following
the entered mask. If no match is found, the response {5 XXxxX.
