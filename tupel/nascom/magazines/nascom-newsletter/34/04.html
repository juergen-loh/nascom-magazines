appears on the next screen line and the required program nane is
entered. The action of the comand im identical to the READ
NAMED PROGRAM FILE command, with the exception that the required
program is NOT loaded into mesory. The comand is used to check
that a program file may be successfully read from cassette tape.
</p>
<p>
SEARCH FOR TAPE LABEL &ndash; USR(2)
</p>
<p>
Read a cassette tape and search for # tape label as written
by the SYS-EX &ldquo;I&rdquo; command. Display the first label found on the
top line ef the screen then terminate the commend.
</p>
<p>
The command may be used for positioning &laquo; tepe
prior to using the WRITE NAMED PROGRAM FILE command. The tape
drive LED is switched on between entry of the command and
command termination. If a tape label is not found, the command
nay be terminated by first stopping the cassette
and then typing four ESC) (GHIFTIENTER) ch
consecutive ESC characters read from the cassette tape recorder
will have the sane effect.
</p>
<p>
WRITE NAMED PROGRAM FILE &ndash; USR(S) (CSAVE equivalent?
</p>
<p>
Weite the BASIC program currently in memory to cassette
tape. The program is preceded bye file label containing the
Specified progras name, The file label will be recagnised and
Gisplayed in full by the SYS-EX commands &ldquo;a&rdquo;, "r"_ and &ldquo;v&rdquo; in
addition to the WRITE and VERIFY NAMED PROGRAM FILE commands.
The BAGICs CLOAD and CLOAD? commands ill also recognise the
file label, but will use and display only the first character of
the program name.
</p>
<p>
After entry of the UGR(S) statement, the prompt
wNamer
</p>
<p>
appears on the next screen line and the name of the program to
be written is entered on that line. The tape drive LED is then
auitched on and, after # short delay, the file label followed by
the file iteelf&rsquo;is sent to the serial output port for mriting to
tape. Finally, the tape drive LED i awitched off.
</p>
<p>
NB.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to escape from the above commands while the
file name prompt is displayed on the scr#en. (ie, rNamer&nbsp;, vNaner
+ Waser) To do this, backspace over the promt or move the
Cursor to another line before pressing ENTER, An error message
wil] be produced, but no harm will be done.
</p>
<p>
RETURNING TO SYB-EX FROM BASIC
</p>
<p>
Tt 4s useful to have an equivalent of the HONITOR command
which, instead of returning solely to NAS-GYS, returns to SYS-EX
so that the full range of NAS-SYS and SYS-EX &lsquo;keyboard commands
