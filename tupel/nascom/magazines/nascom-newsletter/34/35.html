best known of these is the UCSD system, = particular feature of which
ia to maximise the portability of software between different
computers. UCSD can be run on a number of much larger computer
systems at well as on le and @ bit microcomputers, which illustrates
its flensbility.
</p>
<p>
UCSD is most frequently referred to with its implemetation of the
Pascal programming language, but in fact other languages such as BASIC
and Fortran are also available. A certain amount of applications
Software is also available.

UCSO has been implemented on the Nascom by Mike York, and we have
recently taken delivery of a copy. UCSD is completely new to me, and
the previously mentioned shortage of time has prevented any serious
usage yet. Honever, it looks very interesting and I look forward to
Using &ldquo;1t&rdquo; and commenting again in the future. Initial reactions are
that it is very different trom the other operating systees on the
Nascom, and requires rather a lot of disc grinding to get started! It
38 quite easy to install &ndash; replace NAS-SYS (or the CP/M boot EPROM)
with Mike&rsquo;s ingenious ALLBOOT EPROM, fit a CP/M MD PROM and header (if
hot already fitted) and away you go. You can also run it in a
switchable system with NAS-DUS using the switch unit described abovt
A drawback tor some users will be the price &ndash; typically several
hundree pounds tor the operating system and a language.

IHE MANOR DATABASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
</p>
<p>
MANOR 18 a versatile, low cost data management program designed to run
with computers titted with the NAS-DOS operating system. In the 18
months or so of its use it has proved one of the most popular of the
NAS-DOS applications programs &ndash; perhaps because there are so many uses
tor a program of this type. The current release is Rev 6, and all
registered omers should have a copy ot this version, since a free
Update service ie included covering a 1 month period. If you. nave
not. received the update, and you have registered the product, please
write in giving the serial number, date and place of purchase.
Although &ldquo;our&rdquo; system should catch&rsquo; those who register the earlier
Versions atter the release of the new one, it does occasionally fail
to do so.
</p>
<p>
Une bug has been reported in the HINIUN initialisation program of the
current Rev of MANOR. This only atfects the CHange option when this
is used to swap the fields round so that the first (or key) field is
</p>
<p>
changed. The fix for this bug has the rather nice feature that not
only does it now work (1 hope!) but it is shorter and faster than the
original. To make the corrections type the following:
