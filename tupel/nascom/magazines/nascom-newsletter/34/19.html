Double dimensioned arrays are not supported but...
A=USR(@) ,DDS (1,1) ,50,1,12,5
</p>
<p>
Wi11 sort the array from DDs(1,1) to DDS(S&reg;,1) without reference
to any other dimensions. ie. the elements DDs(1,2) to DDS(52,2)
will remain in their previous sequence. Perhaps BruteSort &lsquo;IT
Sill &ldquo;properly support milti-dimensioned arrays but I can
Visualise the 1000 element sort dragging on for quite a bit
Tonger mith that enhancement.

<p>
The penalty paid for having auch brief cade is that there t
no validation of the parameters and it&rsquo;s also fussy about syntax
(extra blants, etc. J. [ts up to the BASIC calling program to
check that&rsquo; ail. parameters are within valid range. Another
limitation is that all the elements in the array should have
characters filling the entire sort field Sorting field 1 to. 10
on a 6 character string may have unpredictable results and an
array with a null string in the sort range will most likely get
corrupted.
</p>
<p>
With some more understanding of how BASIC works the routine
could be polished up a bit to remove these restrictions. Who is
going to be first with Suavesort?
