dramatic.

The CP/M disc operating system has generally proved most popular with
those who wish to run standard business applications software. Bath
CP/M and the programs to run with it are generally significantly sore
expensive than the corresponding NAS-DOS versions. A very wide range
OF software is available to use with CP/M from many sources. If you
are buying software from some other source do be careful to ensure
that the disc is supplied in the right format &ndash; most suppliers should
be able to provide Nascom format. A range of the sore popular
softmare is available from oursleves through the usual dealers, and
this is of course in the correct format and will normally also have

Sorcim have recently released a new and tapraved version of Supercalc
&mdash;"Supercalc 2. This contains a number of improvements over the
previous version, and a new manual is provided. This is @ much larger
manual than&rdquo; previously, and sore thought seems to have gone into its
structure. Overall a worthwhile improvement to what was already an
extremely fine product.

MicroPro have also re-vamped their products, with Wordstar Release
3.30 and corresponding MailMerge and Spellstar programs. New
documentation here too, properly printed at last and very methodically
and well laid. out although I don t feel the &lsquo;cartoons&rsquo; really add
anything of value. The total volume of the documentation is rather
alarming, particularly $4 you get Reportstar and Datastar at the same
time! AIL the manuals are in the same, AS (half AA) size, and ere in
cloth bound ring binders in cloth bound card sleeves &ndash; very lapressive
in appearance. @ new product to me is StarIndex which was included in
the documentation. This locked = very good may of preparing indexes,
