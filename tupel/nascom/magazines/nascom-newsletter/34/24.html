About software standarde
1) T am weiting in response to your plea for comments on Mr.
O&rsquo;Farrell article rerstandardised extensions to Nes-Sys. i
agree entirely with hie motives in praviding atandard calls for
</p>
<p>
jd-ons but I would Ifke to suggest a fen alterations to his
achene
</p>
<p>
2) Graphic boards
Rather than separate SCAL cally for line, circle, etc.,
</p>
<p>
would it not be better to use one Stel GRAF and load &lsquo;up the
</p>
<p>
arguments and/or registers?
</p>
<p>
b) Floating Point Handling
</p>
<p>
Whilst floating point routines have been published in many
</p>
<p>
places, ble to everyan
</p>
<p>
-Bys should include floating
point arithmetic and functions as well as perhaps extended
Precision integers. Jn doing this ie will turn Sye into @
&ldquo;goftware bus&rdquo; onto which can be tacked all manner of language
and arithmetic applications.
8) Nas-5ys (COM) Naughti
</p>
<p>
Many moons aga, in the days when Zeei&rsquo;s werent around,
there was an article in INMC (issue Sor &amp; T think) entitled
</p>
<p>
-Bys Naughties&rsquo;. The purpose of if was to ward. off people
ng direct calls to Nas-Sys as they had done with the
Buga. May I now suggest ancther naughty &ndash; Direct Keyboard
Seana!!!
</p>
<p>
Many gangs programs and certain languages, ie BASIC and BLS
Pascal, scan the keyboard directly. (BLS Pascal even makes @
direct &lsquo;call to Nas-Bya). Thie practice is all very well and good
on a Nascom but it is perfectly possible to run Sys on a Gemini
by fudging the video RAN (see Richard Beal&rsquo;s program in 8@-Bus
News).
</p>
<p>
50; in conclusion, I would repeat my wish that Sys should act as
2 &lsquo;noftware bus&rsquo; running the &lsquo;hardware bus&rsquo; we all know.

2) The proposal by Hr. O&rsquo;Farrell in the Nascom Newsletter Vol-3,
No.1 was a very good ides. A lot of people have already added
new routines to their Nas-Sys. I know that Polydos uses ite own
set of new routine numbers and I think that Nasdos dows the
same. It would be nice if we could get some standard out of it.
</p>
<p>
But I think that there is another problem. Where in memory
should these extra routines be placed? Gomenhere in the top of
memory most people would say, but I think that this is only half
2 solution. Why not place the whole moniter on another page?
This is what Ihave done. Nas-Sys is placed on GBQS EPROM
board cbut I think that it should be a simple matter to modify
the CPU-board such that it could be paged in and out). The
monitor pages itself in and out when Nes-Sys routines are
