Discs and Ports on a Nascom&nbsp;1

<p>
When installing the Nascoa F.0.C. card or any asseably using
an off-board P.1.0. on a Nascom i, you will find that the
on-board P.1.0. will no longer function. This is because the
decoding for selecting ports 0 to 3 (keyboard and UART) from
ports 4 to 7 (P.1,0.) relied on the I/O select link being wired
to TINT? which is actually a2.
</p>
<p>
Once the I/O select 15 moved to &ldquo;EXT&rdquo;, which is actually
NasI0, the address line a2 is disconnected and the port decoding
As incomplete, causing any reference to ports 4 to 7 to be
directed to ports 0 to 3 respectively.
</p>
<p>
If the P.1.0. was in use prior to the addition of discs then
the only advice that Nascom can offer is that you buy a P.T.0.
board, not a very economic method of sorting out this simple
problem. There follows a method that will solve the port
decoding problem for approx. 20p plus labour.
</p>
<p>
Parts Required.
1x 74LS02 Quad NOR Gate
3% lengths of wire 30cm Long
</p>
<p>
Documentation.
Nascom&nbsp;1 circuit sheet 1
</p>
<p>
Method.
1. Locate IC 48 (7aLS00)
2. Remove, bend out pin 2, replace.
3. Take 74LS02, bend sideways all pins except pins 1,741)
41 Solder 74/502 on top of 74L500 using pins 7 and 14.
5. Bend pin 1 of 74L502 to join pin 2 of 74LSO0.
6. Solder these two pins.
7. Remove link on I/O select completely.
@. Connections to 741502 are as follows:
</p>
<p>
pin 10 to pin 11
</p>
<p>
pin Ztopin 4
</p>
<p>
pin 2 to pin 8 to I/O select &lsquo;ExT&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
pin Stopin 9 to I/O select &ldquo;INT?
</p>
<p>
pin 13 to I/O select &lsquo;COM&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
Ground from pin 7 to pin &amp; and pin 12
</p>
<p>
Once the wiring changes have been made, all that needs to be
</p>
<p>
done is to reassemble and test.
</p>
<p>
Testing.
Using the NAS-SYS commands &lsquo;O&rsquo; and &lsquo;O&rdquo;, type the following:
1.06 OF Initialise port A as an output.
</p>
<p>
2:0 7 OF Initialise port B as an output.
</p>
<p>
5.04.55 Send SSH to port A.
