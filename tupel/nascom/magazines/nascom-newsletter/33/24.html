NEWS FROM NASCOM
</h1>
<p>
This month&rsquo;s news is being written in the middle of the first
really good weather of the year &ndash; ac it&rsquo;s a bit shorter than it
</p>
<p>
would have been otherwise!
</p>
<p>
On the new product front we have news of the LX60 printer &ndash; 2
low cost 80 character per line, BO characters per second printer
for use with the parallel interface.
</p>
<p>
The specification of the NAS-CAD computer aided drawing package
has grown considerably since our last report, so although =
brief outline of the features is given this month you will need
to wait for next aonth&rsquo;s newsletter for full detai
</p>
<p>
We have more information on using disc files under NAS-DOS who
find the aanual rather terse (it is!). This will be continued
in the next Nascoa Mews when we will also give more information
on the operation of the MANOR database manager, which makes,
extensive use of data files.
</p>
<p>
The addition of soft function keys at zero cost has been held
over to next month &ndash; no problems in that we already use it
ourselves, but there has not been tiwe to prepare an article tor
this newsletter.

1, APPEAL FOR INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE
</p>
<p>
Nascom users are exceptionally ingenious, but unfortunately they
are also very reticent about what they use their machines for.
We are often asked by potential customers &ldquo;Has anyone else used
2 Nascom to.....-...7. Although we often believe that it has
been done we don"t have a specific contact. It would help us a
lot to be able to comile a directory of users/ applications/
software, and by publishing this we could put you in touch with
other users with similar interests, and perhaps save pecple re-inventing
the wheel by writing software which already exists.
It could help you make money too &ndash; as we may be interested in
buying some software ourselves, or contacts you make may be
willing to pay, oF Swap other software.
</p>
<p>
If you want to take part in this scheme send us a note of your
application, hardware configuration and softnare and how you can
be contacted. We would be particularly interested to hear about
educational software and NAS-DOS utility programs. The. latter
could be put into a library, or added to the existing utilities,
disc.

1f you have a particularly interesting application you might
