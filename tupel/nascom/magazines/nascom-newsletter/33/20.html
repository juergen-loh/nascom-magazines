The least useful operation af the WAIT &ndash; GATE is with both
ROM and RAM of either c 275ns or &gt; 525ns access time. The most
Useful arrangement is with ROM of &lt; 400ns and RAM of &lt; 275NS-To
give results. for the test programs given in the manual,
over the full range of ROM and RAM set ups would take up a Jot
of Space and reading time. So Twill give results for only one

<p>
arrangement, which T think is the most frequently used today.

To summerise. 1 found the WAIT &ndash; GATE a verv useful time
saving device. Tt had only one noticable side effect which wax
</p>

increased programming speed (mhich can&rsquo;t be toa bad!) Finally,
the most remarkable aspect for me, was the price Phildata are
asting for this piece of hardware, wet &pound;7.95. all inclusive.

T should like to thank tir. D. Johnson of Phildata for oroviding
the WAIT &ndash; GATE for review. and assisting mith my questions,
