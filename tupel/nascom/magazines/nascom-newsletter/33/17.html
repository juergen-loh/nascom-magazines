&ldquo;The HSA.88E floating-point arthmetc processor s

arctangent executes in only 2500 microseconds. A
large number of 16/32 bit integer and floating-point
fanetons from x+y to 97&rsquo;s accesible with simple
smgle byte commands, All accesses o the HSA-B8B,
are va two l/O ports iselectable from 80H to F0H)
</p>
<p>
The HSA-8B is tre simultaneous co-processor
capable of performing one operation whie your Z80,
CPU is doing something eke. Ths ideally suted to
animated graphics where the CPU the HSA-S8B,
and the graphics card can perform thet functions a
the highest possible speed
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The HSA-88B is easiy used from within assembly
language progrems. High level language programs
</p>
<p>
require a compler wth modified run-time routines,
We are oflerng with every HSA-B8B o FREE latest
Hisoft HPS Pascal compiler which hasbeen special
adapted to compile HSA-S8B-onented code. This
&lsquo;omplerisaleadly extremely ast and withthe HSA-&lsquo;B&amp;B t
ourperforms all other Z80 Pascal comps, In
&lsquo;many cases by an order of maghitide The standard
Pascal variabe types plus 32 bt integers (deal for
financial applications) are supported together wih 2
fullrange of maths functions rarely seen in Pascal or
Basics, The sue ofthe run-time routines tsgreaty re
duced over other complers because the HSA-88B
performs the arthmetsc functions is hardware

<p>
The complete package consists of the HSA-888
processor card, HPS compiler on Gemini 5Y
DSDD disk (other formats avalable including
Nascom 54" and IBM 8" SSSD) and HSA 888
and HP5 documentation and programming
