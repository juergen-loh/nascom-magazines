Christmas comes but once a year but 1t looks ap though 1 ve
managed to mish rt with this bumper Christmas issue. Most of the
agazine was put together before Christmas but, unfortunately,
due to circumstances beyond my control, Ge. the Christass
rush), I didn&rsquo;t get chance to get if (iaished and sent out for
Christmas asl had intended. 1 hope you all had a happy
</p>
<p>
Christmac and a very merry New Year.

The results of the survey that I did a couple of issue back
are coming in now and they are giving @e Some idea of what you
Gant to. see in the magarsne. In general they seem very
encouraging but I think I had better clear up a few pointe:
</p>
<p>
1. We are totally seperate from Nascom. Nascom (or rather
Licas Logie) Nave given us there full support. and backing
but Micra Power Ltd Still maintain full editorial control.
The section of the sagazine under &lsquo;Nascoa News&rsquo; is supplied
by Lucas and goes into the magazine unedited in content but
the rest of the magazine 18 made up of a representative
selection of the articles that 1 receive from readers.
</p>
<p>
2. Duite a large percentage of the replies to the survey
</p>
<p>
commented on the unprofessional f2nish to the magazine.
This ts because the magazine. 15 unprofessional. t- would
much rather use a daley wheel printer for printing and have
</p>
<p>
the circu:t diagrams done professionally but this would
invelve expenditure which the magazine could not pay for.
The magazine is produced very much on a voluntary/amat eur
basis sa If any reader has circuit drawing experience. I
would be very happy to make contact with -nim/her and
possibly come up with some working agreement.
</p>
<p>
1 will give you more results of the survey, hopefully, in
the next issue.

Subscriptions.
Thie ts the last issue of Volume 2 of the Nascom
Newsletter /Micropower magazine. This year (1983) { intend to
produce &amp; issues on a regular basis&rdquo; (I am getting properly
Organised) with a more consistant balance of news, reviews,
hints and letters. I am hoping to set up a section for queries
about problems on the the Nasco and related products which T
Gan forward on to the party concerned for a detailed. answer
which Twill be able to print ina subsequent issue. 1 don&rsquo;t
Know af thas will work but T won&rsquo;t know until I have tried.
</p>
<p>
1 am afraid that the cost of the magazine will have ta go up
for Volume Sand the cost now will be &pound;1-25 per issue or &pound;7.50
for a subscription (4 issues) (Europe and Overseas rates are
also increased: see the enclosed subscription form for details?
The magazine NEEDS subscriptions. We are offering a &pound;2 discount
(that works out at 85.50 for 6 inuues of the magazine sent
anywhere in Great Britain) an the subscription if you also order
Some Micro Power software/hardware at the same time, before the
2ist of Feb. re!
