Volume 7 Applications Software for NAS-SYS and NAS-DOS &mdash;
NAS-PEN, SPEX, NAS-CALC, MANOR etc
</p>
<p>
Volume 8 Applications software for CP/M &ndash; FINAS, FMS 80,
Calestar, Wordstar etc
</p>

DF these manuals the whole of volume 1 is completely new
except for the NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 manual, Which is merely a reprint using
daisy wheel printer. Inalmost all cases the manuals, will be.
typed using a darsy wheel printer wiih a standard type face
(prestige elite at 1? characters per inch, 70. characters per
Hine). So far the MANOR and NAS-CALC maniials have also been
reprinted in the standard format, anc gthers will follow in due
Course. NAS-DOS will probably be the next&rsquo; to&rdquo; be tackled, and
will involve re-witing some sections Incidentally most of the
januals are now being prepared weing the SPEX word&rdquo; processor.
NAS-PEN will continue to be avarlable and 1% a super word
processcr for its size, but for the NAS-DOS owner SPEX dees have
Sumber of advantages (see the nest vection&rsquo;).

2._NAS-DOS &ndash; Pascal and SPEX
NAS DOS 18 our own low cost disc operating system, and 15
compatitie with all Our NAS-SYS software &ndash; ROM BASIC, NAS-FEN,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;ear, NOS-DIS ang Pascal. In addition we are adding new
applications software to increase the versatility of the
machine. All this software is priced very modestly, and
</p>
<p>
therefore we think that for many users with a Irmited&rdquo; budget,
NAS-DOS t= an attractive proposition compared mith CP/M. AL the
moment we have already released NAS-CALC (a spread sheet
program) and MANOR (a data base manager).

SPEX is 4 ponertul word processor package intended for the
disc user. It 1 loaded into KAM, and occupies about 12K. It 15,
hot intended asa replacement for NAG-PEN, which with ite.
Compact size and availability on EPROM is particularly suited to.
the cassette user (although as we have said already it can be
used perfectly success#lly mith NAS-D0S). The particular
advantages of SPEX are:
</p>
<p>
Greatly extended editing functions. and NAS-SYS compatible use
</p>
<p>
bf the cursor
</p>
<p>
Improved (and variable within the text) width and margin inset
</p>
<p>
facilities
</p>
<p>
Scrolling via the cursor (it never goes off-screen!)
</p>
<p>
Automatic paging
</p>
<p>
Elimination of the need to perform a formatting operation
</p>
<p>
Generally no need to hyphenate &ndash; and then have to change
</p>
<p>
hyphenation if the text is changed
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the editor asked for this contribution to be
</p>
<p>
produced using NAS-PEN, so on this occassion I have had to go
back to that package. Honever for ease of use most of the new
manuals are prepared using SPEX-
