To begin wath, what is Nasprint-@0 or, ta give it the full
title, Nascam Printer Drive and Formatting Package for the Epson
miG0&rdquo; Basically, 1t is an attempt to direct the printed outputs
from all of the standard Nascom software, eg. NASDIS, ZEAP, etc,
through a common printer drive routine, from which the text or
listings etc. can be printed and formatted into pages as
required. The most important criterium being ease-of-use while
Giving 1t mavimum (lecibility. But, before giving a. detailed
description of what Nasprint a0 can do, it may be of interest to
a number of people to know how the program began&rdquo; and was
Subsequently developed.

<p>
Like many people. I ecnect, who burl their Nascom&nbsp;2

eventually got it working, there was a problem of what to do
with it after the Hartians had finally invaded Earth. I decided
that it mould be worthwhile to equip myselt witha printer and,
as it happened, an Olivetti Te 300 teleprinter came my way. With
small hardware addition to the printer, I was able to wite a
Short program to drive the printer through the Nascom PIO and

Printed, which, incidently, mas different to&rdquo; the garbage that
Mas typed in Still, it was a start In fact, that was the

<p>
Beginning of Nasprint-60, although 1 was unaware of it at the
tine.

<p>
The teleprinter drive routine was my first attempt at
machine code programming although I had purchased a copy of
ZEAP, NASDIS wid DEHUG some time earlier with the intention of
finding out what it was all about having grown tired of using
BASIC. My only machine code experience prior to this was finding
the bugs in a&rsquo;certain games program, Ueeello, published by one
of the national mags. So, armed mith 3 couple of boots and. some
articles on assembly language programming, I set about writing
Program that would allow ae to output listings and text from any
OF the standard software with the relevant output addresses
being changed automatrcal ly.
</p>
<p>
Well, initially, progress was painfully slow with even the
most simple tasks taling sometimes days ta achive, anly to. give
way toa better idea later on. A great deal of knowledge was
Gained from the assembly Listings provided with the Nascom
Software, without which, I am sure you would not be reading this
non. Unfortunately, the program&rsquo;s development stopped frequently
because of problems with the teleprinter, 1&pound; not doing as it was
told. Eventually, after about 6 months, it gave way to an Epson
PXGO as I ws spending all my time heeping the printer working,
ultimately failing. However, by this time the program had
developed to about Ik, half of that being&rdquo; tables and option
menus, but the basre framework was formed.
