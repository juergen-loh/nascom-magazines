4.5 Formatting
</p>
<p>
The FHT command performs correctly except in the case FHT
15,n, where the correct number of figures is displayed, but the
mantissa is rounded to one decimal place less than it should be-fn
example of thie occurs in Chapter 4, where the result of
doing:
</p>
<p>
FHT 45,2: PRINT 547.968
actually gives 5.70E+02, not 5-688+02 as it should.
</p>
<p>
Modify 3168 (was 03) to 04 E6 OF 3C C9 ED E6 OF 3c 21:94
10 85 1

wither the removal&rdquo; of the handshake from device 1 or the
fnelusion ef it in device 2.

3. In Chapter 3 page 19 the assignment LETAR=1+203/4 should of
course assign the value 2.5, not 4.5, ta AA.
</p>
<p>
4. The format of the IOLIST given in Chapter 4 in the first 50
copies of the manual 18 incorrect &ndash; the input and output
devices are transposed. The list should read:
</p>
<p>
IOLIST DEFB 7 + The number of devices used
DEFW GUTO $ Output device 0
DEFW INPO 3 Input device 0
DEFW OUTI + Dutput device 1
:

<p>
DEFW INPL Input device 1
DEFW OUTn-1 3 Gutput device n-1
DEFW INPn-1 i Input device ni
