with an option table asking which piece of Nascom software was
Fequired to be printed, with the option of a second menu to
Select the various output options, 12. 15 a title required, page
number, etc. Later, both option tables were included on the
first Screen. At this stage there was the option of using th
teyboard as a conventional typewriter but this mas removed ai
the Nas-sys &ldquo;H&rdquo; command was almost identical.

<p>
With the arrival of the Epson I suddenly began to see things
ina different light. I knew that this particular printer. was
selling very well in the U.K., therefore, quite a. number of
Nascom owners were likely to purchase &lsquo;one. Consequently, I
thought my little program, along with some changes to. suit&rdquo; the
Epson, might make a good magazine article.
</p>
<p>
There followed a very intensive period of programming to try
and get the bect out of the Epson and so what was initially a.
Felatively simple program soon began to grow into&rdquo; something
rather more involved. Allied to the fact that it was also&rdquo; being
Girected towards other Nascom users, it alsa had to be very
</p>
<p>
to use.
</p>
<p>
Tt wasnt until I reached the part of the program that dealt
with Naspen that my problems began. The Epson printer had the
potential for correspondance quality printing as well as many
</p>
<p>
functions ike changing the print size ete. Obviously, for&rdquo; my
own benefit, 1 wanted to make the most of the. printers:
capatitities: So, T began looking at the larger wordprocessor
Systems ta find out what facilities they offered in the area of
tert farmatting and soon discovered that printer control codes
embedded in the text nas the thing to do. By trapping each
character output from Naspen, embedded control codes can be
intercepted&nbsp;, exeruted and then&rdquo; the codes deleted from the
printed text: There were several decisions to be made at this.
</p>
<p>
point about the form that the embedded code should take and how
to seperate the codes from the test. I eventually settled on
using &gt; bracets ta enclose the code but also. made allowance
</p>
<p>
tor this to be changed 1# required. The parameters to be od
Gn to Nasprint-a0 from the text could be in decimal as the
Program already had a routine to convert decimal to binary which
has used in the page format parameters table, eg page length.
But, there was still the problem of how ta control the printer.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way, from the users point of view, mould be to
have @ series of commands that performed specific functions in
the printer. Unfortunately, the 2k set aside for the program was
filling up fapidly and there was not enough room for a table the
size that would be required for the Epson. Alaa, printer codes
used on the Epson may perform different functions on other
printers. Because of these problems I opted to simply output the
hex. value preceeded by the output command, eq. &lt;o 18 45&gt;. This
command will tell the Epson to. start printing in emphasised
characters. Great, I had basically everything that I needed, but
ahat happens if. in typing ina &lsquo;control cade, you miss&rsquo; the
bracket from the end&nbsp;?..-@&rsquo;&rsquo;8Z&rsquo;&pound;! There was obviously a need
for some fora of error detection.
