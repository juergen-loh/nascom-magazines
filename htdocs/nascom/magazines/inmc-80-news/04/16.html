Dear INMC80,
</p>
<h4 id="article1" class="uppercase">
Black Flashes
</h4>
<p>
I agree with S.C. Willmott that the black flashes are irritating. To get rid
of them should be an easy matter of connecting the BUSREQ line to the video blanking,
so that the Z80 does not access the video memory during the display time. This would
cause the Z80 to work a little slower than it does at the moment, but it is only like
having a 2MHz clock. Note, it could still suffer from the dreaded black flasher&nbsp;, but
only if the Z80 was making an access to the screen at that moment. The loss of speed
can be calculated as:
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>loss%</td><td>= (1&ndash;(16*14*48)/(320*64)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= 1&ndash;(time displaying)/(total frame time)</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>= approx 50%</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="continued">
This would be equivalent to a clock rate of 2MHz. The lines must be tied FALSE so that
they don&rsquo;t do funny things while the bus is idle. I have not tried this but it should
work.

<span class="uppercase">Basic Toolkit</span> (Parkinson)
</h4>
<p>
With regard to Mr Parkinson&rsquo;s documentation, I think that he has got it about
right, except that as his toolkit tends to be disabled by any sort of reset, and has
to be reloaded, (this is a serious drawback), a mention of how to effect a warm start
would be a help. (You ain&rsquo;t read the instructions, execute an address three bytes less
than the top address used by &lsquo;Toolkit&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;ll warm start. Ed.) On the toolkit, a
few unwelcome suggestions are as follows. The find command could be made to translate
the codes by using the BASIC itself. If the string was entered as a line, say line 0,
then let the Find do its comparison. After the command, the line could be deleted.
Long lines could be handled by looking for a &ldquo;\&rdquo; as the first character, and then
including the previous line as the start of the basic line, using a modified INLIN. It
is possible to keep making suggestions, but then it gets a bit out of hand. The
renumber and cross reference are worth it alone, with the others as a bonus. The find
needs to use reserved words, and a warm start should be enough to make an issue&nbsp;2.

<span class="uppercase">New Ram64 Board</span> and <span class="uppercase">The Son Of Page Mode</span>
</h4>
<p>
I have installed a RAM64 board onto my N2, which means that I now have 96k on
line. The page mode is installed on both
<?php externalLink("RAM&nbsp;B"); ?>
and the RAM64. The RAM64 worked first
time and without problems, but the RAM&nbsp;B started giving problems for the first time in
a year. I have not tracked down the problem yet, but sometimes it works and some times
it doesn&rsquo;t. One of those! Since I only have a 3A psu, it may be loss of power, but I
will try putting heavy wires from the psu to the bus.
</p>
<p>
An interesting problem arises when I try to use BASIC. The BASIC initialises
Ok but as soon as I hit a key, it crashes. Particularly when I have the Toolkit
loaded. It could be something to do with the IO select line used by the page mode
hardware. It is surprising that Nascom used 128 ports! (What?&nbsp;&ndash; Ed.)
</p>
<p>
A weakness of the N2 memory map means that the workspace of a lot of the
firmware is not, and cannot be put onto a page. This is a serious draw back to the
system as designed. Another drawback is the inability to use <?php externalLink("Z80 DMA","DMA"); ?> to the closed page.
When (if) I design my DMA disk interface to run with my (also yet to be designed)
super disk system, I won&rsquo;t be able to swap closed pages to provide a disk cache
memory. I can&rsquo;t think what I would use it for..............
</p>
<p>
That aside, the page mode is a bit limited in its use because the system turns
off whole boards at a time. That means it is necessary to copy the contents across
from one page to the other of portions that are common. Also, addresses occupied by
firmware can&rsquo;t be got at, such as the bottom 4k, the top 8k. A slight modification to
the board would allow a substantial increase in flexibility. If each card had its own
port number, and the 8 bit latch was used to enable either blocks of memory (in 16K
