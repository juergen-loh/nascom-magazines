4.00, whilst re-susbcription will cost you 6.00 (even though for 6.00, you will be
sure of getting one as this also covers the postage and subscription administration).
Well we&rsquo;re going to stop that one, from now on the retail price in your local dealers
is going to be 1.50 (and we&rsquo;re going to charge the dealers more for it), so that means
a greater incentive to you to resubsribe, and that INMC80 can probably continue for
some time without increasing the subscription rate.

With the imminent demise of Nascom in sight, we felt that to keep this
newsletter going, it would be neccessary to &lsquo;latch on to&rsquo; some other product that
would provide the membership which in turn would provide the income to allow us to
continue. You see, although this newsletter is NOT a commercial vehicle for the
benefit of any manufacturer, without the support of manufacturers in producing
products which they sell, and you buy and then want to know more about, we can not
exist. To this end, in the last but one issue it was mooted that as there are more
Nasbus compatible products around than those that originate from Nascom, we ought to
become less Nascom orientated and more Nasbus orientated. We asked you for your views,
and out of a membership of about 2,000, and judging by the numbers of newsletters sold
in all, a readership well in excess of 4,000, we received no less that 4 replies.
Staggering isn&rsquo;t it, 0.1% replied!!!! Does that mean that the other 3996 readers don&rsquo;t
care what we do, or is the lack of positive action to be taken as disapproval, or that
the whole question is so obvious that it doesn&rsquo;t require comment, or what? I might add
that those four letters were all in favour. (Dr. Dark seems to be in favour as well,
from his comments in the last Dr. Dark&rsquo;s Diary.)
</p>
<p>
All this leads up to the quandary we are now in. Nascom have had a last minute
reprieve and, at the same time, what amounts to a new computer based on a similar bus
structure is soon to be launched. The software for the new computer will be derived
from much of the existing Nascom software. No it&rsquo;s not a rip-off, most of Nascom&rsquo;s
software is either &lsquo;public domain&rsquo; or privately owned by individuals not in any way
connected with Nascom. These guys saw their products about to die with Nascom and have
done the sensible thing of adapting their software to the new machine, in many cases
with considerable enhancements.
</p>
<p>
On Nascoms&rsquo; death we intended to switch our allegience to the bus, and so by
implication to the new computer, which with it&rsquo;s close adherence to existing Nascom
design conventions would allow us to continue, to the benefit of our Nascom
readership, and of course, to owners of the new machine.
</p>
<p>
Now, what are we to do. Support Nascom and Nascom products only? Or support
the bus, and by so doing, support Nascom and anything else that comes along?
</p>
<p>
It is our belief that to support the bus would be the best course. That way we
will be able to keep our readership informed of developments on all fronts. But it is
up to you to let us know. We wish to be guided by our members. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
drop us a line. Make it simple, Nascom only or the bus? We expect to receive hundreds
of letters (not just four). If, you feel this matter should be debated, then write to
the letters column. We don&rsquo;t intend taking any decisions until the <a href="../text/"></a>issue after next,
so if we&rsquo;ve stirred up a hornets nest (I personally hope so) we&rsquo;ll publish the letters
in the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue and let the membership decide.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, in this issue and the next, we will try to keep our usual
balance, but so that you know what is coming, we include details of the new machine.
</p>
<p>
So, to finish up, life is almost back to normal Nascomwise. We look forward to
the new developments on the Nascom front (and if they remember to tell us first, we&rsquo;ll
pass any news on to the most important Nascom owners, YOU, as fast as we can). In the
meantime we want to open the bus debate. So please write, I can promise you your
comments will be considered fully, although I doubt if we&rsquo;ll have time to reply to
individuals. Don&rsquo;t forget, we need material for this rag, so keep it coming. Until the
next time...
