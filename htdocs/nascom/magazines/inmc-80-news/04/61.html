the piranha, and panics half the time. The Nurse always
panics, but half the time she is calmed down, and half the
time she jumps (alone) out of the boat and must swim ashore.
When the boat capsizes, everybody must swim. Dead people always
float to the correct shore, and incredibly, the canoe gets
there too.

<p>
When swimming the events that follow may occur to each person in the water,
individually:
</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-right: 9em">
Dead people always float ashore<br>
Live people make it ashore unscathed half the time. The other
half, they aquire minor wounds (probabilty 0.67) or major
wounds (probabilty 0.33). In no case do they come out of the
river healthier than they went in. (Note, these probabilities
could be made worse the further there is to swim.)
</p>
<p class="indent" style="margin-right: 9em">
On shore the victims health may become worse with the following probability:
Healthy people never get worse.<br>
Attended people get worse with a probability of 0.11.<br>
Unattended people get worse with a probability of 0.33.<br>
Dead people never get worse.<br>
To get worse means that a minor wound becomes a major wound or
a person with a major wound dies.<br>
When a minor attended wound gets worse, it become a major
unattended wound.<br>
The &lsquo;Worse Health&rsquo; events should be computed for each person
once per canoe trip, whether or not the person participated in
the latest trip. So people who were wounded early in the game
have more chance of getting worse that people wounded later.

Certain programmers with particularly warped minds might like to modify the
program for a &lsquo;Maximum carnage game&rsquo; (minimum score). To do this you need a new rule:
On each successive trip you must leave at least one more person on the shore than the
previous round trip.
