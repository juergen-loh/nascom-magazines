It was recently announced that Nascom has been bought by Lucas Logic (pity
no-one remembered to invite me to the celebration), and this started my mind thinking
about all the benefits that such a giant could offer Nascom. For instance, have you
ever had trouble connecting things to all those tiny little pins scattered all over
the N2 board? Perhaps we&rsquo;ll now see these changed for nice sensible quarter inch Lucar
connectors!

From the advance copy I&rsquo;ve seen of this issue of the newsletter, it seems that
Gemini gets more than it&rsquo;s fair share of space. Well, we all know from our basic
astrology that Gemini is (are?) the &lsquo;twins&rsquo;. But do you know the twin&rsquo;s names? Yes of
course, it&rsquo;s Castor and Pollox. So, from now on you know that Gemini is Castor and
Pollox. Please make sure you&rsquo;ve got the right teeth in if you&rsquo;re going to say that
quickly. (Reminds me of all the permutations of the Accles and Pollock ads we used to
have on the London tube.) Any (printable) suggestions please?

On the subject of Gemini, did you know that a soon to be announced Hewlett
Packard computer (using twin 16 bit processors) has been dubbed with the &lsquo;in-house&rsquo;
name of &lsquo;The Gemini Computer&rsquo;. Reports suggest that Gemini aren&rsquo;t pleased, and will be
even less pleased if the advertising copywriters latch onto the name. Me? I didn&rsquo;t say
a word, did I?

We hear reports of Nascom power supplies starting to get embarrassed by the
ever increasing loads being imposed by the endless goodies users will insist on
fitting to their toys. There are red faces in the Henry&rsquo;s camp, because the genius who
designed their interpretation of the theme included a spurious 0.68R resistor in the
unregulated 5V rail (to limit regulator dissipation when lightly loaded, they say),
which means that their PSU exhibits spectacular hum bars on the display when pushed.
Answer, take it out. Anyway, to overcome the shortage of juice, there&rsquo;s always
Nascom&rsquo;s 8 amp PSU, assuming you can afford a second mortgage ..... or Aztec do a very
small neat switch mode 6 amp PSU at the 100 off price of 52.00. Now that price is
interesting when you consider Tangerine (you know, those bright orange things) are
offering a switch mode 6 amp PSU with Aztec written all over it, for the one off
retail price of 49.00. Makes you wonder what sort of deal they came too.

Overheard in a shop recently, the remark made by a cash paying customer buying
a disk system. In reply to his wife&rsquo;s comment that 700 quid was a lot to shell out for
such a small box, he said, &ldquo;I know dear, but it&rsquo;ll make a lovely bookend!&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
And in conclusion, the postscript to a letter from a member suggests that if
your Nascom is poorly, then you should try Lucas-aid!!
