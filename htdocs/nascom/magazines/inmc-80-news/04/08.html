Anyway enough of that, I have a couple of problems which despite much book and
magazine searching haven&rsquo;t been resolved.
</p>
<p>
The first is the INP function, would it be possible to write a section on how
this works and when we use it. I&rsquo;ve found it in a Computing Today program and cannot
fathom out how it works at all.
</p>
<p>
The second problem is that of a timer to indicate how long a program has run.
</p>
<p>
To give an example &ndash; lets say that we wished to time how long a pupil took to
do &lsquo;say 10 sums&rsquo;. How could we do this? The PET has a time function but such a
function is not available on our Basic. Is there a machine code sub-routine to do this
&ndash; such a routine would be extremely useful to me.
</p>
<p>
Once again thanks for a great machine &ndash; hope it keeps going for many years.

<u>Funny Tapes?</u>
</h3>
<p>
As Nascom Dealers we frequently encounter customers with a low opinion of
cassette tape as a storage medium despite us knowing that the hardware is totally
satisfactory. Such customers invariable ignore what we now believe to be the true
cause &ndash; sub-standard cassette tapes! In common with other Dealers we sell blank C10 or
Cl2 cassette tapes believing them to be &ldquo;screened against drop-outs&rdquo; and therefore
suitable for the recording of digital data. After trying the wares of many suppliers
of &ldquo;screened&rdquo; tapes (this includes a number of well-known &ldquo;branded&rdquo; products) we have
now come to the conclusion that if, indeed, they are tested for drop-outs, then the
test criteria are totally inadequate. We name no names because it seems that all
suppliers offer the same (abysmally low) standard.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Among problems that we have so far encountered are:&ndash;<br>
Errors because the tape gets creased by most normal cassette recorders.<br>
Errors because over-recording does not erase the old data.<br>
Errors because a tape is read fairly frequently and wears out very quickly.<br>
No (yes NO!) oxide layer on the tape. (It took a long time trying to decide if
this was a &ldquo;Read&rdquo; error or a &ldquo;Write&rdquo; error!)<br>
</p>
<p>
When asked, suppliers invariably say that since no other customers have
problems, &ldquo;it must be you&rdquo; (does this mean all other customers are using low baud
rates such as that used by TRS80 etc. and can therefore be supplied with low quality
tapes without repercussion?)
</p>
<p>
In view of this widespread problem, have any of your readers found a source of
supply that is always reliable?
