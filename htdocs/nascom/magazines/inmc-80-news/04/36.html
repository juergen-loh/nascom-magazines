The Command Level.
</h3>
<p>
First, have a look at flow chart number 1, which symbolises the &ldquo;highest&rdquo;
level of our interpreter. The box labelled INIT refers to the necessary initialisation
that must be done, as most of you will have realised. Rather than describe the whole
of the command level, I shall procede to code it, before your very eyes! (By the way,
has anyone found a way of passing Zeap files to Naspen?)
