</h3>
<p>
There is a BOOB in
<a href="../../../03/52/text/#article1">INMC80/3</a>.
In the drawing of the Reset Jump circuit, pins 1
and 15 of the 74LS257 should be interchanged. The circuit works very nicely, and I
have it running. I also changed my clock link to 4MHz, with great success.

<u>Documentation</u>
</h3>
<p>
I am writing to reply to David Pasrkinsons letter in
<a href="../../../03/10/text/#article1">Issue&nbsp;3</a>.
</p>
<p>
Dear David, Your letter on documentation was very stimulating and prompts me
to answer. Rather than take up your numbered questions I will get straight to the
point.
</p>
<p>
I would like to see source listings included and would be more than happy to
pay the increased costs. This is for two reasons:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis">
<li>
Having the source code enables me to easily tailor the program to my needs.
</li>
<li>
I have learnt much by studying program listings &ndash; particularly yours! (Revas is
an excellent program.) I have just purchased a 1K program from a fellow in Glasgow
that interfaces to a Selectric printer. It came with a commented source listing and
the cassette tape also contained a Zeap file of the source code! This is perfect. I
couldn&rsquo;t ask for more. I wish other authors would follow suit.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So &ndash; please make your toolkit source available as it would make the product
twice as valuable as far as I am concerned.
</p>

<u><span class="uppercase">Unkilling</span></u>
</h3>
<p>
Just a note in case anyone has missed it. The magic method in Appendix III of
the NASPEN Firmware Manual will not only recover a text from cold start but also from
&lsquo;KILL&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
If you have killed your text by accident, what you do is as follows:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Leave NASPEN by typing &lsquo;N&rsquo;.<br>
Type &lsquo;M101A&rsquo; new line (backspace over the &lsquo;n&rsquo; if it is there)<br>
Type &lsquo;12 10 2.&rsquo; new line<br>
Type &lsquo;E B806&rsquo; new line (NASPEN warm start)<br>
Press space bar twice.<br>
Step to end of text using only new line and the space bar; don&rsquo;t go further
than the last character in your text.<br>
Type &lsquo;K&rsquo; then &lsquo;Y&rsquo;.<br>
Type &lsquo;Z&rsquo; and remove strange character at beginning of text (use &lsquo;I&rsquo; and back
space). Incidentally if you get the cursor stuck to the left of it just press cursor
arrow down.<br>
Replace missing characters at beginning of text and reset line length and page
length (1 &amp; 2, 3 &amp; 4).
</p>
<p>
Hope this saves someone some typing.

<u>Printers and Naspen</u>
</h3>
<p>
Although I have had my Nascom&nbsp;2 for a year or so now, I have only just made a
subscription to the news letter as I wished to wait for it to establish itself and to
contain a little more information and articles on the 2 rather than the 1.
