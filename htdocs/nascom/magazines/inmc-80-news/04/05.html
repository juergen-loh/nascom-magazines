<h3>
Nascom Rules&nbsp;!
</h3>
<p>
Congratulations on the latest issues of the Club Newsletter. They were as
usual very interesting. I was particularly interested in the &lsquo;System Software&rsquo; items
such as &lsquo;Load and Tab&rsquo;, &lsquo;VARPRO&rsquo;, &lsquo;CC.COM&rsquo; and &lsquo;GLOBAL.CRT&rsquo;, as it is from this type
of item that one can get a much better understanding of the insides of NAS-SYS, BASIC,
CP/M etc.
</p>
<p>
I am very glad, having recently had short encounters with a PET, a TANDY, and
also with an Apple, to say nothing of a 6800 and an 8085 development system, that TI
chose (quite by chance at the time), Nascom and the Z80.
</p>
<p>
Since the Nascom&nbsp;1, in early 1979, was just about the only available choice
for a cheap single board system, the choice was largely decided for me.
</p>
<p>
I have now graduated to a Nascom&nbsp;2 with full DOS/CP/M available and it only
remains for me to add a colour board and an 80x25 screen format to make the system
complete.
</p>
<p>
I do have one &lsquo;moan&rsquo;. It relates to publicity for NASCOM and INMC80.
</p>
<p>
Many of the short &lsquo;What&rsquo;s Available&rsquo; and &lsquo;Buyers Guide&rdquo; items in the Computing
Magazines are hopelessly inaccurate when it comes to Nascom products and compatible
accessories from other sources. It almost seems to me as if P.C. have a bias against
NASCOM, and PCW are little better.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the listings of Local and National Clubs have often omitted INMC80,
although I see that the club is listed in this months&rsquo; P.C.
</p>
<p>
Please keep up the good work. I only wish I lived nearer so that I could give
more than verbal assistance.
</p>

Best wishes for continued success.

Just a few points.
</h3>
<p>
Many thanks for the effort put into INMC80 which continues to be a mine of
useful hints and tips and also provides a &lsquo;clearing house&rdquo; for the discussion of
certain well-known (to some) bugs in NASCOM hardware.
</p>
<p>
For the amusement of all readers of INMC80 please mention the following
misprint on P.123 of William Barden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Z80 Microcomputer Handbook&rdquo;. Line 5 refers to
&ldquo;... the eternal interrupt...&rdquo;!! (Is this what sends the CPU to that great mainframe
in the sky!).
</p>
<p>
Regarding David Parkinson&rsquo;s request for comments on documentation, may I
suggest a compromise in the amount of detail provided with a program? As was stated a
complete source code listing is liable to be expensive but how about:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
(a) Indicating major sections and/or subroutines by memory address;
</p>
<p>
(b) indicating also by memory address the positions of Code, Tables, Workspace
and Message Text so that disassembly may be carried out without too much Sherlock
Holmes work;
</p>
<p>
(c) noting if any Monitor pointers or reflections have been modified.
</p>

Radio Hams
</h3>
<p>
I think the INMC80 News is an extraordinary effort reflecting much enthusiasm
and one hell of a lot of very hard work and I appreciate it enough to join the chorus
for more issues, more often. No, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ve nothing to contribute (yet) but I
would ask if you could put in a few lines stating that being a Radio Amateur (GM3TYS)
and have an ICOM IC245E VHF Transceiver, I would like to contact any enthusiast who
may have succeeded in interfacing an IC&nbsp;245E/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>IC211 with his Nascom&nbsp;2. My intention is
to do this and eventually write a program allowing frequency control, scan, search,
logging and RTTY/C.W. communication.
