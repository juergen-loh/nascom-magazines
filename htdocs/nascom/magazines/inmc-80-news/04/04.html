Dear INMC80,
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve no doubt that you have heard before receiving this newsletter the news about the
takeover of Nascom Microcomputers by Lucas Logic Ltd. Many magazines and newspapers
carried the story and it was heartening to see how many thought it was worth front
page treatment. Obviously we did not buy Nascom just to get into the newspapers but we
were struck by the almost universal good wishes bestowed on us for keeping Nascom
alive.
</p>
<p>
Before making our bid for Nascom we evaluated the products thoroughly (helped of
course by Nascom users on the staff) and it was obviously too good a computer to let
go. This view was supported by the fact that there is such an active users club and so
many dealers still supplying parts and service.
</p>
<p>
So we know we have a good computer, a loyal distributor network and thousands of
satisfied customers. Where to now? Well apart from knowing that Nascom had a lot to
offer us we felt that we could offer Nascom a vigorous future, not just in its
traditional markets but in industry and business. Please don&rsquo;t feel that we are going
to concentrate solely on industrial users and ignore the enthusiasts. Here in Warwick
we have the capability to do a lot with Nascom, in all directions and without falling
flat on our faces because we have stretched ourselves too far.
</p>
<p>
What is in store then? We don&rsquo;t want to release too much information just yet but
there are a number of products which we hope you will see quite soon. First a twin
floppy disk system which Nascom had started to work on but receivership had prevented
from progressing. There will also be some new boards such as a colour board. We intend
that it should be possible to buy a Nascom board ready assembled and also a Nascom
assembled in a cabinet. There are some very good enclosures around, the Kenilworth
case being particularly suitable; there will still be a need for specific enclosures
for particular needs. However to improve the general appeal of the Nascom computer a
fully enclosed version is needed. Perhaps the most important development to keep us up
in the running will be to ensure that the Nascom computer is compatible with the BBC
microcomputing series in January 1982. Launch dates for all these products are still
being worked out but we fully intend to have them all available this year.
</p>
<p>
As you can see we are working hard with Nascom and we intend to remain among the
leaders in microcomputing. Obviously we will support INMC80 with information, but what
is all this about rival computers in the INMC80 News? We fully support the principle
of compatible products and we are about to launch a Nascom approved scheme for the
best. But if INMC80 News wishes to back rival products as well then it should rename
itself &ldquo;Practical Computing&rdquo; or similar appropriate name. Give us a chance Mr Chairman
and if then we foul it up you can include every widgit that you fancy.
</p>
<p>
Having got that off my chest I must say that I am pleased to write my first letter to
the INMC80 News and I hope that it will not be the last one. We will welcome your
letters too; Ken Jones our Sales Manager would like to hear from you.
