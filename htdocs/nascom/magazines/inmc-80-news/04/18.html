The <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","HISOFT"); ?> NASPAS compiler comes on tape in two versions. One runs under
HISOFT&rsquo;s own NASMON, the other, with which we are here concerned, runs under Nas-Sys.
On the review machine, it is running under Nas-Sys&nbsp;3, but I see no obstacle to it
running under Nas-Sys&nbsp;1. As supplied, you receive a tape, recorded in CUTS at 300
baud, and a documentation package consisting of a manual of 9 A4 pages to the NASLIN
editor supplied as part of the package, a manual of 63 pages to the NASPAS itself, and
a three page implementation note describing how to get the package running under
Nas-Sys.

<p>
The tape loaded first go, with no tape errors. As the program is so long, the
tape is recorded on both sides. After loading the first side, which is set up using
the &lsquo;G&rsquo; command, the tape is turned over and the second side loaded. When loading is
finished, the Nascom prompts with a message to
</p>
<p>
E**** XXXX YYYY
</p>
<p>
where the **** address is supplied (43B1H in my copy) on the screen, XXXX marks the
start of the compiler proper, and YYYY marks the start of the runtime support
routines. The compiler is 27AAH bytes long (just under 10K) and the runtimes are 0B88H
bytes long (just under 3K). The implementation note supplied indicates that the
compiler should not be located below 1C00H in memory, presumably as it will overwrite
itself in the relocation. Normally, the compiler and runtime routines would live at
the top of memory, and suggested addresses are supplied in the implementation note. In
a 32k system, the compiler lives at 5CCEH, and the runtimes at 8478H. In a 48k system,
the addresses are 9CCEH and C478H. The note doesn&rsquo;t give the addresses for a full
system, but they are easily calculated to be CCCEH and F478H.
</p>
<p>
When the relocation has taken place, the Nas-Sys message is displayed, and an
execute address for the compiler. In the case of the three memory sizes I have been
discussing, these addresses are 5F9EH, 9F9EH, and CF9EH. This address should be
carefully noted, as it is the entry point for the compiler at all stages. The
relocated compiler can now be recorded on tape, including the runtime support
routines. According to the implementation note supplied, the original compiler &ndash; that
before relocation &ndash; can not be dumped to tape.
</p>
<p>
All set? Then we can enter the compiler. WAIT! The implementation note
requires four parameters to be specified along with the execute address &ndash; the
positions of where the code generated by the compiler is to be placed, the location of
the runtime stack, used for variable storage etc., the address from which you would
like the compiled code to execute, as opposed to where it resides during compilation
(this facility allows the code to be placed on top of the source or even of the
compiler itself. NOTE: NOT the runtimes!) and finally the position of the start of the
current text file. However, this complication of specifying four parameters is
simplified for us by the compiler writer. If these parameters are entered as 0 &ndash; NOT
left blank!&ndash; then the compiler automatically allocates default values. For general
messing about, this is quite satisfactory, and allows you the option of specifying
your various workspace areas etc. as you need. Do not forget to enter the four zeros
seperated by spaces after the execute address. Otherwise very unpleasant things may
happen!
</p>
<p>
The NASLIN editor supplied is very similar to a BASIC line editor, or to the
ZEAP editor. Each Line has a number, and the editor puts them in their correct place
relative to each other.
