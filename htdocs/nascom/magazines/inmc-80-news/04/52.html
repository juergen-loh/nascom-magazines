Two more fields have appeared, the &lsquo;address&rsquo; field and the &lsquo;object&rsquo; field. The
address field contains the address of the first byte of the instruction. The object
field contains the byte or bytes which make up the particular instruction starting at
the the address given, and for subsequent addresses to the start of the next
instruction

Now to the assembled program itself, I&rsquo;ve changed some of the label names. The
main program loop has been called LOOP1, START would have been inappropriate, as the
loop no longer goes back to the beginning of the program. Having called the main loop
LOOP1, then it makes sense to change the label for the delay loop to LOOP2.
</p>
<p>
A &lsquo;quirk&rsquo; of this particular assembler is that it requires a colon at the end
of the label (to tell it where the label ends), except when the label is followed by
an assembler directive (EQU or ORG). Some assemblers follow this convention, some
don&rsquo;t!! This assembler allows an assembler directive called &lsquo;.Comment&rsquo;, and this
allows me to write a chunk of descriptive text about the program without having to put
a semicolon at the start of each comment line. Notice that semicolons are still used
to separate the mnemonics from comments though, it&rsquo;s only provided for convenience.
This assembler likes another assembler directive, an &lsquo;END&rsquo; at the end of the program,
some assemblers will chuck this out as an error.
</p>
<p>
See that I defined the characters I want to place on the screen as actual
characters enclosed in quotes. Most assemblers will allow this, and it a nice practice
to do this when you actually mean &lsquo;Load A with a character&rsquo;, as opposed to &lsquo;Load A
with a variable&rsquo;. (To the casual glance, LD A,2AH could mean either). Assemblers will
usually allow decimal numbers to be entered, and they will automatically convert them
to HEX for you. Look where I load the B register in the DELAY subroutine. I put LD
B,200, and the assembler took it as a decimal number because I left off the &lsquo;H&rsquo;
suffix. Another thing this particular assembler does (and many others don&rsquo;t) is to
print any two byte operands the &lsquo;right way round&rsquo;, this makes for easy reading of the
assembled object code because it prints it the way you &lsquo;think&rsquo;, but remember, two byte
operands are always entered low byte first, so the listed code this particular
assembler prints is not exactly as it would appear when placed (or automatically
assembled) in memory.
</p>
<p>
So that&rsquo;s an assembler. The little counter at the top of the screen is down to
600 odd, so this is where it&rsquo;s got to finish. It&rsquo;s quite likely that there will be
plenty of assembly listings in this issue. See if you can read them, by looking at the
labels. You don&rsquo;t have to think too hard about what the code is doing (will that be
the next part of this never ending saga, I wonder), but given that the programmer has
thought carefully about the structure of the program and chosen his labels wisely, it
should make some sort of sense. The moral of this part of the story has been, think of
your specifications, and think carefully about your choice of labels. You never know,
you might not be the only one who will read your programs one day, so why make life
difficult for the other fella?
