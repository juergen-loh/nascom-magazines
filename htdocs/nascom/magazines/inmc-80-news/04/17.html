blocks of seperate read and write, or 8K blocks of R/W memory, working on the memory
decode signals), or to enable banks of memory. In this way, a single card could have
all 4 banks addressed to the same 16k, and the software would only enable one at a
time. This would allow programs to use this area as fast disk space. Or as &ldquo;protected&rdquo;
space for saving back-up copies of programs you have just written but not tested (you
know &hellip; the ones that write all over memory for you in less time than it takes to hit
reset).

System Growth Outstrips Psu
</h4>
<p>
My intention is to go over to a complete RAM system with a disk and an
operating system. CP/M would be nice but I think the investment too high at the
moment. I would have to throw away all my current software, unless someone wants to
make an offer for my firmware. (Cost was about 200.00+VAT).

My latest addition has been a 12inch monitor which replaces a borrowed B/W TV
I used to think was quite good until I got this. I am now thinking of shoe-horning my
N2 into the box, as there is just room if ..... the whole problem is the noisy fan
that I must have to keep the smell of burning off the 3A psu which is giving its all.
If I build a new 5A psu on the back panel then maybe the rest will fit inside and I
can throw away the noisy fan.

<p>
One mod I would like to see is an 80 by 24 line screen so that I can see what
I am getting with NAS-PEN. (Just read this issue, but the snag is a new NAS-PEN. Ed.)
</p>
<p>
Rename the bus, NASty-BUSiness. You could have it on your adds &ndash; writ large,
so to speak.
</p>
<p>
Keep up the good work, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without INMC80 coming out with
so many goodies.
