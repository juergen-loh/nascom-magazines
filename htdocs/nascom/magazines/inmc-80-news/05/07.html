<u>RESTORING BASIC</u>
</h3>
<p>
Have you ever typed CLOAD when you really meant CSAVE? Come on now
admit it. Well all is not lost. The only thing that has happened is that two
pointers have been changed and they are easy to change back. This program
restores the pointers and warm starts basic for you.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to use it is to have a generated tape. All that is
needed then is to reset and play the tape. The program can go anywhere in
memory, so long as it does not overwrite the basic, and it will also recover
from NEW and a basic cold start

<u>SPACE INVADERS</u>
</h3>
<p>
I have just received INMC80 News and would like to congratulate you on
its quality.
</p>
<p>
With reference to W.Squires letter in the <a href="../text/#article1"></a>INMC80-3 edition I have
enclosed a relocatable routine which will allow you to select the keys used to
control the base movement. Once the routine has been typed in the
<a href="../../../02/57/text/#article1">Space Invaders</a>
program should be executed from the start of the routine.

(NAS-SYS only)

<p>
To slow down the speed of the game he could insert the following simple delay
routine at 1776H, to change the delay length he should alter the value at
1777.
</p>
<pre>
1776 06 30 FF 10 FD 00 00 .......
1780 00 00.
</pre>
<p>
This replaces the routine which checks which monitor is being used, I
have assumed that he is using NAS-SYS. These may not be the best solutions to
the problems, but they do work.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I have the Xtal 2.2 BASIC and would like to add the SET,
RESET, and TEST commands to it, could you please publish an article on how
this could be done. (Any volunteers &ndash; Ed.) Also is it possible to add extra
commands to NASPEN? I have in mind commands such as &lsquo;find a word and replace
it with another&rsquo; or &lsquo;delete word&rsquo;.
