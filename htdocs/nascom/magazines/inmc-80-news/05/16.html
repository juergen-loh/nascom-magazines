Dear Editor INMC80,
</p>
<p>
THE BUS OF COURSE. Mr. J. N. S. Deane of Lucas Logic appeals for a
chance. By all means Lucas should be given a fair chance but he should not be
surprised that Nascom owners are more than a little uneasy about resting their
eggs in one basket.
</p>
<p>
Most are capable of appreciating a good product, why else did we plump
for a Nascom. The market is here with we the owners or future owners, and the
customer is king. He can be sure we will continue to exercise care in
selecting products. I wish him well, as like most I would like to see Nascom
flourish. If however he is overwelmed by smaller competition he can rest
assured it is because he has not appreciated our needs, or that our money can
buy better elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks to you all in producing an excellent news letter, more
power to your Naspen.

Dear INMC80,

<p>
Yes, follow the bus unless it&rsquo;s essential to &lsquo;keep in&rsquo; with Lucas Logic.

Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
With regard to the direction the club should take in future, there has
in the past been no question of restricting it purely to Nascom items and
excluding other companies&rsquo; products. The real question then, it do we choose
to ignore one particular item from Gemini&rsquo;s compatible product range whilst
acknowledging the rest?
</p>
<p>
If we do so, where do we draw the line? Perhaps by accepting only
products that Nascom think fit to approve. The club would then regress to
little more than a mouthpiece for Nascom. Pretending that the Gemini board
does not exist would also inevitably lead to coy references to &lsquo;the other
system&rsquo;, and confusion and duplication of effort by owners of the different
systems.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, much mutual benefit and experience could be gained
from users of another intrinsically very similar machine. After all, Gemini
users will be trying to do broadly the same things with the same add-ons, and
(with disks at least. Ed.) with very similar software as Nascom users.
</p>
<p>
In my view therefore, we have to go for the &lsquo;Nasbus compatible&rsquo;
approach, and brush aside calls to ignore anything non-Nascom.

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I feel most strongly on this matter and would certainly discontinue my
membership if the Nascom content were diluted. Most people are apathetic until
&lsquo;it&rsquo; affects them and I suspect protests would not occur until after any
decision had been taken. Please give Lucas a chance, they obviously realise
that Nascom&nbsp;3 is needed and perhaps a reworked Nascom&nbsp;2.
</p>
<p>
Nascom&rsquo;s success to date has been that you can personalize the
computer, understand, alter and modify as the mood/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>requirement dictates. One
can see how all this has contributed to the success of Nascom by the numbers
of add-ons that have been produced. Not everybody needs an all dancing all
singing micro.
