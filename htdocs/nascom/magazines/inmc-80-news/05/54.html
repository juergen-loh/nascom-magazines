I have just finished a new version of SYS for the new double density disk
card from Gemini, but this is not so important because the MOVCPM software
provided with it is very good anyway. I have also created a special version
for this disk card which has a &ldquo;pseudo disk&rdquo; which is really two 64K RAM cards
on other pages, pretending to be a very high performance disk! I also look
forward to seeing the new Nascom disk card, also double density, which is
rumoured to be well under way.

Before criticising CP/M it is important to remember that much of its
appearance to the user depends on how it has been implemented on a particular
machine. I have seen several machines with errors or inadequacies in the CP/M
implementation. Both users and suppliers then unfairly blame Digital Research
for what is in fact a poorly written BIOS. To put both sides of the argument,
CP/M is crude and unfriendly, but it is also a simple and effective means of
providing a standardised software interface for a vast variety of good
software, provided it is installed correctly.

With the recent development of the Gemini G809 double density disk
controller card, a defficiency in the original Henelec Format program has come
to light. Two things about the Gemini G809 card have forced a change. Firstly,
the G809 uses the more recent Western Digital WD1797 controller chip set, and
secondly the G809 BIOS automatically selects between double/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>single density on
any drive other than drive A. The single density format is identical to the
Henelec/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini G805. This should mean that you can zap disks from the G805 into
drive B of the G809 and PIP stuff in either direction with impunity.
Unfortunately, the WD1797 senses which side of the disk is in use by picking up
a &lsquo;sides&rsquo; identifier byte slotted in the gap between the original track and
sector identifiers of the G805 format. Now a disk formatted with the original
Henelec software will not supply the &lsquo;sides&rsquo; flag, so the G809 will think that
the disk has only one side, with possibly disastrous results. To get round this
problem a new format program has been written. This provides compatibilty with
the G809, as well as providing a worthwhile 37 to 45% improvement in operating
speed for G805 systems running at 4MHz without WAITs. This new format routine
is available from Henry&rsquo;s and Interface at a nominal handling charge of 50p to
customers who wander in clutching a disk in their mits. Or 75p (plus the cost
of a disk if you don&rsquo;t send one) through the post.
