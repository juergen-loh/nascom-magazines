Printer support is extensive, allowing either a serial, serial with
handshake, or parallel printer to be driven. The parallel driver allows for an
8 bit interface and connecting my Epson was a doddle. You can also set a form
feed control, the number of lines per printed page, and the gap between pages
by modifying a &lsquo;Patch area&rdquo; in the BIOS. This is easily done, and other
conditions that can be altered are the default I/O byte, the cursor blink rate
(or cursor type if the IVC is in use), the repeat rates of the keyboard (both
initial and running rates), the ports used for I/O (useful if an I/O board is
being used), and &ndash; wait for it &ndash; the keyboard code used to select EDIT mode!!
</p>
<p>
Now Nas-Sys owners are probably unimpressed with the last sentence,
but for CP/M users an Edit facility is a joy very rarely found elsewhere (if
at all?). The ability to enter Edit by typing &lsquo;GRAPH 1&rsquo; (unless you have
changed the code in the Patch area) and hop around the screen is great. (My
enthusiasm is because I didn&rsquo;t read the manual fully for a while, and did not
realise that this facility was included!) Whilst in Edit the cursor changes
shape, reverting to normal when &lsquo;Enter&rsquo; is pressed and Edit mode left.

<u>CONCLUSIONS</u>
</h3>
<p>
I bought the Gemini disk system with a certain amount of reservation.
After all, Lucas are supposed to be introducing their own card soon, and I
wondered whether I should wait yet longer for this. However, I am told that
this still uses the design started well before Nascom went into Receivership,
and a nearly 3 year old design is very old in this business. Plus the Gemini
software is excellent and supports the superb IVC; will the Nascom?
</p>
<p>
I have no reservations in recommending this system. No disks are
cheap, but this package costs little different to most. A great deal of
thought has gone into the CP/M BIOS making the CP/M on this system a lot nicer
and easier to get on with than on any other I&rsquo;ve used (and I have used quite a
few). The author (David Parkinson, I believe) has to be congratulated on his
work.
</p>
<p>
On the hardware side, the system is fast, stores a respectable 350K
per drive (340K without the system/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>directory track), and has been absolutely
100% reliable in the thrashing that I have been giving it. With the IVC my
&lsquo;Nascom&rsquo;(?) is no longer a hobbyist&rsquo;s toy, but a professional system
</p>
<p>
One minor closing niggle though, Gemini. Considering the overall cost
of this lot, howsabout throwing in the Zaks book for free? Then it&rsquo;s
unbeatable!
