Old-time INMC readers may remember some articles which I wrote about the
<?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> and the &ldquo;Nascom One-Two&rdquo;, which were a result of trying to interface a
Nascom&nbsp;1 to my Nascom&nbsp;2 to act as a &ldquo;Giant Intelligent Print Buffer&rdquo;. I am
pleased to report that my trusty Nascom&nbsp;1 (one of the first) sits under my
printer waiting for interrupts, and always faithfully responds.
</p>
<p>
My system seemed complete&nbsp;&ndash; until the age of the floppy disk. Unable to
resist the compulsion, I soon had a disk system. I never imagined how much I
would learn about microcomputing by that move. My first impression of CP/M
was that it was crude and unfriendly, but now I have known it for some time I
can forgive its faults and enjoy the benefits of the superb software which is
available to run under it, such as the Microsoft languages (Basic, Fortran,
Cobol) and most importantly the Z80 assembler/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>linker, Macro&nbsp;80. My Nascom now
provides quite a powerful software development system, even though I use its
abilities only to develop it further.
</p>
<p>
When I first ran CP/M, an immediate problem arose&nbsp;&ndash; I had lost my printer
interface software, and there was no obvious way to get it back! The official
method is to patch the CP/M image generated by MOVCPM. To be fair, that is
quite possible, with patience, but is a poor solution. Also, each different
size system would have to be patched separately. The even more official
solution, which is restricted to CP/M distributors, is to patch the BIOS module
which is part of MOVCPM. I have since learned how to perform this procedure,
and it is quite horrible. Even if I had had the official CP/M redistribution
disk I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to use that method.
</p>
<p>
It was then that after much thought SYS was invented. SYS is a special
CP/M program which consists of a new BIOS, together with a program which
relocates this BIOS automatically for any size CP/M system, and slots it into
place where the original BIOS used to be. The BIOS is the part of CP/M which
contains all the input and output routines. All that remained was to get SYS
to run automatically when CP/M was started up. Originally I solved that
problem by using a special boot ROM which pretended to be a keyboard with a
person sitting at it typing in &ldquo;SYS&rdquo;. In more recent versions of SYS a better
method has been used, which requires only a tiny patch to MOVCPM. This runs
SYS on a cold boot, but not on a warm boot, which would be pointless. SYS can
now be configured in many ways. For example there are four configurations for the
Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?><?php externalLink("Henelec"); ?>
single density disk card. These are for CP/M&nbsp;1.4 and CP/M
2.2 with or without the Gemini video card.
</p>
<p>
SYS has developed quite a few features over the generations. Firstly it
meets the original intention of supplying good printer support by handling
serial printers with optional handshaking and optional automatic page throw,
and also Centronics compatible parallel interfaces. My personal version
supports an interrupt driven interface to my Nascom&nbsp;1. Secondly it provides a
most unusual feature for CP/M systems&nbsp;&ndash; screen editing. Once one is used to
screen editing, for example with NAS-SYS, it is very hard to return to the old
days. The screen editing works in a similar way to NAS-SYS, except that a key
must be pressed once at the start of each line to enter screen edit
mode. This also works with the Gemini video card, and it is nice to be able
to hop back up the screen and reenter incorrect CP/M commands, or even 80
character long lines of a Basic program. Another feature is screen dump,
which means that when you press a certain key, the contents of the screen is
printed out.
