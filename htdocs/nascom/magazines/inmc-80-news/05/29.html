If all is well, plug in the PSG chip (taking precautions against static
charges), cross your fingers and switch on. Hopefully everything should
now work,

<h4>
Addressing the PSG:
</h4>
<p>
This is very simple &ndash; select a register by writing to port 8 and then
load it or read from it with port 9.
</p>
<p>
eg. to load register 7 (PSG output enable) with 244 (tone channels A
and B, noise channel A enabled) simply write:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 20%">
(BASIC)      OUT8,7:0UT9,244

(ASSEMBLER)  LD A,#07
             OUT (8),A
             LD A,#F4
             OUT(9),A
</pre>
<p>
And to read, say register 7:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 20%">
(BASIC)      OUT8,7:PRINT INP(9)

(ASSEMBLER)  LD A, #07
             OUT (8),A
             IN A,(9)
             :Contents now in A
</pre>
<h4>
Further ideas:
</h4>
<p>
If you anticipate using several PSGs in your system, try using a <?php externalLink("2708"); ?>
EPROM to decode the address bus and control signals. The eight outputs
could be paired to provide the BC1 and BDIR signals for four PSGs.
Optional simultaneous access to all of them would be possible (in the
write mode anyway) and the hardware would be much easier and cheaper to
build.
