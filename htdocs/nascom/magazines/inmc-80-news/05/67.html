that works, but the problem recurs, replace the rectifier. I know of one case
where the rectifier was replaced by a 6&nbsp;amp rated device, which was bolted to
the case. The connections were made from the P.C. Board in heavy wire. No
further problems occurred on either of the machines I know of that could be
attributed to the P.S.U.

Has anyone heard of the National Semiconductor MM58174 Microprocessor
Compatible Real Time Clock? This is a very neat 16 pin i.c. which costs about
10.00 (depending where you buy it). It requires a 38768Hz clock from a crystal
controlled oscillator. It can run in power down mode as low as 2.2V, and keeps
a track of time from 1/10 sec to leap years! It offers the option of interrups
on 0.5 sec, 5.0 sec, 60 sec. Would any highly intelligent person who has
designed a circuit for this to run on a Nascom like to send me a copy?

I would like to thank the people who wrote to me with information
about the IBM33FD floppy disks. The day they start to run is coming nearer. I
intend, subject to changing my mind about the matter, to drive them from an
input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output board, having cunningly substituted an <?php externalLink("Z80 SIO", "SIO"); ?> for the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>. Beware!!
The SIO is not pin-compatible, and an adap&shy;ter is necessary. Also the SIO does
not calculate the CRC with the correct initialisation to give IBM&nbsp;3740
standard, so disks recorded in this way are system dependant. However doing it
this way will allow me to see if there is any point in going further with
these disk units, or if I throw them away (having first removed the stepper
motors for a plotter) and buy some real 8&Prime; Shugarts or Qumes. Should this
method of driving them work, in spite of being system dependent, I intend to
build a Z80 based disk controller, which will be intelligent enough to handle
the spooling of data to a printer, and perhaps even tape input and output.
I&rsquo;ve recently acquired an NCR 6000&nbsp;baud tape unit, which is also intelligent
I&rsquo; m now using the term very loosely!

My reference to the method of checking the capture range of this

The reference to the A.C.C. newsletter should have been to Vol 6,

<p>
It would give me, and I&rsquo;m sure many other Nascomers, the greatest
satisfaction to hear that the **** who designed (&ldquo;designed&rdquo;? Daddy, Daddy, I
thought you said it was **** . Ouch, oh!) the Famous Nascom series A RAM board
had been shot at dawn, without benefit of a) a blindfold, b) a final
cigarette. If I knew his name, I could label my picture of Hitler with it, and
throw darts at it.
