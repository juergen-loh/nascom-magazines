In this Pascal, the data type Character has been replaced with a
STRING type, where a string is up to 255 characters long. Predefined functions
allow for the manipulation of these strings in much the same way as we have
learned in BASIC. (Go and wash your mouth out with soap!) Predefined PLOT and
POINT allow easy interface with the Nascom Graphics.
</p>
<p>
As you can see from the preceding list, a fairly full subset of Pascal
is supported. The omission of Sets, user-definable types (including records)
and file types is to be regretted, but can be programmed round with a little
ingenuity. Figures are supplied of the PCW benchmark times for this package.
Running at 4MHz, with one waitstate, it is faster than an <?php externalLink("Apple&nbsp;II","Apple&nbsp;2"); ?> and a
Heathkit H11A, which uses an LSI 11/2 16 bit processor! How much faster, you
ask? In round figures, it is three times faster than the APPLE, and in
general, twice as fast as the Heathkit. It loses out to the Heathkit on the
Real algebra and Maths tests, where the LSI 11 beats it, but is still
comfortably faster on all other tests, particularly on the housekeeping
overheads. In addition, it offers 11+ significant digits, whilst the APPLE is
only offering 6+ !
</p>
<p>
The arithmetic accuracy is remarkable &ndash; the strings of figures
marching across the screen will impress even the uninitiated, but when you
hear that it has predefined the ability to format figures to so many decimal
places, in fields of a predefined width, you will realise that this package is
a must for number crunchers!
</p>
<p>
It is to be hoped that in the future the authors will expand this
package to include set operations, and user defined types &ndash; perhaps even
variant records? In spite of the omission of these, this package is quite
capable of doing anything an extended BASIC can do, and doing it considerably
quicker.

There will be points I have not covered in this review, due to
limitations of space and/or time (I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d rather have the review in
this INMC80 rather than the next one) but your Nascom dealer will be able to
help you. Any errors and omissions are regretted, but neither I nor the INMC80
committee, or anyone else are responsible. (Responsible for what? &ndash; Ed.)
