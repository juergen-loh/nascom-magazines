The Editor kindly gave me the opportunity to preview the responses to
&lsquo;The Great BUS Debate&rsquo; which are included in this issue. I have concluded that
many feel that Gemini and Nascom are converging on a collision course, and
whilst there are some areas of direct competition, the recent radical moves on
our part as far as software is concerned should ensure that a conflict of this
nature will not take place. Gemini have adopted a CP/M look-alike monitor
called RP/M (produced by Richard Beal, the author of Nasbug T4 and Nas-Sys&nbsp;1&amp;3),
which means that customers starting with a ROM based system can move on
to CP/M without making any changes whatsoever to their software, simply
transferring the programs from tape or EPROM to disk with the routines
provided. Nascom, however, for historic reasons continue to primarily follow
the path of Nas-Sys.
</p>
<p>
The customer therefore has two clear choices &ndash; a single board Nascom
approach, or the Gemini MultiBoard approach. In order to allow the user to
expand his system and exploit its potential to the fullest, the adoption of
one BUS would mean that peripheral manufacturers would have two basic systems
to supply with the same product, thereby reducing costs dramatically. Surely
this must be to the benefit of all of Nascom and Gemini customers?

Here I sit, 11&nbsp;o&rsquo;clock at night typing away at the keyboard of my
trusty Nascom, after a hard days slacking. Anyway, that&rsquo;s enough of my tales
of woe, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m writing about.
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s a bit for CP/M disk systems. Those of you who have a disk system
running CP/M&nbsp;1.4, (and lets face it, judging by the number of people seen
carrying away expensive boxes from the various dealers, there must be plenty
around), will probably have noticed the fact that when a directory exceeds 13
entries it scrolls off the screen of the Nascom. Well here&rsquo;s a small program
that can be entered under ZSID or DDT which will give a three column directory
display. It is executed in the following fashion:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td><pre>A&gt;CAT</pre></td><td>Which will list all the directory entries on drive A</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>A&gt;CAT d:</pre></td><td>Which will list all the directory entries on drive d:</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>A&gt;CAT filename.typ</pre></td><td>Which will list all the directory entries with the
             unambiguous filename.typ on drive A.</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>A&gt;CAT d:filename.typ</pre></td><td>Which will list all the directory entries with the
             unambiguous filename.typ on drive d:.</td></tr>
</table>
