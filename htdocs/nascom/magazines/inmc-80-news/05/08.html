Dear Sirs
</p>
<p>
I am writing to you in response to the letter from Mr Scadden published in
<a href="../text/#article1"></a>Issue&nbsp;4 of INMC&nbsp;80 News. We knew that Nascom owners are enthusiasts, but
building three in a week is certainly rather unusual. Keep up the good
work!
</p>
<p>
Regarding the points made by Mr Scadden we would like to make our position
clear as the new owners of Nascom.
</p>
<p>
1. All Nascom manuals used to be produced by photocopying, and as a result
the occurrence of angled pages was not unknown. Since we have taken over we
have been modifying and restructuring parts of the manual, and have in the
process converted to a printing process for the entire manual. This will
eliminate the problem described, but in the meantime anyone with faulty
pages supplied by ourselves will be sent new copies of the page concerned
on request.
</p>
<p>
2. Any components in Nascom kits which were faulty on delivery will be
replaced free of charge by the dealer from whom the kit was purchased.
Faulty boards have been known to occur occassionally in the past, but we
hope that we have now managed to eliminate this problem. Any such faults
should be taken up with the dealer from whom the equipment was purchased,
who can contact us on the subject if necessary.
</p>
<p>
As both I and the Editor have indicated problems should be dealt with in
the first instance by the dealer who supplied the equipment, since it is
much easier to resolve such matters in person rather than via the
telephone. However, if you feel you are not receiving fair treatment you
can of course contact us subsequently.
</p>
<p>
Finally I can assure Mr Scadden and other readers that there are some
interesting new products in the pipeline &ndash; depending on the date of <a href="../text/#article1"></a>issue
of the next copy of <a href="../text/#article1"></a>INMC&nbsp;80 News they may already be available&nbsp;. Like Mr
Scadden I look forward to receiving my INMC&nbsp;80 newsletters.
