<u class="uppercase">Nasbug To NAS-SYS</u>
</h3>
<p>
I have bought several programs from the INMC80 library for my minimum
Nascom&nbsp;1 with Nas-Sys, but not all the Nasbug programs are available for
Nas-Sys. So I decided to modify those that weren&rsquo;t available. The first was
Life by J Haigh and this is how it goes:
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
<?php columnStart(1, "noindent"); ?>
<p>
1. Load the program from 0C80 instead of 0C50. It still fits easily into the
minimum system.
</p>
<p>
2. Apply the following patches (shown as address, old contents, new contents)
</p>
<?php columnStart(6); ?>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-11-2.png"); ?>
<?php columnChange(6); ?>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-11-3.png"); ?>
<?php columnChange(6); ?>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-11-4.png"); ?>
<?php columnChange(6); ?>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-11-5.png"); ?>
<?php columnEnd(6); ?>
<p>
3) Now save it! The result is well worth the effort &ndash; a very interesting
program.
</p>
<p>
Two of the patches were applied because of (non-serious) errors in the
listing.
</p>
<p>
1) Centre of screen (ff)<br>
2) Population count (m)
</p>
<p>
Spurred on by my success, I started on Robots, but my cassette recorder failed
me and work stopped. I hope to report success eventually.
