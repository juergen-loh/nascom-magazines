The Generate command in Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 automatically loads and starts a
program. However if the &lsquo;Execute&rsquo; address which is given to start the program
is merely the address of the DF 5B monitor return instruction in that program
(There is not a DF 5B?!! &ndash; go and read the manual on how to end a program)
then the only action will be to return to monitor control.
</p>
<p>
A second program may now be entered automatically by using the same
process. The second program need not contain a DF 5B provided the address of
the DF 5B in the first program is given as the &lsquo;Execute&rsquo; address when
recording the second program using the Generate command. Subsequent programs
may be similarly entered. Thus a cassette tape may be prepared which will load
any number of programs (or a main program and several subroutines) without the
need to enter a single command via the keyboard. No program will be executed
until the command is given either manually or as the execute address of the
final program/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>subroutine which is loaded.
</p>
<p>
The individual programs or subroutines need not occupy adjacent blocks
of memory and no &lsquo;unoccupied&rsquo; memory need be recorded on the tape as would be
necessary if the whole group were widespread through memory and were then
saved as a single program.
