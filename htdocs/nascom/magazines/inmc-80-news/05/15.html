Now as regards alternative main boards and systems, I know that
interest and hope during the past year, of any future, has depended a great
deal on the INMC committee, but also on those who now wish to follow parallel
commercial paths. The membership owe them some support. Would it be possible
to open a &lsquo;Compatible System&rsquo; section at the rear of the mag to allow these to
be commented on and advertized. The size of this section could increase (or
decrease) dependent on the future related membership, subscription fee,
increased committee size to deal with the increased work load, etc. No doubt
Lucas would object to competitive adverts, but competition is good for
inspiration and could only benefit future customers, which, in part will
become part of the future membership.&nbsp;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Unless, that is, Lucas intend
offer us all discounts, or something for exclusive rights!!&nbsp;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;

Dear Ed,
</p>
<p>
Having galvanized myself into action, I have a couple of comments to make.
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 50%">
<colgroup><col style="width: 70%"><col></colgroup>
<tr><td>Nasbus (80-BUS&nbsp;? etc)</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nascom only</td><td>No</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If the opinion need justification, then I feel that most Nascom owners
want the most from their machines and hence need to know about products
as many sources as possible. Lucas may be wonderful (correction:
wonderful, they bought Nascom) and should obviously be given a chance,
then so should Winchester Technology, Gemini, Arfon, I/O Devices, etc.
</p>
<p>
Etc.

Dear Sirs,
</p>
<p>
Briefly:
</p>
<p>
1) INMC80 is and should remain primarily a Nascom users magazine/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>club.
</p>
<p>
2) It follows that all peripheral products using Nasbus/80-BUS or the
Nascom serial or parallel interfaces and all software compatible with Nascom,
whoever makes or markets them should fall within the scope of INMC80.
</p>
<p>
3) Other computers following very closely on Nascom software and
hardware conventions may be included if the arguments proposed are relevant to
Nascom users. Other computers using the same bus but not the same hardware/
software conventions should be excluded.
</p>

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
By all means support the Nasbus, but keep the INMC80 Nascom. I
thoroughly agree with John N. S. Deane when he says that supporting rival
products would mean becoming like all the other computing mags.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it seems strange that INMC80 is considering dropping Nascom
(well almost) when Program Power are launching a new Nascom only magazine
a mere 95p a copy.
