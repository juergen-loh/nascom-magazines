Anyway, to business, to date we&rsquo;ve been through most of the important
bits of learning to program in machine assembler. Yes believe it or not, you
have. From now on in it&rsquo;s learning the tricks of the trade and figuring it out
for yourself. Of course there are thousands of little tricks that can be
learned, but most of these will either come with practice, or by pinching them
from elsewhere. As far as pinching ideas from elsewhere goes, every Nascom
owner has a complete library of software waiting to be lifted. Yup, you got it,
NAS-SYS (or <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span>). It&rsquo;s completely within the rules to use bits of the
monitor as a guide for things that you might find difficult to figure out for
yourself. That&rsquo;s why the complete listing has been provided, and in Richard&rsquo;s
view (he wrote <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span> T4 and both NAS-SYSii) imitation is the sincerest form of
flattery (I know, &rsquo;cos I asked him). If anyone wanted to make a complete
mystery of the monitor, they would not have published the listing, like some
other machines I could mention. So, try to understand the monitor. The comments
are a bit brief (where they exist), because the monitors were written with the
aid of the ZEAP assembler, and at the time Richard only had 32K of RAM to work
in. So it meant that there wasn&rsquo;t much space to waste on comments. I&rsquo;m not
suggesting you kick the moggie out of the comfy chair and sit down and digest
the lot in one go. If you did manage it, I doubt that you&rsquo;d remember much of
what you read, and even less understand it. No, break it up into nice little
chunks. Pick the shorter and easier routines first, and, if you&rsquo;ll take my
advice, leave the KBD routine till last. If you start on the KBD routine, you
WILL end up on the funny farm.

<p>
As my contribution to the exercise, I&rsquo;m going to attempt to describe
the routine known as B2HEX. I&rsquo;ve chosen this one, partly because it&rsquo;s short,
partly because for the most part it&rsquo;s easy, and mainly because the later
version in NAS-SYS employs one of those programming tricks by way of example.
The listing below is from NAS-SYS&nbsp;3, but apart from its absolute address, it&rsquo;s
identical to the NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 version. Now remember from the last episode I
mentioned the need to make the labels mean something, well B2HEX is the epitome
of the cryptic label writer&rsquo;s art. Those of you who complete the TIMES
crossword on the way to work will have got it already. For those not so quick
on the uptake, B2HEX means &lsquo;Binary To HEX&rsquo;. Neat isn&rsquo;t it?
</p>
<p>
Before we get bogged down in the innards of B2HEX, there are a few
things that have to be explained. Firstly, lets get a few definitions out of
the way. A nibble!? This is an expression that has crept into use with 4 bit
processors. A 16 bit processor works with 16 bits WORDs, an 8 bit processor
works with 8 bit BYTEs, so some comedian decided that as a &lsquo;4 bit unit&rsquo; was
half a BYTE, the definition of a ought to be a NIBBLE, and it&rsquo;s stuck. So we
have:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>16</td><td>bit WORDS</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>bit BYTES</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>bit NIBBLES</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
To date we haven&rsquo;t dealt in detail with the STACK POINTER register. Now
the STACK (that&rsquo;s the area of memory the SP points to) is rather important.
It&rsquo;s best thought of as a vertical column of pigeon holes, the top being the
highest address assigned to it, the bottom being the lowest address it reaches
in normal use. (In abnormal use, it could be anywhere and any depth, and that
is a common cause of &ldquo;crashes&rdquo; where the stack comes so far down that it
overwrites the program beneath it.) Now there are many occasions where we need
to tuck things away out of sight where they won&rsquo;t get corrupted by normal
processor register manipulations. In other words, we want to save something
till later, and then retrieve it in one piece. That&rsquo;s what the STACK is for.
The STACK normally works in pairs of pigeon holes, as more often than not, it&rsquo;s
two byte addresses we want to save. To make this process a bit more manageable,
the Z80 looks after the STACK automatically, and saves everything else in pairs
as well, so if, for instance we wanted to save the B register, we&rsquo;d actually
save the BC pair. A point to note when retrieveing data from the STACK, as when
B is restored, C is also restored to its previous value.
