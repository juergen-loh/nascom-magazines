<u>The AY-3-8910 Programmable Sound Generator Meets The NAS-BUS</u>

I am sure many readers are aware of the availability of the General
Instrument&rsquo;s <?php externalLink("General Instrument AY-3-8910","AY-3-8910"); ?> programmable sound generator (&rdquo;super-easy to
interface to the S100 and other buses&hellip;&rdquo;) from several suppliers
currently advertising in the various computer magazines.
</p>
<p>
In my innocence, I bought one of these devices and, although it&rsquo;s not
too difficult, I found that interfacing is not as straight-forward as
it first appears. I thought that my experiences and subsequent design
of a working NAS-BUS compatible board (that&rsquo;s the correct terminology
isn&rsquo;t it?) may be of interest to other <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> users.
</p>
<p>
In the first place any would-be user intending to interface and use the
PSG chip with a <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> would be well advised to study the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>
documentation (again) and to refer to several publications on using
the PSG (see list of references at end of this article). In this
respect I will not give detailed descriptions of the programming
techniques involved, but rather concentrate on the hardware considerations
specific to interfacing to the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>&nbsp;,
</p>
<h4>
What does the AY-3-8919 PSG chip do?
</h4>
<p>
The PSG chip is a complex user-programmable digital to analogue
converter specifically designed for audio sound output. The logic is
TTL compatible and is thus able to be linked to the NAS-BUS. The chip
contains 16 user-accessible resisters, each containing 4 to 8 bits
depending upon its application. Two of these registers are dedicated to
supporting the two 8-bit parallel I/O ports provided &ndash; useful for
Joysticks, A to D converters etc (handshakes and interrupts are not
catered fer). The remaining registers dictate the type of sound
generated. Three analogue outputs are provided, these can adjusted
independently for frequency and amplitude. A noise generator with
variable pitch can be mixed with any of the above outputs. There is
also an envelope generator, the profile of which can be programmed for
frequency and shape. One of the apparent strong selling points of this
device is that it will operate independently of the host CPU. This is
certainly true for continuous sounds (boring) or sounds controlled by
the envelope generator, but almost any &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; sound will require
a lot of attention by the CPU. One way of improving this situation
might be to use the <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC"); ?> chip to interrupt drive the PSG at
predefined time intervals leaving the CPU to get on with its business
most of the time. However despite this, the AY-3-8910 does produce some
amazing sounds and is very easy to operate.

<h4>
Options available for interfacing the PSG to a <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span>:
</h4>
<p>
a) Configure it as part of the memory. The articles in
<?php externalLink("Personal Computer World, October 1980, page 48","PCW"); ?>
and PE use
this approach to link the PSG to a rival (?) computer kit, using PEEK
and POKE to address it. While this is fine if you have odd memory
locations scattered around your memory map, it does no justice to a
system such as the <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> where every bit of memory may be put to
more efficient use.
</p>
<p>
b) Attach it to the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> port. This is very easy to do, however if you
adopt this approach you will soon find that it does give a large
software penalty over alternative methods: the PSG is controlled by
pulses, the timings of which may be critical, so the PIO (which gives a
latched output) must be repeatably set and reset, applying delays if
necessary, in a specific order to control the PSG. This effectively
more than doubles the the amount of software required to drive it,
making life rather tedious.
