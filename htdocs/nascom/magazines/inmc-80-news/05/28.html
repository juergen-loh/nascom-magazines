enable line from IC&nbsp;2a is also used as the NASIO signal.
Although the <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> is fitted with a switch (LSW2/8) to allow either
on-board or external ports to be used, as it stands you cannot use
both. The NASIO signal provides a means of achieving this, but
unfortunately only one signal can be fed to this line (unless you use
expensive tri-state logic) as TTL outputs don&rsquo;t like mixing with each
other. So if you intend to use more than one I/O board in the system
you must be careful. One way of catering for all eventualities is to
use the circuit in Figure 2. Fit this onto one (only) board which uses
the bus, switch LSW2/8 to &ldquo;EXT&rdquo; and forget about NASIO. There are
sufficient unused ICs in the circuit of Figure 1 to build this. If you
are using the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> I/O board, check how it handles NASIO.

<h4>
Practical details:
</h4>
<p>
Vero Electronics make an 8&Prime; x 8&Prime; copper-tracked perforated card with
gold-plated &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; (i.e. NAS-BUS compatible) for about #5 (part
number 09-0092K) and although not glass-fibre, it does present a cheap
alternative to the prototyping boards currently available for DIY
circuits, and is more than adequate for this application.
</p>
<p>
Remember that the NAS-BUS contains lines directly linked to the CPU and
other important chips in the system, so be VERY careful of what happens
to these lines when they enter your circuit. As a suggestion &ndash; letter
each track with a felt tip pen as to its function, check and then check
again before starting work. Cut any tracks carrying unused signals
(NMI, INT, HALT, A8-A15 etc.).
</p>
<p>
Layout appears not to be critical &ndash; refer to a mood TTL primer (eg. TTL
Cookbook, Lancaster) if necessary. Check for shorts, tracks still
needing to be cut etc. Test the board without the chips and check that
all voltages are in the right places. Fit the TTL devices and adjust
LSW2/8 to EXT and check that the keyboard still works, if possible
check the correct operation of the 2&nbsp;MHz clock (if you are using the
divider circuit) and the BC1 and 8DIR signals with a scope using the
following programmes:
</p>
<p>
Routine to check PSG resister latch:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 30%">
     LD A,#0F
LOOP OUT (8),A
     JP LOOP
</pre>
<p>
The BC1, BDIR, NASIO and all DATA lines should all give simultaneous
positive pulses.
</p>
<p>
Routine to check data write:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 30%">
     LD A, #0F
LOOP OUT (9),A
     JP LOOP
</pre>
<p>
The BDIR, NASIO and all DATA lines should all give simultaneous
positive pulses, BCl is kept low.
</p>
<p>
Routine to check data read:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 30%">
LOOP IN A,(9)
     JP LOOP
</pre>
<p>
BC1 and NASIO should give positive pulses, the data lines will reflect
the contents of the addressed resister and BDIR should remain low.
</p>
<p>
If WAIT states are used, these should be active (low) within the pulses
described above.
