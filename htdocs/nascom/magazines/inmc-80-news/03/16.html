We&rsquo;ve received the following from John Fisher of Ipswich who
very kindly sent us a tape which we took to be a Naspen tape. It
wasn&rsquo;t! We presume the tape was made on a text handler of his own, and
the tape format was ASCII strings, more like a Basic LIST. Still
about 5 minutes of thinking had tape loader software prepared, and the
following into a Naspen file for editing.

This is the first of a (possible) series of notes for enhancing
the performance of the NAS&shy;COM-2. The author&rsquo;s interests are to do with
pictures and signal processing and to this end I have tried to increase
the speed and memory capacity of the processor, to increase the speed
of the cassette interface and to develop a cheap and flexible way of
drawing pictures. These requirements happen to co-incide with those of
&lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; games.

<h4>
First of all the memory.
</h4>
<p>
This expands the memory of the &lsquo;32k&rsquo; RAM (A) board from 32k
(which it has already got sockets for) up to 48k. This is accomplished
by connecting a further eight dynamic RAM memory chips onto the
multiplexed address bus internal to the board. This means that only 2
additional ICs apart from the <?php externalLink("4116","",""); ?>s are needed and very little extra
wiring need be done, such that it can be done in an afternoon.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Here is a step-by-step list of the modifications needed.
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis noindent">
<li>
Connect the 8 extra 4116s piggy-backed on top of ICs 12-19,
(see diagram) with all pins paralleled except the pin 4s.<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>(Row
Address Strobe). I used sockets soldered to the backs of the
existing 4116s with the pin 4s bent up.
</li>
<li>
Connect all 8 of the new pin 4s together. This is the new
RAS3 point.
</li>
<li>
Wire up a new RAS3 driving circuit as follows:
<p>
Create a new address select pad P99. connect this to +5v via a
1k resistor <span style="float: right">( &nbsp; )</span>
</p>
<p>
Mount 2 extra ICs (38 &amp; 39). These are 74LS02 and 7432
respectively. This can be done by a small strip of Veroboard
and some doublesided Sellotape. I put the chips on top of
positions IC&nbsp;29 &amp; IC&nbsp;30. <span style="float: right">( &nbsp; )</span>
</p>
<p>
CUT the following tracks on the p.c.
</li>
</ol>
<table class="cut-connect">
<tr><th>IC</th><th>Pin</th><th>to</th><th>IC</th><th>Pin</th><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>14</td><td>+5v</td><td>36</td><td>13</td><td>( &nbsp; )</td></tr>
<tr><td>37</td><td>8</td><td></td><td>36</td><td>2</td><td>( &nbsp; )</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
CONNECT the following:

<table class="cut-connect">
<tr><th>IC</th><th>Pin</th><th>to</th><th>IC</th><th>Pin</th><td>( &nbsp; )</td></tr>
<tr><td>&ndash;</td><td>P99</td><td></td><td>36</td><td>13</td><td>( &nbsp; )</td></tr>

<tr><td>39</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>36</td><td>2</td><td>( &nbsp; )</td></tr>
<tr><td>&ndash;</td><td>P99</td><td></td><td>38</td><td>5</td><td>( &nbsp; )</td></tr>
