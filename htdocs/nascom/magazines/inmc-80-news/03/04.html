<u>Keep the Humour</u>
</h3>
<p>
Firstly,
<a href="../../../02/08/text/#article1">in reply to Dr. G R Kelman</a>,
may I say that I appreciate things like
Lawrence, Scurrilous Musings, spoof letters, and most things with humour in. Life is
too boring to be taken seriously, especially all the time, keep them coming!
</p>
<p>
Secondly, will you please credit the person who wrote the Space Invaders
program published in the
<a href="../../../02/57/text/#article1">last issue</a>.
As I am a beginner at machine code (and not much
better at BASIC?) I have put off trying to write a Space Invaders game, having given
up trying in BASIC because of the speed (or lack of it!). I would like to thank him,
albeit in his absence, but I cannot do this if I do not know who he is! [Ed&nbsp;&ndash; Sorry,
we don&rsquo;t know either!].
</p>
<p>
Come to that, I would like to thank everyone who contributes, and makes this
THE most interesting computer publication around.
</p>
<p>
There you are, the unsolicited testamonial that you promised me 10.00 for!
</p>
<p>
Please, keep up the good work, especially things like the Kiddies Guide to Z80
Programming, etc.
</p>
<p>
In fact, just keep up the good work.

<u>Modifying <span class="uppercase">Startrek</span></u>
</h3>
<p>
Many thanks for the library Programs that I purchased recently.
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/03/19/text/#article25">Space Invasion</a>,
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/06/32/text/#article5">3D Noughts and Crosses</a>,
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/06/32/text/#article7">Magic Labyrinth</a> and
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/06/32/text/#article3">Startrek</a>.
All brilliant work but
I have had trouble with the last mentioned two programs. Far be it for me to criticise
(I am only a novice) but may I make the following comments.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/06/32/text/#article7">Magic Labyrinth</a>: There is a syntax error in Line 2440. The decimal points should both
be upward arrows. (See elsewhere in
<a href="../../44/text/#article2">this issue</a>
to see why that happened&nbsp;&ndash; Ed.)
</p>
<p class="noindent">
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/06/32/text/#article3">Startrek</a>: This is written for Nascom&nbsp;2 with graphics but it does not say anything
about that on the Program. This drove me nuts until that fact dawned upon me at 3 a.m.
in the morning! Also I cannot get the machine code routine to work properly. I have a
Nascom&nbsp;1 with &ldquo;Bits &amp; P.C.s&rdquo; graphics and the result was a mightmare of chaos. For
owners of Nascom&nbsp;1 with or without graphics, may I suggest the following alterations.
Rewrite the machine code using Lines 90 to 130 inclusive with this:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-04-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Change Line 5340 to: IF I8&lt;&gt;31 GOTO 5360 (13 is not Nascom&nbsp;1 C/R)<br>
In Line 5760 and 5770 change CHR$(129) to CHR$(127)<br>
In Line 5710 change all three CHR$(&nbsp;) to suit your own particular graphics capability
and imagination. The symbols will be used as Enterprise, Klingons and Starbases
respectively.
</p>
<p>
Well that&rsquo;s it. Now it works. Anyway, it has been great fun sorting it all out
and I have learned a great deal from so doing.
