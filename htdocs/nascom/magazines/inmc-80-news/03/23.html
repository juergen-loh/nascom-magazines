<u class="double">GEMINI DISK SYSTEM</u>
</h2>
<p>
In the last issue we devoted some space to disk systems, in particular the
Gemini G805. At the time we said we didn&rsquo;t intend to review it in that issue, as the
people supplying the hints and tips had too much of a vested interest in the system
and therefore any review forthcoming from that source could hardly be objective.
Having said that, a few days later, a letter arrived from the Merseyside Nascom Users
Group, containing a review on the Gemini system using D-DOS (the simple &lsquo;floppy tape
recorder&rsquo;) software. Well although their review arrived before the last issue went
out, it was too late to include it, so we have had to hold it over until this issue.
Before we start on the review, we&rsquo;ll give a little of the history of the Gemini
system.

About March last year three people decided that it was about time that Nascom
pulled its finger out and got the long awaited disk system on the road, failing that,
they would have to do something themselves. Well it seemed that although the Nascom
disk system had been seen in the flesh, it was still no nearer completion, so Peter,
Richard C (not Beal) and I started to look around to see what made disks work, and why
Nascom were taking so long. Bolstered by a bit of spare loot from Naspen royalties
(Oh! What a give away.), and the fortuitous publication of a design discussion about a
simple disk drive system in one of the more obscure industrial magazines, Peter and
Richard beavered away for about a month, and finally phoned me, saying &ldquo;Come on over,
we&rsquo;ve got something that works&rdquo;, and it did!! There it was, a huge 10 amp power
supply, running a hand knitted 4&Prime; square vero card, surrounded by a rats nest of wires
attached to an N2 at one end, and a Shugart drive at the other. It was a rather
different approach than the American designed disk controllers available, in that
instead of giving the controller card a list of instructions and then letting the
controller card take over the bus and get on with it, it made the Z80 do most of the
work. This meant that the Z80 couldn&rsquo;t do something else whilst disk access was taking
place (as the American designs envisaged), nor could system interrupts occur during
disk access. But, what the heck, it brought the chip count down to 8, and made it
cheap compared along side its imported rivals. 99.99% of applications would not
require the Z80 to be doing anything else whilst disk access took place, and anyone
giving priority to system interrupts would just have to put up with it {or buy an
American one).

One problem caused considerable debate amongst us. We chose the Western
Digital 1771 FDC chip to do all the work, and Western Digital recommend the use of an
external data/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sync separator. Now the trouble with data/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sync separators is that they
usually use monostables and these usually need &lsquo;twiddle pots&rsquo;. &lsquo;Twiddle pots&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t a
clever idea when it comes to kits, because constuctors usually can&rsquo;t manage to set
them correctly without sophisticated test gear. A lot of effort went in to designing a
consistent data/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sync separtor which didn&rsquo;t need adjustment, and after a lot of brain
scratching Richard C came up with one. We wrote special test routines which could
count (and then recover from) &lsquo;soft errors&rsquo; and set it to work. In theory we should
get on average about one error an hour, yet after churning back and forth all day,
still no errors. Fantastic. Then someone muttered darkly that Tandy use a 1771 and get
away without any data/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sync separator at all. So we took it all off and repeated the
test. 72 hours later, still no errors (except by picking up the drive and shaking it).
Moral: who needs data/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sync separators anyway!!! Just to hedge our bets, we left pads
on the pcb to connect a data/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sync separator, just in case.
