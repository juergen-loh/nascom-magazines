The system has been working in this fashion for a week or two, and has not
exhibited any serious problems. The clock is set at 4MHz with 1 &lsquo;Wait State&rsquo;. The RAM
(A) was modified when originally used on a Nascom&nbsp;1 to cure slight &lsquo;memory plague&rsquo;, by
gridding the power tracks, and putting 6K8 pullups on the outputs of one row of
memories. The clock circuitry into the CPU has been modified slightly to improve clock
symmetry. ICl1 has been changed to a 7414 and a 270R pullup has been added between
pins 6 and 14 of IC11. R85 (33R) has been short circuited. Without the last clock mod
occasional &lsquo;soft&rsquo; errors occured, particularly when using Basic.

Finally, a couple of points about the use of D-DOS not mentioned in the notes
supplied. Firstly, D-DOS uses the area just below 1000H as stack space. If a &lsquo;READ&rsquo;
command is used to transfer data off disk into RAM at the stack address, the program
will fail. The best solution here is to &lsquo;READ&rsquo; to some other area, and then to use the
&ldquo;C&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo; commands to move the data as required. Secondly, the &lsquo;Sector&rsquo; counter used
by D-DOS can only count up to FFH sectors, after which it overflows back to 00H. The
ammount of data to fill FFH sectors occupies 32K of RAM (128 x 256 bytes). In fact,
