<u>Keyboard Help</u>
</h3>
<p>
I am trying to understand the KBD routine in the T4 Monitor and can get so far
and then come to a halt! I&rsquo;ll presevere and get there but it strikes me that a useful
inclusion in the INMC80 issues would be a section on Monitor Software; a nuts and
bolts break down of the routine. One section could be treated each issue or even
spread over two issues. I should be pleased if this suggestion were to be adopted and
would hope that others would benefit also.

<u>NAS-SYS Can Check Sums!</u>
</h3>
<p>
Many thanks for the excellent newsletters I have received since becoming an
&lsquo;INMC80&rsquo; member. All the work put in by committee members is reflected in the
interesting and helpful articles and tips. For those of you with <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span>s who have
been wondering how to print out check sums using the &ldquo;T&rdquo; command (re Mr. D. Tucker&rsquo;s
program for Nasbug monitors in
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/05/07/text/#article2">issue&nbsp;5</a>), try the following:
</p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-09-2.png"); ?>
<p>
Then activate the following routine by storing its address for the jump vector $UOUT,
which is at address 0C77:
</p>
<pre class="indent2">
0C77  C3 80 0C   $UOUT :  JP UOUT
</pre>
<p>
Now, to &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; the facility of ignoring backspaces (as produced by the
Tabulate command to delete check soms), type U. To revert to normal CRT output, type
N.
</p>
<p>
If you are using Richard Beal&rsquo;s &ldquo;keyboard Repeater&rdquo;, then type in the routine
UOUT at address 0C80, and modify address 0CA7 onwards as shown below:
</p>
<pre class="indent2">
0CA7  21 80 0C   LD  HL,UOUT
0CAA  22 78 OC   LD  ($UOUT+1),HL
0CAD  DF 5B      SCAL ZMRET
</pre>
<p>
Now the vector at $UOUT, together with the keyboard repeat data, is loaded for
you when you type E0C90.
</p>

Yours Nastaligically,<br>
Rob Sheratt, Taynton.
