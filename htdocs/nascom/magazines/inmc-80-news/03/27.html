Keyboard/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Disk Problem
</h2>
<p>
Whilst on the subject of disks, our thanks to one intrepid gentleman who has
fitted his CP/M disk system to a Nascom&nbsp;1. Now it is well known that some Nascom&nbsp;ls
will run quite happily at 4&nbsp;MHz, and even if they don&rsquo;t then a bit of RAM swopping and
changing the Z80 will usually bring them into line. Even so, there have been recurring
reports of unreliability for no apparent reason, and this has usually been put down to
&lsquo;a slow chip somewhere&rsquo;. Well Mr. Hodgson has an N1, which until he fitted his disk
system, would work perfectly at 2&nbsp;MHz, and &lsquo;so so&rsquo; at 4&nbsp;MHz. Odd occasions when things
became unreliable, but generally speaking, Ok. Well on went the disk system, and it
worked perfectly at 2&nbsp;MHz but not at all at 4&nbsp;MHz.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hodgson took up the challenge to see what was happening, his investigation
led to a most intriguing solution. As Holmes is quoted as saying, &ldquo;When you have
eliminated the possible, then what ever is left no matter how impossible....&rdquo; {or
words to that effect). Mr. Hodgson was left with the keyboard&nbsp;!!!! The keyboard has a
monostable which times the keyboard counter reset pulse. He found that the reset pulse
was just a &lsquo;nth&rsquo; too long and that it didn&rsquo;t come off until just after the first
counter pulse arrived. Reducing the value of the timing resistor not only put the
keyboard counter straight, but cured all the other unreliability problems as well. His
CP/M burst into life at 4&nbsp;MHz, the fridge which caused occasional &lsquo;crashes&rsquo; no longer
had any effect, spurious noise from other sources no longer corrupted programs, in
fact, perfect. We can see how this problem could inhibit correct keyboard function,
but as to the rest...well? Still in desparation this one is worth a try.

Multi-mapping a Nascom&nbsp;2

When I recently added a Dual Disk System to my Nascom&nbsp;2, I wanted to be able
to switch between various operating options. On the one hand the CP/M system is superb
in its file handling capabilities and there is extensive software support. On the
other hand, the standard &lsquo;ASM&rsquo; and &lsquo;DDT&rsquo; utilities are 8080 code handlers, and &lsquo;ED&rsquo; is
rather clumsy to use when it comes to editing source code. &lsquo;EBASIC&rsquo; is quite similar
to other 8K Basics in its features, apart from some of the file handling commands, and
again, it is necessary to construct source files using &lsquo;ED&rsquo;. So until I obtain
MACRO80, MBASIC and DISKPEN and other software more suited to the Z80 CPU and Nascom
hardware, there is considerable attractiveness in being able to use ZEAP, NAS-SYS, ROM
BASIC, NASDIS, NASPEN, as well as commercial software such as Chess, etc, that I have.
</p>
<p>
Most of the Nascom software will run in RAM (although you must have the tape
version of ZEAP); there is a large number of options available to users on how to map
their Nascom, depending on how much RAM or ROM is used and its addressing. The system
described in this article is only one way of obtaining a high degree of flexibilty,
