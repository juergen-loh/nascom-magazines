and a 26 way ribbon cable terminated in a plug to fit a Nascom&nbsp;2 PIO socket. The case
and finish are of a very high standard. Along with the disk drive is a power supply
which gives +5V at about 1 amp, and +12V at about 2 amps. These supplies are adequate
for two drives and the controller card. We noted that the controller card also
requires a &ndash;5V supply, but this is derived from a voltage doubler on the controller
card fed from the clock. Again the power supply and controller card are constructed to
a very high standard. The controller board uses the Western Digital 1771 Floppy Disk
Controller (FDC) and is configured to give double sided single density operation on up
to three drives if required. It is possible to get double density, however, a number
of problems exist which make this unfeasible. The only reservation we have about the
controller board is that it uses the internal data/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sync separator of the 1771. Western
Digital themselves recommend an external chip for this function. However, we have had
no problems in this area, and the board has been made so that one could be fitted at a
later date if necessary. We also received the complete circuit diagrams of the
controller card (because we asked for it). We understand the circuits are not normally
supplied. The Pertec 250 drive, as we have already said, is used in double sided,
single density mode in this system, and is configured as follows:

35 tracks per side<br>
18 sectors per track<br>
128 bytes per sector<br>
all to IBM standrds<br>
161.28K maximum formatted capacity

Cable is supplied to connect two drives. We don&rsquo;t know what you are supposed to do if
you wish to run three drives. Worth clarifying with the dealers if you have that
number in mind.

<h4>
The Software
</h4>
<p>
D-DOS is normally supplied in two EPROMs assembled to run at B000H, but we
understand is also available, to special order, in either <?php externalLink("2716","",""); ?>, or on tape assembled
to run at 8800H if you already have a Bits &amp; PCs Toolkit sitting at B000H. The first
1K (B0000-B3FFH) consists of control software for the FDC. This includes a number of
low level routines to control the PIO. It also initializes the FDC controller, drives,
and positions the heads on track 0. Re-try software is also included which in the
event of a read error makes five attempts at reading then moves the head out,
repositions it, and has five more tries. If this fails, then it returns to the command
level with an error message. No listing is supplied of this 1K but it is well worth
disassembling because a number of routines exist which are not otherwise mentioned;
for example, a power on boot which will load track 0 sector 1 into RAM at 1000H and
then execute it. Assuming you have the ability to program EPROMs, alter the jump at
B000H to B385H to make use of this feature. We hope our mentioning this doesn&rsquo;t upset
the supplier too much. With this in mind, you will have to find the other routines
yourselves.

<p>
The second EPROM (B400-B7FFH) consists of the main DOS and gives you four
simple commands to control the disk, as follows:
</p>
<dl class="indent">
<dt>N</dt><dd>Return to NAS-SYS</dd>
<dt>R</dt><dd>Read from disk</dd>
<dt>W</dt><dd>Write to disk</dd>
<dt>F</dt><dd>Format disk</dd>
</dl>
<p class="noindent">
The middle two need five parameters to be specified as follows:
</p>
<pre>
R aaaa nn tt ss dd
</pre>
<p class="noindent">
Which translates thus
</p>
<dl>
<dt>aaaa</dt><dd>Initial address to read data to</dd>
<dt>nn</dt><dd>Number of sectors to be read (128 bytes per sector)</dd>
<dt>tt</dt><dd>First track to read from</dd>
<dt>ss</dt><dd>First sector to read from</dd>
<dt>dd</dt><dd>Drive to read from</dd>
</dl>
