Below is a list of names and addresses of people who would like to contact others in
their area with a view to self-help, starting a local club, and probably a good excuse
for a drink or three! If any other people would like to start something along these
lines, then just send us a note of your name, address and/or telephone number.
(Preferably on the back of a fiver!!)
