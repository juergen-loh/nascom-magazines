<h3>
<u>ONGOING HARDWARE SITUATION</u>
</h3>
<p>
Everyone will, I hope, be glad to hear that Marvin is now fully recovered from
his recent illness. The problem was finally traced to two places; even after the 8 amp
p.s.u. had been replaced (it was producing spikes at about 10&nbsp;MHz) there was still the
occaisional glitch. An oscilloscope revealed that there was noise on the mains, even
when the scope itself was the only thing switched on in the house. If you find you
have this problem, (and be very careful how you look for it, please, as I don&rsquo;t want
to lose any readers!) there is a simple cure, that is very cheap. Wire into the plug
that goes into the back of the 8 amp unit a &ldquo;delta capacitor&rdquo;. The 3 amp unit never
needed this, and I am not sure why the huge capacitor in the 8 amp unit doesn&rsquo;t seem
to stop all the noise. Delta caps are available from Maplin, and if you haven&rsquo;t got
their catalogue, I don&rsquo;t know how you manage. Perhaps you all live near component
shops?

<u>THE &ldquo;ASKING FOR IT&rdquo; SECTION.</u>

<p class="noindent">
There are three reasons for this section:

<colgroup><col style="width: 3em"><col></colgroup>
<tr><td>1.</td><td>To help me to find more things to write about, thus preventing us all from
becoming bored to death by unknown opcodes (however, see really interesting
section, further on).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>To make life easier for the committee by enabling those of you who want to write
to me about this column, or any other vaguely Nascom related subject, to write
direct. (Far be it from me to mention the fact that this would mean I got your
letters a little sooner, on account of how busy the committee are!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>There really were three reasons, but I am not sure what the final one was.
Perhaps I just want to get lots of post!</td></tr>

I don&rsquo;t promise to answer all, or even any letters, in case there is a great
flood of them; I will try to, however. I&rsquo;ve just remembered reason number three. The
idea was to speed up the appearance of feed-back generated by these articles, which,
in combination with the hoped for (I have this in writing from a member of the
committee!) reduction in the gaps between issues of INMC80, should make it easier to
understand whatever is that I am rambling on about..... Dare I mention that I have
just thought of a fourth reason? Yes. Anyone near here want to start a sort of
informal Nascom fan club?

<u>VARIETY, THE SPICE OF LIFE, OR SOMETHING</u>

I think it would be a good thing to let the users of the mystery system that
is Nasbus compatible share our magazine. Mind you, heaven knows what the users of the
Gemini (or is that the wrong name?) will make of this column!

Once upon a time, yours truly used to write several draft versions of each of
these episodes. Then they would be typed out, and sent to INMC80, who re-typed them
before printing them. This was time consuming, as well as unkind to trees. (Some of my
