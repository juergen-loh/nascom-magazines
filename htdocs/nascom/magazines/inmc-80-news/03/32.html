So far we have learned to count with the aid of eight fingers two thumbs and
six assorted toes (unless you are lucky enough to have grown the necessary extra three
fingers on each hand), we have looked at what goes into making up machine code
instructions by making use of a spare #1,000 train set (or perhaps you tried it in
real life by hiring a redundant BR marshalling yard for a weekend). We have also
looked at the unpredictable results of giving the processor the wrong codes to work
with, and had a look around the innards of the Z80 in general. Now its &lsquo;crunch time&rsquo;.
We&rsquo;re acutally going to write a program. Well not so much a program, more of a .... er
.... well, stupid little thing that can only really count as a program because it
actually does something, not much, but something.
</p>
<p>
This is the story of how I came to be involved with these mind bending
machines, and how I wrote my first program. Bear in mind that at time I had only the
sketchiest idea of what it was all about, and, although you might swear at the
incomprehensibility of the documentation, it was a darned sight worse then than it is
now.

<h4>
First, capture your Nascom
</h4>
<p>
It was, I think, in April in the year of &rsquo;78 that I was sent forth by my
superiors. My quest, to capture, dead or alive, a Nascom&nbsp;1 from the shrine of the
Lynx, situated in the dark and mysterious nether depths of Bucks, some leagues from my
abode. I drove to Chesham and parked my trusty (or, in truth, I should say rusty)
chariot in the parking place thoughtfully provided for the purpose by the elders of
the Council of Chesham. I walked with trepidation up Broad Street, thinking that the
name was ill devised, save for the purpose of confusing the finder by its very
inappropriateness. Past the forboding gloom of the funeral parlour (I looked for black
ravens or other evil birds, but there were none) and for the first time, approached
the shrine of the Almighty. Finding a door marked with the sign of the Lynx (and
sundry other unlikely names) I entered into a dark and smokey hall which seemed full
in equal parts of cardboard boxes, plastic foam, semiconductor components and small
gnomes scurrying about, all, so it seemed, answering to the name of Heather. I asked a
passing gnome, &ldquo;May I see G.., er, I mean Mr Marshall please.&rdquo;, and was told to hang
on (which I did with difficulty as the cardboard boxes were stacked mighty high, and
wobbled a lot). At last He approached. &ldquo;Mr. Marshall,&rdquo; I said, grovelling on the
floor, putting on my best ingraciating smirk, and touching the old forelock (which is
now quite grey through the frustration which the Almighty bestowed upon me as I left).
A giant (amongst the gnomes) looked on, somewhat bemused I remember. &ldquo;Mr. Marshall,&rdquo;
said I, my voice trembling before this awe inspiring creature, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from XXXXX&rsquo;s and
we&rsquo;ve been advertising these Nascom&nbsp;1 things for about three months, I&rsquo;ve got a
waiting list that has filled up my little note book, and we still haven&rsquo;t had one to
play with. Can I please,&rdquo; grovel, grovel, &ldquo;take one away so I can see what the heck it
is I&rsquo;m selling.&rdquo; The Almighty spoke, &ldquo;My son, take thy leave of this place carrying
thy doom away in this cardboard carton, and may the curse of computing be upon thee
from this day forward.&rdquo; I left as quickly as I might, in great fear that the precious
cardboard box would be stolen from me ere I reached the door. I had actually escaped
with my life from the dread shrine with a treasured Nascom a full week before anyone
else got one. And, low, there were not the expected bolts of lightning, nor thunder
claps nor plagues of silicon chips persuing me up Chesham High Street. I hadn&rsquo;t even
seen a fiery dragon (the bemused one still looked on, perhaps he was pretending to be
the dragon that day, but he showed no tendency to burst into flames). I regained my
trusty chariot in great haste imagining my fate, should I be mobbed by hordes of
waiting Nascom Customers who had perhaps already heard that I had escaped with some of
the treasure in the cardboard carton. I went home.
