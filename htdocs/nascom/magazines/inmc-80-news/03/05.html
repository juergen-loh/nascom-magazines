<h3>
<u>NM Documentation OK&nbsp;!</u>
</h3>
<p>
As anew member may I first of all congratulate the Committee on an excellent
publication which is both highly informative and yet very readable.
</p>
<p>
I would like to make a couple of comments. The first is with regard to the
criticism, by some of your correspondents, of the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>-2 documentation. Having had
experience of the documentation supplied with other micros, I was absolutely delighted
when I received the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> manual. Obviously it contains the odd error, or is brief in
places, but compared with other manufacturers&rdquo; manuals I think it is to be commended
not condemned. It cannot be expected to be &ldquo;all things to all users&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
My second comment concerns possible future articles. I consider myself a
reasonably competent BASIC programmer and am slowly beginning to feel my way around
using machine code. However, my knowedge at the more technical side of the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> is
very limited. Would it therefore be possible for someone to prepare a few &lsquo;noddy&rsquo;
articles on&nbsp;, say, general electronics (how does a decoupling capacitor work, tips on
using multimeters etc) and perhaps on certain aspects of the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> design.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I read with a sinking heart the debate in your pages on running BASIC
without WAIT. I have difficulty running BASIC with WAIT! My system appears to have an
undocumented&nbsp;&ndash; &lsquo;Trample-on and change string&rsquo; function. In large programs strings are
corrupted&nbsp;&ndash; particularly when involved in routines printing to the top line of the
screen. Result&nbsp;&ndash; the program eventually fails or, occasionally, BASIC crashes
completely. I do not think this is anything to do with the dreaded &lsquo;Plague&rsquo; but I do
not have any idea where to start looking for a solution&nbsp;&ndash; has anyone else had this
problem?

<u>LOAD Nasbug tapes into Nas-Sys</u>
</h3>
<p>
Other members who, like me, have upgraded from <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span> T2 to NAS-SYS may find
the following program useful. It solves the problem of what to do with all those
programs that were saved on cassette using <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span>, but won&rsquo;t load under NAS-SYS.
</p>
<p>
It is an adaptation of the <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span> cassette Load sub-routine, running under
NAS-SYS. One difference between it and the original &lsquo;L&rsquo; Command is that it stores the
loaded programs at the header address + 1000H in order to avoid overlapping monitor
workspace and stack (this assumes some memory expansion, of course).
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the displacement of 1000H makes it easier to modify the absolute
jumps, etc. that are necessary after re-location.
</p>
<p>
To use the load program, execute at 0C80, then load from cassette. The VDU
format and error-checking are as under <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span>.
