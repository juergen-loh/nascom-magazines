was added in place of the HALT. When executed, the screen filled with &lsquo;snow&rsquo; (it was a
Nascom&nbsp;1 remember), but my asterisk seemed to be flashing on and off like the
clappers. So fast in fact, that what I saw was the thing beating with the TV line
scan. Second evening gone but flushed with success, I thought I had it licked. All I
had to do was add a delay after loading an asterisk to screen and again after loading
the space. The only problem was that there wasn&rsquo;t an instruction that said &ldquo;DELAY 1
SECOND&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Now what? How do you make the thing hang about for a second before it goes
onto the next stage. Well the idea of a delay subroutine occurred to me. The only
problem was how to write one. Make it sit there and count to itself seemed a good
idea, but how? Now I had read that the HL register pair could do 16 bit arithmetic.
How about making it count to 65000 odd (from 0000 to FFFF), by using the INC HL
instruction. That should slow it up a bit. Then another problem came to mind. I could
see asterisks on the screen, but how was I to know whether the thing was counting. I&rsquo;d
read about the &lsquo;S&rsquo; single step instruction, but didn&rsquo;t know what it did. Perhaps I
could use this somehow to see what was going on. Ok, test it. I wrote

using the &lsquo;M&rsquo; command, and then typed S 0D00. Well it displayed something

Yes, well, what did that all mean. Read the book. 1000, that must be the contents of
the SP register (why 1000 I wonder), 0D03 that&rsquo;s the program counter, that figures,
it&rsquo;s pointing to the next instruction. 4800 that must be the AF register pair, and
look the HL register pair has 0000 in it. Now if I take one more step&nbsp;....

Cor, look at that, HL was incremented by one, just as I had instructed. The only thing
now was to make it do that again and again until it had reached FFFFH.
</p>
<p>
It was about then that I decided that remembering the order of the &lsquo;S&rsquo; command
register display was a bit of a pain. So I stuck a bit of masking tape (left over from
respraying the dent the Mrs put in the car) across the top of the monitor screen and
wrote on it

so that as the display scrolled up the screen, I could see what was happening.
</p>
<p>
Well, what happens when it gets to FFFFH? It overflows, and goes back to
0000H. Read the book. It says an arithmetic overflow sets the Carry flag. Good. But,
by implication, does a non-overflow unset the Carry flag? The book doesn&rsquo;t say, so try
it. If I load HL with FFFFH, then increment it twice, the first time should set the
Carry, and the second time unset it. Away we go

Odd that!!! Something should have happened to the AF register, but it didn&rsquo;t change.
Back to the drawing board. As an experiment I tried it with the A register and the
same thing didn&rsquo;t happen. Or at least the F register changed, but when I set to and
decoded the HEX number in the F register into its component bits (see part 1), and
then compared it with the little map of bits in the F register in the book, the Z
(zero) flag and the P/V (parity) flags had been set. (Now you may be wondering why I
had to decode the F register bits, as NAS-SYS obligingly prints out the registers set
at the end of the &lsquo;S&rsquo; command display. Remember this was an original Mk I Nascom&nbsp;1,
with NASBUG T1, it didn&rsquo;t have such luxuries.) Anyway, it figures, The A register had
gone to zero, but what happened to my &lsquo;carry&rsquo;? Well as the Z flag had an effect, try
