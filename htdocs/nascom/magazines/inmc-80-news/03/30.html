since sectors start at 01H rather than 00H, it is slightly less than 32K. This problem
can be solved by putting data onto disk (or reading it off) in blocks: not exceeding
30K in length. The whole usable RAM under NAS-SYS/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Disk can be tranferred in 2 x 28K
blocks, and the whole lot can be read or written in less that 30 seconds.

Ego Departmart

<p>
It has come to the attention of your intrepid reporter that the Great British
Post Office (sorry, shouldn&rsquo;t that be British Telecom?) indulges in a little bit of
flag waving now and then. It seems that when they have custom made chips manufactured,
they have a little picture of Buzby printed on the masks. Further, it&rsquo;s rumoured that
they use Buzby&rsquo;s legs as a registartion target. I always thought there were more uses
for that dratted bird than the adverts proclaimed.

Whilst on the subject of ego boosting, Nascom, under the guise of the Reciever
have been flinging High Court injunctions about. One of the affidavits actually quotes
part of this very column (from the
<a href="../../../02/45/text/#article1">last issue</a>)
as evidence (of what I can&rsquo;t figure
out)&hellip; but still, it&rsquo;s flattering to mentioned in high places.
</p>
<p>
Another titbit from the court evidence seems that Nascom want to stop people
using the prefix &lsquo;NAS&rsquo; on various non-Nascom products. I wonder how they are going to
stop the space shuttle carrying the legend &ldquo;NASA&rdquo; on the sides&nbsp;?

&ldquo;If a Fortran program is to be run in ROM, the programmer must be aware of the
ramifications.&rdquo; UGH&nbsp;!!!
