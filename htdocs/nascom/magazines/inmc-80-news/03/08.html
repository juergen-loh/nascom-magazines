<u>CRT Speed Error</u>
</h3>
<p>
For those readers who have not been able to get my CRT display speed control working (see
<a href="../../../02/04/text/#article1">last issue</a>),
please curse no more, there is a misprint or two.
Corrections as follows: In BASIC line 20, the third data item should be 3187 NOT
31187. Also, under &ldquo;To EXECUTE FROM NAS-SYS:&rdquo; &lsquo;TABLE Address&rsquo; should be 077E NOT 0C7E.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise all is in order and I expect most have solved the difficulties
anyway (!)
</p>
<p>
No hard feelings,
</p>

<a href="../../../02/01/text/#page">Issue&nbsp;2</a> was excellent. Can this go on?

<u>More Thanks</u>
</h3>
<p>
This is a letter of thanks for your efforts over the past year.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, the INMC80 News is indispensible to a Nascom owner. As it seems
to be almost impossible to get any technical information from Nascom, INMC80 is the
only source left to us.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to my membership of INMC80 last year I now have a Nascom&nbsp;2 which runs
at 4MHz without wait states and will also run cassette in/out at 2400&nbsp;baud with no
errors! I also have made use of the INKEY, REPEAT and &lsquo;PRINT USING&rsquo; routines and have
several very interesting M/C code program on tape.
</p>
<p>
All the above I would never of heard of without INMC80s: once again &ndash; many
thanks and long may you prosper! How do you do it for the price?
</p>
<p>
One last point &ndash; I have just finished entering the Space Invaders prog. in
<a href="../../../02/57/text/#article1">INMC80-2</a>
and whilst I find it very good indeed I do not like the use of the &lsquo;A&rsquo; and
&lsquo;X&rsquo; Keys for Base Movement &ndash; also it runs too fast for me even at Novice level!
Please, can you publish in the next mag. details of how to: (1) slow it down, and (2)
change the left and right movement keys as, in spite of David Hunt&rsquo;s excellent
articles on Z80 Assembler programming I doubt if I shall ever understand enough to
attempt such alterations on my own

Ed &ndash; I&rsquo;m sorry, but we don&rsquo;t have a source listing of the Space Invaders, so cannot
advise on any mods &ndash; anybody disassembled it yet and can answer?
