Dear INMC
</p>
<p>
I recently completed a new IO extension board for my NASCOM&nbsp;1,
this included a CUTS cassette interface, a sound effects generator chip
and some TTL ports for a joystick, keyboard and an IBM printer (my PIO
is used to provide real time interupts from the video blanking logic).
On testing the board by reading and writing to the new ports I got
conflicts with more than one device attempting to put data on the bus
at the same time. Naturally I suspected that I had either designed or
wired up the port decoding wrongly, but I could find no errors on my
board.
</p>
<p>
I decided to look at the NASCOM&nbsp;1 circuit again to check that I
was providing the correct IOEXT signal, and here I discovered the cause
of the problem, below is a simplified version of the NASCOM&nbsp;1 IO
decoding:
</p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-14-1.png"); ?>
<p>
As can be seen on internal port decoding, if A2 is lo then the keyboard
and UART ports are selected while A2 hi selects the PIO. Unfortunatly
on external IO decoding IOEXT has the same effect as A2 had, so that
there is no way of turning off the NASCOM&nbsp;1 ports. Fortunatly the
circuit can be corrected with the existing gates, to the following:
