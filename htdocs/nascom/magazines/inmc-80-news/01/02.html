&lsquo;HE&rsquo; speaks

<h2>
CHAIRMAN&rsquo;S BIT
</h2>
<p>
Not so long ago you will have received a letter from us stating
that Nascom had called for a Receiver to handle its affairs. At the
same time the letter said we&rsquo;d all resigned. Implication: we were all
off to the Bahamas with the INMC funds. Well: sorry, but it&rsquo;s not true,
we are back again, and to prove it, with a bumper issue containing
about 10 pages more than usual.
</p>
<p>
In the past we have relied on Nascom for secretarial support,
which has been withdrawn on the arrival of the new &lsquo;Powers That Be&rsquo;
over at Chesham. However, a friendly Nascom distributor has agreed (at
least temporarily) to give us a home, help us keep the paperwork
straight and deal with programs, subscriptions and distribution. We
won&rsquo;t advertise here (it won&rsquo;t take you long to find out who he is),
but Ta folks.
</p>
<p>
Now to the INMC itself, we&rsquo;ve got to change the name, to get
round any legal nasties and break entirely with Nascom, so if you
haven&rsquo;t noticed already, this newsletter is called INMC80 issue 1. You
know and I know its INMC 8, but that&rsquo;s the way it goes. The &lsquo;80&rsquo; stands
for 1980, or Z80, or the square root of the number of members, or
something. Cheques payable to INMC80 in future please. Secondly, we
must register ourselves as a charity or a &lsquo;Ltd&rsquo; company pretty shortly,
so we can get the benefit of VAT refunds etc., we haven&rsquo;t decided which
yet, but if anyone has any vigorous objections to one or the other, or
can offer advice, let us know.
</p>
<p>
As we mentioned last newsletter, funds aren&rsquo;t quite what they
could be. The cost of newsletter printing and distribution costs rather
more than the annual subscriptions. Hint&nbsp;!!! We had hoped to make up
this deficit with advertising. Where are you&nbsp;??? Only two this time,
and we need five pages worth to keep the books in balance. If you are
passing your friendly distributor, wave your copy of this newsletter
under his nose and tell him we need his custom (and you&rsquo;d naturally buy
it if you saw in OUR pages). In the meantime, our friendly distributor
has agreed to stand any liability we may incur for 12 months, or until
the funds allow us to be totally self supporting (which ever is the
sooner).
</p>
<p>
There has been some re-organisation of the committee; there
will be an honorary executive committee consisting of Chairman,
Secretary/Editor and Treasurer; and an&rsquo; editorial committee. All the
existing loonies have agreed to continue to stand in their original
capacities, we will aquire a Nascom representative (for the inside
information), and we need a Dodo. If you are wondering what a Dodo is,
well if you don&rsquo;t follow every piece of golden prose to be found on
these hallowed pages, then it could be you. No offence intended, but
the committee needs someone who has little practical understanding of
Nascoms and who can argue with the rest of the editorial committee. His
job will be to stop us all making this newsletter only readable by the
elite.

One Dodo required. Nascom owner essential (fitted with CUTS interface),
