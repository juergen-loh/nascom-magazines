low order byte is stored first.)</td></tr>

A LLLL TTTT<br>

symbol table area. Put this value at 2002&nbsp;&ndash; 2003.</td></tr>

A LLLL E4F5<br>

It has come to our notice that there is a potential fault on
the Nascom 8&nbsp;amp PSU. For some reason the &lsquo;0&nbsp;volt&rsquo; rail is not
connected to mains earth, which means that the chassis is &lsquo;floating&rsquo;.
Now this is alright until the nurk assembling the power transistors on
the PSU heatsink leaves out the insulating washers. Connect it all up,
and the chassis floats at about 12&nbsp;volts. Earth the chassis, and
bang&nbsp;!!!! Nascom say this has now been put right. But you have been
warned.
