<tr><td>1.</td><td>Make a note of the number displayed on the top right of the
screen, when the file is loaded under ZEAP 1.1. Call this
value TTTT.</td></tr>

I 1B0D 2002 8000</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>Examine the address at 2002 &ndash; 2003. Call this LLLL. (Remember
low order byte is stored first.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td><td>Calculate TTTT &ndash; LLLL by entering:<br>
A LLLL TTTT<br>
and looking at the second value displayed. This gives the
symbol table area. Put this value at 2002 &ndash; 2003.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td><td>Calculate LLLL + E4F5 by entering:<br>
A LLLL E4F5<br>
and looking at the first value displayed. This gives the file
length. Put this value at 2000 &ndash; 2001.</td></tr>

E 1000 8000 2000<br>

It has come to our notice that there is a potential fault on
the Nascom 8 amp PSU. For some reason the &lsquo;0 volt&rsquo; rail is not
connected to mains earth, which means that the chassis is &lsquo;floating&rsquo;.
Now this is alright until the nurk assembling the power transistors on
the PSU heatsink leaves out the insulating washers. Connect it all up,
and the chassis floats at about 12 volts. Earth the chassis, and
bang&nbsp;!!!! Nascom say this has now been put right. But you have been
warned.
