Checksum Routines
</h1>
<p>
The following assembler programs submitted by David Wadham are
to enable 16 bit checksums to be accumulated for any length program.
This is a useful feature and we may well use it in future for published
programs, allowing members to verify that programs have been typed in
correctly. Also note the economy of the listing when written for
Nas-Sys using Nas-sys internal routines.
