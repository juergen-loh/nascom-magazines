Mr. J. Addey has sent us a useful subroutine which prints HL in
decimal. We have modified it for Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nas-Sys, and have also saved
quite a few bytes by tidying it up and converting to full use of the
Z80. Here it is complete with a little program which demonstrates the
use of several Nas-Sys routines. Run the program at 0D00H and type in a
value in HEXadecimal. Errors are trapped. This program is a good
starting point for beginners to analyse.
