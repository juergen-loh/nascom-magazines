On Basic I found the following to be of use :
</p>
<p>
Illustrating Basic, Alcock: C.U.P. (Paperback recommended).
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Basic, Ken Knecht&nbsp;: Dilitium. On general theory, but
exceedingly expensive &ndash; you have been warned.
</p>
<p>
Compiler Construction For Digital Computers, D. Gries, J. Wiley.
(8.00-10.00 in paperback) probably the bible, but also probably
slightly dated&ndash;? Not for beginners.
</p>
<p>
Writing Interactive Interpreters and Compilers, P. Brown: J. Wiley.
(8.00). A book which is fun to read, and makes you feel that you could
write your own compiler. Emphasis very much on Basic.
</p>
<p>
Understanding and Writing Compilers, R. Bornat: Macmillan. (6.00)
Paperback. Much heavier than Brown, but with more meat and also more
oriented to Pascal/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Algol type languages. Not for the beginner.
</p>
<p>
Structured System Programming, Welsh &amp; McKeag: Prentice Hall. (14.00)
Interesting in that it presents a Mini Pascal Compiler written in
Pascal, and shows the importance of structure in writing clear
programs.
</p>
<p>
System Programming, Donovan: McGraw Hill. (6.50). A useful book which
looks at the theory and implementation of Assemblers, Compilers,
Interpreters and Operating Systems. Although using IBM assembly
language, it is quite clear, and forms a good introduction to these
subjects.
</p>
<p>
On the subject of programming with style &ndash; has anyone looked inside the
Nascom Basic&nbsp;? It&rsquo;s only a 8080 basic, with input output patches all
over it. It provokes the throught of how much faster/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>more compact it
would be if it were written in Z80 code from the ground up. Benchmarks
on the Xtal Basic and Nascom Basic might be interesting to compare.
