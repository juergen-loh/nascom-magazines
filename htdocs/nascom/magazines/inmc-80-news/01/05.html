Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
For some time, rumours have been circulating about the appalling
conditions in which some Nascoms are expected to work. There have even
been some stories of them being EX-PORTED. How would you like your ears
cut off, I ask you&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully,

<u class="double">BASIC PROGRAM</u>

<p>
Dear Sirs,
</p>
<p>
Please find enclosed a bit of a program that I find fairly useful for
games and graph joining etc. It is for Nascom graphics and joins
together any two points on the screen. It does NOT test for off screen
positions.
</p>
<p>
I have found that it can speed up quite a lot of programs which draw
graphs or circles etc using scientific functions with larger spacings
than for continuous graphics, because the number of points available
and the definition of Nas graphics is fairly low anyway.
</p>
<p>
The second point is a bit of a moan about the Microsoft Basic, which,
as far as I can tell, is only valid on the Nascom implementation. This
is when listing reserved words (graphic characters) within quotes on a
print line and those after a REM statement are printed as their command
equivalents, making it impossible to edit them. I have had to write a
machine language routine to let me enter them and edit them then
dumping to tape to be read in as lines in a program. Not to worry
version 123.4 will no doubt cure it.
</p>
<p>
All the same a magic beastie, now after a floppy from California.
</p>
<p>
Cheers,
</p>
