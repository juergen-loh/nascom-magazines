The Nascom I/O board was just too late for the last issue, so
this review was held over. The I/O board accomodates 3 PIOs, 1 UART and
1 CTC. The PIOs are the MK3881 type as fitted to the Nascom main board,
the UART is likewise similar, but has a crystal controlled BAUD rate
generator giving speeds from 110 to 9600&nbsp;BAUD, transmit and receive can
only take place at the same speed, unlike the separate transmit/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>receive
arrangement on the Nascom&nbsp;2. The final chip is the MK3882 &ldquo;Counter
Timer Circuit&rdquo;, an ingeniously simple chip, more details later. The
board is supplied with sockets for all the chips, but only the
necessary chips to put the board into action come with the kit. The
major I/O devices, their attendant decoders, plugs, leads (and in the
case of the UART, the BAUD rate generator, crystal and sundry Rs and
Cs) are supplied as &lsquo;add-on&rsquo; packs, to be purchased as required. The
kit is supplied with documentation and the PIO, UART and CTC technical
manuals. The three PIOs talk to the outside world through three 26 way
connectors (a la Nascom&nbsp;2) on the front edge of the pcb. The UART has
RS232 and 20mA input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output via a 16 pin dil socket. The CTC
input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output and the BAUD rate select are also via 16 pin dil sockets.
If I remember correctly, the original published spec. of the I/O board
included a modem as well. This seems to have fallen by the wayside.

The Issue&nbsp;2 boards supplied have a track error which we
understand was not spotted until a quantity of pcs had been made, and
an errata is included giving the small amount of &lsquo;board surgery&rsquo;
required. This &lsquo;surgery&rsquo; is only required when the UART is brought into
play. The errata also covers other small documentation errors, but has
not spotted that PIO 1 and PIO 3 are reversed throughout. The
documentation rates the &lsquo;INMC FOUR STAR AWARD&rsquo; for incomprehensibility,
understanding was not helped by the fact that a number of kits escaped
with the last three pages of the documentation missing. The circuit
diagram however was clear and detailed, and once one realises that the
8131 decoders used are only glorified XOR gates (or comparators), then,
what the documentation lacks, the circuit diagram makes up for.

Construction was straight forward and simple, the pcb being of
the usual high standard, however, the style of pcb layout was entirely
different to the usual style of Nascom pcbs, which made following
things through a little more difficult than usual. Nothing wrong here,
just different. We understand the pcb was laid out by hand rather than
Nascoms&rsquo; usual practice of using a drafting computer. The manual gave
details of recommended I/O mapping, although perhaps this was
uninspired, and not helped by the missing appendix which we presume
gave an expanded I/O map. Connecting the decode links was carried out
from the drawings in the manual, no explanation was offered as to why
things should be linked in the fashion shown. Watch out for the fact
that the Nascom internal port decode (IOEXT line) can be set to either
ports 0 &ndash; 4 or 0 &ndash; 8. When used with Nascom&nbsp;1 the onboard PIO has to be
removed, meaning that the lowest decode address may be 4, whereas the
PIO in the Nascom&nbsp;2 can remain in situe, if so, then the lowest decode
address should be set to 2. After a visual check, the board was tried.

Then a hidden bug appeared. We&rsquo;ve
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/06/21/text/#article3">mentioned before</a>
that the IEI
and IEO tines get connected together on a Nascom&nbsp;2 if you use the
little mini-bus that was supplied with the 16K versions or a &lsquo;Vero
bus&rsquo;, and this means that the &lsquo;daisy chain&rsquo; interrupt priority function
is &lsquo;all screwed up!&rsquo;. Not a serious problem, but requires thought to
