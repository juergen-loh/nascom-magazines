The program to drive the game replaces the code using the keyboard
exactly, apart from the delay routine which follows the end of the
original coding.
</p>
<p>
The program executes from D00H, starting with PIO initialisation and
then jumping to the original program.

In principle, the ideas given above can be adapted to suit many games.
The unit makes Space Invasion much easier to play and saves wear and
tear on the keyboard when hitting the keys in the excitment of the
game.
