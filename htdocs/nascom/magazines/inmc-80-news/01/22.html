Below are extracts from several letters that we received in response to
our article in <a href="../../../../inmc-news/06/11/text/#article1">INMC 6</a> on Comp S100 expansion.

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Firstly thanks for a newsy and (usually) accurate comic which is always
worth reading.
</p>
<p>
With regard to the article is Issue 6, caution should be exercised when
buying the COMP S100 expansion kit. We looked into using this product
to drive a (U.S.) Heuristics Speechlab Board and found that instead of
being a true S100 decoder, ONLY these signals required for use with the
range of boards COMP sell are actually decoded.
</p>
<p>
Hope the comments are of some use.
Yours faithfully,
</p>

Dear Sir,
In INMC News no. 6, I was pleased to see that someone else was
experiencing problems with the Comp S100 expansion. Mine has never
worked, I started off with symptoms similar to those described by Mr.
Curtis, but all this was cured by rearranging the wiring. My Nascom
works perfectly, on external, with the buffer S100 board attached, I
can write into the 8K expansion, but when I try to execute any program
in the expansion, the program is corrupted. Any program in the on board
Nascom memory runs without problems. Anyway I&rsquo;m now going to look at
the R/W lines. Comp assured me that they&rsquo;ve had no problems with this
kit at all. At the moment I am working on connecting up an MM57109
Number Cruncher. I will let you know how I get on.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully,
</p>
