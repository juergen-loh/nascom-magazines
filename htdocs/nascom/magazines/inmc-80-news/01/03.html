Articles wanted
</h4>
<p>
To keep this newsletter going we need articles, preferably readable and
understandable, on any Nascom related subject. You&rsquo;ll notice from this
issue that we have had another couple of volunteers, but we need more.
The more you put into this thing, the more you will get out of it.
</p>
<p>
So to sum up, the news is; the INMC still exists, and we intend
(with your help) to make the Newsletters bigger, better and more
informative. But we need more help from distributors (advertising),
committee (one Dodo), and everyone else (articles/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>reviews/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>comments).

The story so far. Nascom started from humble beginnings in
November 1977, as an offshoot of a semiconductor distributor, Nasco
Ltd. They did well, too well. Expansion requires money for development
and marketing, and money comes from banks and places like that. You try
walking into a bank (any bank) and try to get a loan without either
previous credit history, or on the promise that what you intend to do
with the money will make the bank&rsquo;s fortune. When you pick yourself up
off the door step, consider Nascom&rsquo;s problem.
</p>
<p>
Nascom&nbsp;2 was an expensive exercise, financed by Nascom, but
money to get it into production was provided by the &lsquo;city&rsquo;. Nascom&rsquo;s
return on Nascom&nbsp;2 was immediately frustrated by component supply
difficulties and instead of making a healthy profit the &lsquo;give away 16K
RAM&rsquo; exercise was born. Their expansion came to an abrupt stop when the
&lsquo;city financial institution&rsquo; decided it was not prepared to continue to
allow Nascom sufficient working capital to continue. Nascom were
presented with no choice but to call in a Receiver. See
<?php externalLink("Personal Computer World, July 1980, page 42","Guy Kewney&rsquo;s article"); ?>
on page&nbsp;42 of July 80 edition of PCW.
</p>
<p>
What now&nbsp;? The Receiver is keeping Nascom going until such time
as a buyer is found. He is even getting the Floppy Disk Controller, the
Programmable Character Generator and the Colour Board into production.
We understand that there are a number of potential purchasers in the
offing. The future of Nascom is very much at the mercy of whoever
ultimately buys it, but some predictions can be made. Any purchaser is
unlikely to &lsquo;asset strip&rsquo; as Nascom has few tangible assets to strip,
therefore anyone buying it can only do so with the intention of keeping
it going. However, the purchaser is not committed to produce&rsquo; those
Nascom items still waiting to see the light of day. For instance, the
&lsquo;System 80&rsquo; box may be restyled and further delayed.
</p>
<p>
In any event, it seems that Nascom will continue in some form
or other, and whilst the product exists we will do our best to support
it.
