I have been using Zen for over a year (as well as Zeap), and have
patched Zen to run on Nas-Sys. It is a very fast assembler with one
drawback &ndash; a lousy error handling function&nbsp;! It aborts assembly on the
first error it finds. In &ldquo;Writing Interactive Interpreters and
Compiliers&rdquo;, P.J. Brown points out that a compiler spends most of its
time in the error handling mode, and should be designed to do this well
&ndash; Zen definitely doesn&rsquo;t. I have been tidying it up, and have written a
number of Pseudo ops; TITLE to title a printed page, LIST and UNLIST to
allow selective printout of sections during assembly. RCAL and SCAL to
make life under Nas-Sys easier. I have also taken the DB, DW, DM,
pseudo ops to <?php externalLink("Zilog","",""); ?>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Mostek standards (DEFB etc). My next miracle will
be to tidy up the error handling, so that it will do the first pass,
and point all first pass errors. Then (perhaps) a macro facility&nbsp;?

If you want to halt a program this can be done by including the code 76
in your program. When this HALT instruction is executed, the program
counter stops being incremented and an endless stream of NOPs are
executed. The Z80 CPU detects that it has halted and a LED on the
Nascom lights to show that it is in a HALT state.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to leave a HALT state. The first and most commonly
used is to press Reset, which restarts the computer and reinitialises
Nas-Sys.
</p>
<p>
The second method is for there to be ar interrupt. In fact, if you were
writing a program which was to do nothing at all except when an
interrupt occurred, you could just code a HALT instruction. Note that
if you intended the Z80 to re-enter the HALT state after the completion
of the interrupt, then the code would be as follows:<br>
76 18 FD<br>
as the address of the HALT (pushed on the stack) at the start of the
interrupt, is POPed off and incremented when a RETI instruction is
encountered.
</p>
<p>
This explains why you can Single-step through HALT instructions. The
HALT is executed once, but the NMI (Non Maskable Interrupt) generated
by Single-stepping jumps out of the HALT state at the end of the
instruction.
</p>
<p>
If you try to execute a program which has a HALT instruction as the
first byte, you will find that it will not HALT. The reason is that the
Execute command in fact Single-steps the first instruction and then
executes normally. So if the program was:
</p>
<p class="indent">
76 .. .. .. it would not HALT
</p>
<p>
But if it was:
</p>
<p class="indent">
00 76 .. .. it would HALT.
