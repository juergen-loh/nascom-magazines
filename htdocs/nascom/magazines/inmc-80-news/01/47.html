<u class="double">NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 &ndash; IMPROVED VERSION OF NAS-SYS&nbsp;1</u>
</h2>
<p>
1. All the keys on the keyboard automatically repeat when held
down, (Not the @ key.) The initial repeat delay and the repeat
speed are adjustable.
</p>
<p>
2. All routines are interruptable, so that interrupt can be used
while executing NAS-SYS routines.
</p>
<p>
3. The CRT routine allows data to be output anywhere in memory,
so headings can be output to the top line of the display.
</p>
<p>
4. The Read command has an optional parameter which allows cassette
tapes to be read into any memory locations.
</p>
<p>
5. The Tabulate command is enhanced in three ways. Firstly, ASCII
values of the bytes are output as well as the usual hexadecimal
tabulation. Secondly, a fourth parameter can be used to specify the
output of additional values on each line, to allow for printers of
different widths. Thirdly, a fifth parameter allows suppression of
either the hexadecimal output or the ASCII output.
</p>
<p>
6. All NAS&nbsp;-SYS routines can be single stepped, which makes it
easier to test a program which uses NAS-SYS routines. By using the
repeat keyboard feature, high speed single stepping is possible.
</p>
<p>
7. The register display is enhanced so that it shows the two byte
value pointed to by each of the main registers.
</p>
<p>
8. Output from the Modify command is displaced two characters to the
right, to improve readability.
</p>
<p>
9. The External (X) command has additional options, and no longer
fails to output nulls. This enables the NULL command in BASIC to
work correctly.
</p>
<p>
10. There are three new commands. P displays the stored user
program registers. D executes a program at D000H and Y executes a
program at B000H.
</p>
<p>
11. The cursor blink rate is adjustable.
</p>
<p>
12. There are three new routines. Repeat keyboard scan, Output
two spaces, and a new routine which can execute any other routine.
</p>
<p>
13. Both on breakpoint and on NMI, control passes through the $NMI
jump before displaying the registers, allowing a program to take
alternative action.
</p>
<p>
14. The B 0 command turns off the breakpoint completely, so that
with appropriate hardware NAS-SYS can be executed in RAM.
</p>
<p>
15. Support in NAS-SYS itself for the use of paper tape has been
removed, so there is no longer a Load command and the Tabulate
command does not output a checksum.
