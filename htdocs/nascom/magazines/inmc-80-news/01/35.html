Dr. L.C. Waring of Holywood, Co. Down sent me a tape of his &ldquo;Tomcat&rdquo;
Editor Assembler which uses the TDL mnemonics &ndash; and he has versions for
early monitors and Nas-Sys. So far, I&rsquo;ve only had a single try at
making it work. With my usual skill, I managed to produce all possible
error messages in no time at all. If the same thing happens next time I
try to use it, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to read the instructions! It is
hardly necessary to add that I suggested he submit it for inclusion in
the program library.

Other people have written interesting letters, and I hope they aren&rsquo;t
offended by not being mentioned. Now for some of my own work.

<span class="uppercase">Sorting It Out</span>.
</h4>
<p>
There are many ways of sorting data into order, the fastest I have seen
is the &ldquo;Quicksort&rdquo;. The version below is adapted from a demonstration
for the Commodore Pet (whatever that is) printed in the Liverpool
Software Gazette (nearly as good as this magazine).

<p>
If you want to sort more than 255 items, the array ST() should be
larger. DIM ST(30,2) will allow you to sort much larger arrays,
whereupon time taken is extended considerably. It remains much faster
than a &ldquo;Bubblesort&rdquo; however. The same program will sort strings, if A()
is changed to A$(), X to X$ and W to W$. At 2MHz it takes about 10
seconds to sort fifty words.
