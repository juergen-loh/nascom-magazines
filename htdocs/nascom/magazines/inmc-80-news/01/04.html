Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
One night, whilst on a recent visit to California, I happened
to be looking for somewhere to sleep. Being particularly hard up, and
it being a fine night, I had a nice comfy packing case in mind. I was
attracted to a pile of boxes full of shredded paper behind a factory
displaying a trade name in the form of a stylized &lsquo;Z&rsquo; picked out in
blue. I must congratulate the owners of the factory on the quality of
their shredded paper, as I spent a very comfortable night, and left the
area the following morning thoroughly refreshed. It wasn&rsquo;t until some
time later that I discovered &lsquo;The Paper&rsquo;. It was a single sheet, that
the shredding machine had somehow missed, which must have worked its
way into my pocket as I slept.&rsquo; Being a thrifty sort, and paper always
coming in useful, I kept it.
</p>
<p>
On my return to the UK, I (naturally) set to to catch up on my back issues of
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/text/#head">INMC news</a>,
and was intrigued by Dr. Dark&rsquo;s &lsquo;Search for
the Missing Op-code&rsquo;. &lsquo;The paper&rsquo; came to mind, as there was something
basically familiar about it. Of course&nbsp;!!!! It was one half of a page
from a programming manual, the mnemonics were there, but the shredder
had had the op-codes. I offer the following to Dr. Dark, in the hope
that he can discover the op-codes which go with these very useful
instructions:
