FREE! Here is a simple idea to control the speed of the CRT display by using the User
output routine.
</p>
<p>
In Basic my version is as follows:<br>
(The routine starts at 0D00H and is 12 bytes long)
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-05-1.png"); ?>
<p>
LINE 10 contains the routine.<br>
LINE 20 contains the addresses to be changed.
</p>
<p>
To vary display speed, POKE 3330,X where X can be 1 to 255, X=1 is Fast, X#255 is
Very Slow&nbsp;! This can be done at any point in a program.
</p>
<p>
In Machine Code, it looks like this:
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-05-2.png"); ?>
<p>
To <span class="uppercase">Execute From</span> NAS&nbsp;SYS:<br>
Load Routine address into 0C78<br>
Load Table address (0C7E) into 0C73
</p>
<p>
These are the Output Routine Address (UOUT) and Start of &lsquo;table of output routines&rsquo;
(OUT) respectively in the Nas&nbsp;Sys workspace.
</p>
<p>
Here is a routine which will save the trouble of entering these addresses by hand each
time:
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-05-3.png"); ?>
<p>
This can be tacked on to the end of the routine itself (or onto the beginning) and
should be executed before trying to change display speed. To vary speed, load (Routine
address +2) with the value required. Remember, &lsquo;0&rsquo; will give you a very slow display,
but &lsquo;1&rsquo; will give almost normal speed. This is why I have set the initial speed at
&lsquo;1&rsquo;.

Ed. There is now a tape version of the Sargon chess available. It comes complete with
the Sargon book, a graphics EPROM containing a Chess set, and a small piggy-back board
to allow switching between the normal graphics and the chess set. This is produced by
Bits &amp; PCs, costs 35.00 plus VAT, and is available from various Nascom distributors.
