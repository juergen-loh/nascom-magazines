<?php columnStart(1, "noindent"); ?>
<p>
So the program:
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-07-1.png"); ?>
<p>
would draw a line from (10,10) to (80,10).
</p>
<p>
Using this method an array of coordinates could be plotted within a short loop. As an
example the following program is suggested:
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-07-2.png"); ?>
<p>
For a clearer picture try GOSUB 65508 instead in line 30. I hope this mod. will be of
some use.

Dear Sirs,
</p>
<p>
Firstly, let me point out yet another sinful error in the GREAT &ldquo;<span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span>&rdquo; book of
WISDOM. Nowhere is there mention of the &lsquo;MO&rsquo; error (<span class="uppercase">Missing Operator</span>) (There is in my
manual, as &lsquo;<span class="uppercase">Missing Operand</span>&rsquo;&nbsp;&ndash; Ed.) which occurs when an argument is missing from an
equation. Incidentally a list of error codes can be found inside the Basic Rom at
locations E2B9 through E2DD.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, here is a program which will generate all the instructions and statements in
the Basic language and place them on the line number equal to the instructions
reserved character value.
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-07-3.png"); ?>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
