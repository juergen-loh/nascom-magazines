I am prepared to offer the services of interface as a co-ordinating body and mailing
address and I would very much like to know if any of the members of your club have had
any involvement with, or would be prepared to become involved in a project or projects
relating to this extremely important field.
</p>
<p>
My understanding of the situation concerning direct or indirect government support is
that there is virtually nothing, and it is obviously going to require the pooling of
resources of both private commercial organisations, private individuals, private
charitable organisations, and research development capabilities which lie within the
various places of advanced studies and teaching.
</p>
<p>
I have also been in touch with Peter Deacon who indirectly is liked with the Spastics
Society and I would like to arrange a meeting of interested parties to discuss the
matter further.
</p>
<p>
If you would be kind enough to publish this letter I know it would reach nearly two
and a half thousand active Nascom users, some of whom may be prepared to assist in
this project.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely,<br>
J.A.Marshali,<br>

<h2>
<u class="double"><span class="uppercase">Pascal</span> Special Interest Group</u>
</h2>
<p>
Object of the INMC80 special interest group is to bootstrap a subset of
Pascal to run on Nascom. Bootstrapping is the process whereby a very small subset of
a language is implemented, and used to compile itself. This small compiler is then
used to compile expanded versions of the subset until a satisfactory result is
achieved.
</p>
<p>
Because of the amount of work in implementing a language, as much use as
possible should be made of existing work. The Byte Tiny Pascal in Basic (1) or <?php externalLink("8080"); ?>
machine code (2) forms a good starting point, as the source is readily available,
and an implementation for Nascom is under way (3) or commercially available (4).
This program compiles the Pascal source into a series of subroutine calls to runtime
support routines.
</p>
<p>
As a working aim, the intention is to implement a Pascal compiler for Nascom
running under NAS-SYS, with floating point arithmetic to at least the accuracy of 8K
BASIC (5), but possibly better, supporting the subset of Pascal implemented in the
Byte Tiny Pascal, extended to include the Pascal &lsquo;type&rsquo; constructs. The object
machine is a 32K Nascom, with ideally runtime support in Eprom, and tape I/O for
storage. For efficiency, the runtime routines will be written in machine code, and
treated as system calls by the compiler. The program when finally completed will be
inserted in the INMC80 program library, as will all the major intermediate steps.
