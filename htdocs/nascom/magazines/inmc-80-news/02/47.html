It is claimed that this assembler runs at 1000 lines per minute on a
2MHz system, which is quite fast (comparative figures being, for ZEAP on my N1
about 400 lines per minute, and ZEN about 1150 lines per minute). Unfortunately
it takes up 9K of memory, compared with ZEAP&rsquo;s 2.8K and ZEN&rsquo;s 3.5K.

In the body of the book, Mr. Weller writes with great sense, and with
some humour on his subject. Unfortunately, I find it difficult to read because
of the necessity to translate from one mnemonic system to another, but he has
some good ideas, and is definitely worth reading if you can manage to do so
without the expense of buying the book. His monitor listing is interesting, as
it (and the assembler) are fully commented, but it does not offer any sizeable
advantages over the T2 bug (remember that one&nbsp;?).

<p>
In my view, a book to be inspected before you purchase &ndash; and don&rsquo;t fail
for the bait of the free assembler &ndash; for the 20.00, you could buy a copy of ZEN
from Newbear, and have enough left over to buy at least one good book on the
Z80.

<u>Z80 and 8080 Assembly Language Programming</u>
</h2>

The name Spracklen is best known as that of the authors of Sargon the
famous chess program for Z80 computers. This paperback book is written by Kathe
Spracklen, and sets out to be an introduction to programming the Z80 in
assembly language for absolute beginners. It is clearly written, showing the
logical development of a program, with the emphasis on keeping proper
documentation and notes. It would serve as an excellent introduction to machine
language. Not only does it use the Z80 <?php externalLink("Zilog"); ?> mnemonics, but it also illustrates
every point in <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> extended (TDL dialect). Those who wish to implement Sargon
on their Nascom will find this most useful for assistance in translating the
mnemonics from the TDL dialect in which Sargon is written to the Z80 mnemonics
most of use are used to.

<p>
It has a number of exercises, and is fully provided with answers, so
that you can check your work if you wish.
