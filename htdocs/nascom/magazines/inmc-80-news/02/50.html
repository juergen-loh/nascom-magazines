A useful extra, saves a wasted <?php externalLink("2708"); ?> or lots of typing. Works. From Basic, one Poke on,
one Poke off.

Supposed to scan the keyboard once and return with value if key pressed. I can&rsquo;t get

Activate U out, X out, Return to monitor respectively. Since I don&rsquo;t understand

<h3>
<u>Irritating Features.</u>
</h3>
<p>
The Henry&rsquo;s format of &ldquo;.&lt;Command&gt;&rdquo; is a nuisance compared to the meaningful names of
the other. Soon get used to it though. The Bits and P.C.&rsquo;s has some strange features
(not really bugs but with no info....)
</p>
<p>
<span class="uppercase">Documentation</span> of both is of the standard that we have come to expect, i.e. lousy.
There seems small chance of gaining any comprehension of how either works, though the
Henry&rsquo;s information is slightly better.
</p>
<p>
<span class="uppercase">Relative Advantages</span> &hellip;I generally use the Bits and P.C.s toolkit since it is 1) in
ROM and instantly available 2) uses no RAM space at all except in the work area. The
Henry&rsquo;s version eats 2K of expensive RAM. However, the price paid for this is that the
Bits and P.C.s toolkit is very noticeably slower.<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Fair exchange&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
<span class="uppercase">Are They Worth Buying</span>&nbsp;? Well, I don&rsquo;t regret the money and wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose
either. However I would trade both for the following facilities comprehensively
implemented in ROM: 1) Renumber, like the Henry&rsquo;s 2) Find and optionally change 3)
Append 4) Auto 5) Cross reference listing 6) Dump ....in that order, implemented using
Keyboard repeat (&nbsp;or use Nas-sys&nbsp;3) The rest of the facilities are o.k. but Oh! for a
find and optionally change.............

Please note: the author is a known Dodo; bear this in mind when buying either.
