In the
<a href="../../../01/40/text/#article1">last issue of INMC80 News</a>
there is a very interesting article about converting
Zeap&nbsp;1.0 to Nas-Sys operation. I would like to obtain a copy of the patch tape
mentioned in this article, but I cannot find any other reference to DJ Software who
supply it.
</p>
<p>
Please can anyone give me their address?

The last issue
(<a href="../../../01/01/text/#page">INMC&nbsp;80-1</a>)
of the newsletter exceeded all expectations (including the
one that it might not come at all&nbsp;!). Personally, I would not complain if the
subscription was increased, as it represents such good value. &ldquo;Piranha&rdquo; is worth the
annual subscription alone. Come to that, so is the modification to set the Nascom&nbsp;2
cassette interface running at 2400&nbsp;Baud! (Eat your hearts out T**dy, P*t etc.).

Dear INMC80,
</p>
<p>
With reference to
<a href="../../../01/05/text/#article2">INMC&nbsp;80 Iss.1</a>,
may I suggest the following changes to M.Taylor&rsquo;s
plotting routine. In general it is convenient to have the origin on the bottom left
rand corner. Also a MOVE not LINE command may be desired.
</p>
<p>
The following changes are proposed:
</p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-06-1.png"); ?>
<p>
This modification allows the user to move the cursor (or pointer) across the screen
and draw lines from any two points. The following variables are used:
</p>
<p>
A &ndash; X-coordinate (horizontal)<br>
B &ndash; Y-coordinate (vertical)<br>
T &ndash; (=1 Move to coordinate, =2 Line to coordinate)<br>
<span style="padding-left: 2em">&lt;First command must be a move&gt;</span>
</p>
