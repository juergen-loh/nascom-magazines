<h3>
<u class="double">LOCAL CLUBS</u>
</h3>
<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Upon joining the INMC a few months ago, I was taken by how comprehensive and useful
the newsletter is, considering the low budget you must have to work within. I would
however like to see more details of local clubs and club activities made available, if
there are any&nbsp;!
</p>
<p>
Every club depends on the interaction and communication of its members with the H.Q.
With this end in mind if there are no local group meetings being held then why not&nbsp;? I
personally would like very much to meet fellow owners of NASCOM&rsquo;s (perhaps over a pie
and a pint in a local hostelry) so we can lurch out of the door satisfied in the
knowledge that we are members of an elite club who have exchanged ideas (visions&nbsp;?) of
the system expansions to come!
</p>
<p>
With this purpose in mind might I suggest that any willing members or non-members (are
there any) who would like to meet with the aforementioned in mind, please contact me
at the address below so that we can arrange something, sometime, somewhere in the
locality of St. Albans. Looking forward to hearing from someone out there.
</p>
<p>
Bye for now.<br>

<u class="double">HELPING THE HANDICAPPED</u>
</h3>
<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
During recent months I have been made aware of the activities of a number of people
involved with applications for microprocessor based products for the physically
handicapped.
</p>
<p>
In particular I have read with interest an article that appeared in a recent issue of
Computer Age written by Patrick Poon.
</p>
<p>
Although I have left Nascom I would like to see if it is possible to gather together
names of people who would be interested in both the specific project Mr. Poon was
involved in, i.e. children with Cerebral Palsy, and also other aspects where the
microcomputer could possibly aid the disabled.
