consortia like this can do a lot to help Nascom users world wide. We have twisted
their collective arms for an advert which covers many products you may not have
previously heard of, and we hear there is yet more to come.

On the score of collectivity (sounds a nice socialist, this fella), we&rsquo;ve been
thinking that this newsletter is exclusively about Nascoms. Yet when you get to the
end of this &lsquo;Chairman&rsquo;s bit&rsquo;, you will realise that the likelyhood of more Nascom
(Nascom meaning from Nascom) goodies appearing is disappearing as fast as fried
snowballs. Yet other goodies are arriving thick and fast from other sources. We
already have the Winchester Technology colour graphics board and Interface&rsquo;s EPROM
card, both Nasbus compatible. We have heard rumours about a new Nasbus based Z80
computer being planned for the middle of next year (shades of Nascom&nbsp;3), and the
rumours about a mini programmable graphics is certainly more than a myth. Anyway, to
the point. Whilst we think that this newsletter should remain an organ for the
enlightenment of Nascom owners, we also feel that more emphasis should be put on
Nasbus itself. What do you think? The more manufacturers who support Nasbus the
better? Or should Nascom and Nasbus be allowed to sink into oblivion, and simply
remain a name known to a few.

Now to the bad news. (No not that, not yet). Richard Beal, who has been with
the committee from the start has resigned. He seemed reluctant to do so, but as he&rsquo;s
about 16,000 miles away now, keeping in touch is a little difficult. His excuse has
been that his job has taken him to the Solomon Islands (right and up a bit from
Australia), and although he protests that he is working very hard, we can not remove
the picture from our minds of him sitting on some sun scorched sandy beach under a
palm tree sipping coke. Thank you for all your time and help in the past Richard. Just
one thing, when you come back in March, please don&rsquo;t bring back NAS-SYS 4, 5 and 6
with you&nbsp;!!!

Now the really bad news. You may have seen in the press that Nascom had been
rescued by Alteck Technology Initiatives headed by one Peter Mathews. Having met Peter
and his associates I can say that they seem &lsquo;nice people&rsquo;. Peter, an avid Nascom
owner, and Managing Director elect of Nascom voluteered to be our dodo. That killed
several birds with one stone, giving us just the type of dodo we needed, and one that
would listen to the INMC when it came to grass roots requests regarding Nascom
products. Sadly it seems it has all fallen through. I had a phone call from Peter only
a few days ago to tell me the news, as he felt it important that the INMC should be
&lsquo;in the know&rsquo;. I must admit I was flattered by this, and yet saddened by the news. I
don&rsquo;t know why the deal didn&rsquo;t go through, and it would be unjust to speculate. I just
feel sorry for Peter who I think would have made a great success of Nascom.

All this puts the future of Nascom in question again. The receiver is
continuing to manufacture Nascoms and they are being supplied to the dealers. However,
dealer quotas are now falling further and further behind the delivery requirements,
and if I may get a personal &lsquo;gripe&rsquo; in here in the hope that the receiver will read
this; the profit on the quantity of Nascoms supplied last month did not cover the cost
of my company&rsquo;s advertising. We could have sold three times as many Nascoms as were
supplied. If this situation continues much longer, then from a pure economic point of
view, my company can no longer afford to advertise Nascom, and that would be one more
nail in the coffin. I think we are all agreed that Nascoms are very good products at
the right price in the market. Please Mr. Reciever, make more of them to keep it
alive.
