It must be possible to make a colour graphics board that will display more than two
colours at a time in a single character space. And is there any reason why the user
shouldn&rsquo;t have control over the brightness of each pixel&nbsp;? Ideally the resolution
should be as good as that of a colour television, of course. My rough calculations
indicate that it will need about 500K of RAM, and digital to analogue converters
capable of about 25,000,000 operations per second.

Down to earth a bit for the second idea&nbsp;! In the July 1980 issue of Personal Computer
World, R.M.Yorston described how he added a Z80 and 8K of RAM to his 6800-based
system. A board like this, to Nasbus specifications, would really amaze the owners of
lesser computers. To the Nascom, the board would appear to be (say) 4K of RAM. Data
passed into this RAM area could be processed while the Nascom was doing something
else. Several such boards in a system would make possible some really fast processing.
I could run my star ship simulator in real time&nbsp;! Oh, what a givaway...

Here we see that a certain underwear manufacturer, from whom I will never buy a pair
