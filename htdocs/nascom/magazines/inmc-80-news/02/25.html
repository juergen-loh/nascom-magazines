The first two days of the course took us through the simple statements &ndash;
PRINT, INPUT, IF, READ etc., and a discussion of numerical variables and arrays. We
two Nascomites found considerable difficulty in getting used to the rather intolerant
disciplines of the multi-terminal computer after having been used to the screen
editing and other short-cut luxuries of our micros.

<p>
Although the official lecture periods ended at 4.15 p.m. we were often still
typing until dinner at 6.30 when we reluctantly broke off to eat and perhaps join in
an evening activity. This could have been a concert of music, a walk on the downs, a
guided tour of the College or, on the first evening, a sherry party. Generally the
evenings tended to end in the bar, possibly still talking and thinking in Basic and
knowing that if required we could always use the computer until 10.30, usually with
help still available if needed.
</p>
<p>
By mid-week we were into strings and files. Here we had the great advantage
of having access to some of the College files already stored on disks. Thus without
having to type in anything except program instructions we could practice Bubble
Sorts, make new files and investigate search routines.
</p>
<p>
All too quickly the week came to an end. By now we had filed away quite a few
interesting short programs which we were able to print out and take home for further
study. The very first thing we each had had to do on that first Monday morning had
been to write down on paper our individual aim in taking the course. Mine had been
quite simply to learn to think in Basic without worrying about registers, bytes and
memory locations within the machine. At the end I did feel that I had achieved that
aim and had done so in a most enjoyable manner.
</p>
<p>
As to the rest of the family, my wife is as hooked on Avebury and Sarsen
stones and the like as I am on Basic, while the children said their &lsquo;activities&rsquo; were
just, &ldquo;Brill&rdquo;(iant). One thing we all shared at the end was tiredness but at least it
was coupled with a sense of achievment.
