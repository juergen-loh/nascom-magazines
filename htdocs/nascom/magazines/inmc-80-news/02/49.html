<table class="toolkit-compare">
<tr><th>.F&lt;lineno.&gt;&lt;string&gt;</th><th>FIND&lt;string&gt;</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Both very nice and a bit different. .F etc. starts at &lt;lineno.&gt; if specified and
searches for &lt;string&gt; to the end of the text file. If you type for &lt;string&gt; &ldquo;L?&rdquo; for
example, any character will match the &ldquo;?&rdquo;; useful if you use related variable names.
However, it&rsquo;s a bit of a pain for Reserved words, as if you want to find say &ldquo;REM&rdquo; you
have to use the graphics character equivalent. The Bits and P.C.s version has fixed
this and is easier to use. But perhaps someone can explain why I can&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;find
and optionally change&rdquo;? Both of these finds can cause confusion if you forget to turn
them off.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>N/A</th><th>HELP</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Very nice idea but not as good as I&rsquo;d like. (&ldquo;Tough&rdquo;, I hear). After for example&nbsp;, a
&rdquo;? SN Error&rdquo;&nbsp;, if you type &ldquo;HELP&rdquo; the line that caused the problems will be displayed
at the bottom of your screen, with the cursor hopefully near the problem statement.
Unfortunately, the Basic tends to cop out at different places depending on the type of
error, so sometimes it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;HELP&rdquo;. However, if you use multi-statement lines (a
very bad habit) this can indeed be a &ldquo;HELP&rdquo;
</td></tr>
<tr><th>.H&lt;hex value&gt;</th><th>HEX&lt;up to 10 values&gt;</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
These commands accept hex and return decimal. Apparently they are useful for machine
code, whatever that is&nbsp;&ndash; I really wouldn&rsquo;t know. Presumably the bigger the better, so
the Bits and P.C.s gets the &ldquo;*&rdquo; (scared of machine code&nbsp;? Of course not..<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>I&rsquo;m
petrified)
</td></tr>
<tr><th>.K&lt;S&gt;</th><th>N/A</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Again, I find this useful. .KS deletes all non-significant spaces; .K deletes the
&ldquo;REM&rdquo;s as well, so making your programs even more incomprehensible (&nbsp;and much faster).
</td></tr>
<tr><th>.R&lt;nu.start&gt;&lt;inc&gt;&lt;start&gt;&lt;stop&gt;</th><th>RENU&lt;inc&gt;</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Renumber,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>of course: the one really essential facility offered by these add-ons. The
Henry&rsquo;s version is far more versatile, allowing you to start subroutines on reasonable
increments and with care, changing the order of your file!
</td></tr>
<tr><th>N/A</th><th>STEP</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
This is an example of something that is lovely when it works. After typeing &ldquo;STEP&rdquo; you
are asked for a string. You can enter &ldquo;The value of&rdquo;&lt;list of variables&gt; is&ldquo;&lt;list of
variables&gt;. When you type &ldquo;RUN&rdquo; the Basic program is single stepped with the values
defined printed on the top line of the display. Great idea. Unless you have something
else happening on the top line. In which case you can get some extraordinary Syntax
errors. However, if you want to analyse a non- printing subroutine it can be very
useful. But remember to turn it off.

<tr class="toolkit-compare-section"><td colspan=2><u class="uppercase">Utilities</u></td></tr>
<tr><th>N/A</th><th>Inkey</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Not a command, but a routine that is rather trying to call. I prefer the routine
published in INMC as this also gives the flashing cursor.
</td></tr>
<tr><th colspan=2>Keyboard Repeat</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Both toolkits have this facility. The Henry&rsquo;s one tells you how to vary rates.
