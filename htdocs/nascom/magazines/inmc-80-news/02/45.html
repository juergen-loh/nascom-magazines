Reviewers always try to find some criticism to show that they are unbiased,
but in this case, I give up.

With the recent setting up of the West London chapel of the Mafia (migration
from North London perhaps&nbsp;?), it&rsquo;s certainly put the frighteners on one West London
Nascom distributor, who is in the throes of revamping his (not so efficient) mailorder
service to meet this new competition. If the Mafia are true to form, there should be
an interesting undeclared price war breaking out in that area shortly.
</p>
<p>
One London dealer has recently had his knuckles rapped by Nascom for
(unintentionally, he says) &lsquo;ripping off&rsquo; Nascom software. Because of the difficulty of
protecting software in law, I wonder exactly what threat was used&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
Nascoms&rsquo; design team, which was scattered to the winds around the time the
Receiver appeared have got together and started a new company called Specialist Micro
Design. Best of luck lads&nbsp;!! The interesting bit is that ex-Nascom Sales Director and
past INMC President Kerr Borland is on the list of directors. Now Kerr hag recently
formed a promotions company (the name of which I forget, thats good promotion for
you); all that is now required is to throw in ex-Nascom MD John Marshall, and we&rsquo;ve
got Nascom back with the old team. Hmmmm&nbsp;!!!
</p>
<p>
Incedental intelligence recently revealed that the chairman of the Tangerine
Computer Users Group is seriously thinking about buying a Nascom&nbsp;2. Go on lad, then
we&rsquo;ll show you how to write a User&rsquo;s Group magazine as well.
</p>
<p>
A recent issue of Datalink credits Tony Rundle with having designed the Nascom&nbsp;2.
All Nascom owners with Basic know Tony, he&rsquo;s the one who left those bugs in the
Basic, even after he was told about them. Just as well he didn&rsquo;t have anything to do
with the rest of it. If my initials were C.S. or D.R.W., I&rsquo;d be round at my lawyers
right now.
</p>
<p>
I hear that the INMC have had a bit of stick after the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue. One
disgruntled member sent a curt note to the effect that if the INMC is as hard up as
they say they are, why waste space by publishing rubbish like that spoof readers&rsquo;
letter by the chairman, David Hunt (spelt backwards) and silly things like Lawrence.
Well a spokesman for the INMC committee made this point:
</p>
<p class="indent">
They had hoped for 5 pages of ads which did not appear, so as the printers must
have things in blocks of 4 pages, 3 pages were left unused.<br>
Those items were included to fill the extra space, and a bit of light relief
isn&rsquo;t a bad idea, most members appreciate it.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
He also muttered under his breath that he&rsquo;d looked in the writer&rsquo;s envelope about ten
times and still didn&rsquo;t find any article for consideration for the magazine. On that
score, if they decide to stop printing rubbish, they might decide to stop printing my
bit, and that would never do.
