To run this program, first initialise the Basic interpreter with the &lsquo;J&rsquo; command. Then
return to the monitor and execute the above program by typing E D00 NL. This will
generate the program in Basic and return control to the interpreter. Then type &lsquo;LIST&rsquo;
NL and the instructions will be displayed alongside their ASCII (CHR$) values. Note
that the line numbers are in reverse order. Basic uses a list of memory addresses
rather than line numbers to determine which order the information is printed out.

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
If, as you claim, you are short of money then I suggest you stop wasting our
subscriptions on publishing c**p&nbsp;&ndash; like
<a href="../../../01/04/text/#article1">pages&nbsp;4</a> and
<a href="../../../01/48/text/#article1">48 of Issue&nbsp;80-1</a>.

Dear INMC80,
</p>
<p>
I was very pleased to hear that the INMC was back in business with the same committee.
INMC(80) News is by far the best of the microcomputer journals if you are a Nascom
owner. The only thing the others do better is get advertisements&nbsp;&ndash; good luck in your
efforts. Provided that they are Nascom-related I don&rsquo;t see any objection to much more
than the 5 pages you have suggested, provided of course that there is still some
editorial matter left. Related possibilities that you have probably considered already
are the insertion of separate advertising material when mailing the News, and using
the mailing list for an independent mailing shot of advertising matter. I&rsquo;m not
usually all that keen on being on mailing lists, but would welcome it in this case; it
isn&rsquo;t easy to keep track of all the hardware and software being offered for Nascoms
these days, though it is certainly encouraging that other manufacturers are showing so
much interest.
</p>
<p>
Could I suggest that a review of the ways of housing a Nascom would be useful&nbsp;? I have
a Vero frame&nbsp;&ndash; Vero&rsquo;s own, not the Nascom version&nbsp;&ndash; but am not all that pleased with
it, especially not with the accessories (front panels) which turn out to be unsuitable
for Nascom&nbsp;2 after they have been sold to you&nbsp;!
</p>

I&rsquo;m sure someone must have made the point, but as the statement has been printed twice
can I correct the impression that ED6B is an unpublished op code. It is in the manuals
as LD HL,(nn), although there is a shorter version: 2A. Similarly, ED7B, mentioned in
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/07/09/text/#article1">INMC News 7</a>
is listed as LD SP,(nn).
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely,<br>
G. DAVIES,<br>
