<h4>
The Belctra Manual
</h4>
<p>
The Belectra Manual is a scanty 6.5 pages long, and covers the essential
information about the
<?php externalLink("HSA-88B"); ?>
and its use of the
<?php externalLink("AM9511","Am9511",""); ?>. Two and a half pages
of it are taken up by an example assembly language program which computes the
squares of 16-bit integers between 0-255. This has been included as a
demonstration of the speed of the Am9511A, and they also suggest that you can
use it as test program to verify that the board works. For the major
programming information on the Am9511A, the manual points you at the Am9511A
data (also supplied).
</p>
<p>
There is just over a page on using the HSA-88B with a high level
Language. This covers, in a general way, all points I could think of, but I
would just like to quote one sentence from it. &ldquo;Assuming a <b>reasonably
experienced</b> assembly language programmer, the above procedure is not
difficult.&rdquo; (My highlighting.) I would guess the truth of the &lsquo;not difficult&rsquo;
in that statement will depend to a large degree on the compiler/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Interpreter
the programmer decides to tackle.
</p>
<p>
However the presentation of the manual is poor for a product costing
&pound;250+. It has been printed out on a dot-matrix printer, (not a crime in
itself), but it is one of those typefaces with no descenders. Also it has the
appearance of the &lsquo;bog standard&rsquo; output. Most reasonable matrix printers these
days offer an emphasised mode of printing, which, though slower, does offer a
higher quality of output. As the manual is relatively short, it could even
have been typed on the office typewriter.

<h4>
The Am9511A Data Sheet
</h4>
<p>
This is the one essential document for anyone who wants to use the HSA-88B,
but is not interested in <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal. It gives you an outline of how
the processor works, and a detailed breakdown of the instruction set. In fact
I started this review with just the board and an AMD data book. Hisoft Pascal
and the Belectra manual came later.

<h4>
Hisoft Pascal
</h4>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t intend this to be a review of Hisoft Pascal&nbsp;&ndash; I leave that to users like Dr Dark
<a href="../../14/text/#ref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&ndash; but I include here a few passing comments. (See also
the following section on support.)
</p>
<p>
The supplied manual is for Hisoft Pascal version 4D. I assume that Hisoft
Pascal 5, (supplied on the disc), is identical to 4, except with a small
change in the run-time routines. I could find no &ldquo;version differences&rdquo;
addendum sheet, although the Belectra manual refers to HP5 as having &ldquo;various
additional features&rdquo; over HP4.
</p>
<p>
I have two comments to make on the manual: two small points that
irritated me out of all proportion. The first is a subjective complaint
(almost &lsquo;nit picking&rsquo;), that I can&rsquo;t satisfactorily explain. The manual has
been printed on a dot-matrix printer with a very acceptable typeface, and I
have no objection to that, but I found parts of it very fatiguing to read. I
suppose it is more the resultant small variation in quality from letter to
letter that occurs in places in the manual that I find fatiguing, rather than
anything else. It may be the copying process that has highlighted this, rather
than the printer itself.
</p>
<p>
My second complaint is to do with the formatting of the manual. The
