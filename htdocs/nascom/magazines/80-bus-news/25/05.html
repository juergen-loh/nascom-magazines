situation can be much more closely controlled (a condition of sale could be a
signed acceptance of copyright terms), and the supplier gets at least some
payment for his effort! It is also sad (in certain ways), but relevant, that
the &lsquo;average&rsquo; Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini customer is nowadays tending to be an industrial
user rather than the &lsquo;old style&rsquo; Nascom hobbyist who used to spend many hours
pouring over machine code listings of the Nasbug monitor. Today&rsquo;s &lsquo;hobbyist&rsquo;
tends to play games on a Spectrum, with maybe a smattering of BASIC work. But
I digress, and would just end up with a little &lsquo;thought for the day&rsquo; (I claim
copyright unless anyone can establish &lsquo;prior art&rsquo;!):

I would like to congritulat all the contribtures to the first three
issues of the news I have seen (it&rsquo;s abusotlay amnasingly funay) and has a
rare clarity on technical matters (most of the time) it was worth beying my
system for it alone. Is it possible to obtain back coppes of the issues of
volume 1 and the odd coppies of INMC?

I would lick to add my name to the handfull of peopel willing to post a
disk as suggested by DARK&rsquo;S DIAR&rsquo;Y, my veray new and first system consits of
the following
<?php externalLink("GM810","",""); ?>,
<?php externalLink("GM813","",""); ?>,
<?php externalLink("GM812","",""); ?>,
<?php externalLink("GM829","",""); ?>,
GM664, NM I/O complete (excpt for
prom SPD/1-L(-H) which Nascom &amp; CIEL failed to supply). GM657, GM555, GM554,
GM523,
<?php externalLink("GM808"); ?>
and a modfied tv. As this is my first computer I have no diy
programs so far but I am keen to try to introduce a spelling option for
GEMPEN.

I have been soled on the Z80 and 80-BUS for the last two years since the
offer of &pound;150 to spend on a project put me on the road excpyt, it took till

[Ed.&nbsp;&ndash; Yes, I definitely agree that you would find a spelling option for
Gempen useful! But if you insist on writing the dictionary for it yourself
then please get someone else to check it! However, turning to several points
that you have raised (wrased?):&ndash;
</p>
<p>
<b>Back Issues.</b> All 80-BUS magazines are available as back issues&nbsp;&ndash; that is
Vol. 1 Issues 1-4 and Vol. 2 Issues 1-5 (so far). In addition most of the
INMC80 mags. are available as well as a Compilation Issue of &lsquo;The Best Of&rsquo;
INMC.
</p>
<p>
<b>Circle of Iron.</b> Doctor Dark&rsquo;s Circle of Iron is intended to consist of a
group of users posting a disk around in a circle, adding their programs to it,
and copying any of the ones already on it that they want. This is for your
programs, NOT <b>borrowed</b> ones. The intention is that there will be several
circles, for the various disk formats. The whole thing is very bravely being
organised by Chris Blackmore, who says that the response so far is nothing
short of dismal! No takers for FREE programs? Anyone interested should write
to Chris directly at __ ________ ______, Taunton, Somerset, ___ ___, saying
what disk format you use.
