To Read and then Write a Random file the steps are as follows :
</p>
<p class="noindent">
1) &nbsp; OPEN the file<br>
2) &nbsp; Declare the Fields<br>
3) &nbsp; GET the required Record from Disk, if records already exist, or INPUT the
	necessary data and build the record.<br>
4) &nbsp; Process the Fields<br>
5) &nbsp; PUT the record onto Disk.<br>
6) &nbsp; Repeat 3 to 6 until all done<br>
7) &nbsp; CLOSE the File<br>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
e.g.
</p>
<?php imageinsertGap($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-17-1.png"); ?>
<table>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;110</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>OPEN&rsquo;s the file, declares it as RANDOM, and describes it as File
&pound;1 until it is closed. The name of the Data file to be known as
File &pound;1 is RADIOLOG.DAT and it uses Records of 70 bytes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;120</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Sets up the FIELDS for file &pound;1. Each Field is given a Variable
name and its length is set.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;140</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>GET&rsquo;s each Record in turn from the Disk until the search either
succeeds or fails altogether.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;150</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Looks for match between INPUT data and Disk record data. (N.B. in
this simplified example, Line 150 will probably fail to work since
&ldquo;G30CB&rdquo; does NOT equal &ldquo;G30CB &nbsp; &ldquo;. To work correctly, the trailing
blanks would have to be removed, or the INPUT callsign padded
out to 8 characters with blanks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;160</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Continues looping until record found, or all done.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;170</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Prints appropriate message.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;180</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>CLOSEs the file.</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>
FIELDS
</h3>
<p>
Although it is possible to use the Data in the Fields directly, as in
line 150 above, it is normal practice to &lsquo;move&rsquo; the Data out of the Field
variable into some other variable for processing. There are several reasons
for this:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
1) The Field data will contain leading or trailing blanks which can lead to
unreliable results when Processing or Printing Data.<br>
2) Numeric data is stored in Fields as Strings. It must be converted back to
numeric form for calculations.<br>
3) Integers are stored as 2 Byte Fields, Single Precision as 4 Bytes, Double
Precision as 8 Bytes.<br>
4) It is often convenient to have the origional Field in uncorrupted form
during processing.
