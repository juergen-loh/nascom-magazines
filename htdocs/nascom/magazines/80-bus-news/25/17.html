To Read and then Write a Random file the steps are as follows :
</p>
<p>
O.B8&laquo;
</p>
<p>
OPEN the file
</p>
<p>
Declare the Fields
</p>
<p>
GET the required Record from Disk, if records already exist, or INPUT the
necessary data and build the record.
</p>
<p>
Process the Fields
</p>
<p>
PUT the record onto Disk.
</p>
<p>
Repeat 3 to 6 until all done
</p>
<p>
CLOSE the File
</p>
<p>
90 INPUT &ldquo;Enter CALL to be found. &ldquo;;CSGNS
</p>
<p>
100
110
120
150
140
150
160
170
180
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;do some input error checking here.
OPEN &ldquo;R",&pound;1, &ldquo;RADIOLOG. DAT&rdquo;, 70
FIELD&pound;1,18 AS NAMES,8 AS CALL$,20 AS TOWNS,16 AS COUNTY$,8 AS DATES
</p>
<p>
FOR RNUM=X TO Y &ldquo;X,Y define range of record numbers to be read.
GET&pound;1 , RNUM
</p>
<p>
IF CALL$=CSGN$ THEN GOTO xxxx
</p>
<p>
NEXT RNUM
</p>
<p>
PRINT &ldquo;Record not found. &ldquo;
</p>
<p>
CLOSE&pound;1
</p>
<p>
Line 110 &ndash; OPEN&rsquo;s the file, declares it as RANDOM, and describes it as File
</p>
<p>
&pound;1 until it is closed. The name of the Data file to be known as
File &pound;1 is RADIOLOG.DAT and it uses Records of 70 bytes.
</p>
<p>
Line 120 &ndash; Sets up the FIELDS for file &pound;1. Each Field is given a Variable
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Line 140
</p>
<p>
name and its length is set.
GET&rsquo;s each Record in turn from the Disk until the search either
succeeds or fails altogether.
</p>
<p>
Line 150 &ndash; Looks for match between INPUT data and Disk record data. (N.B. in
</p>
<p>
this simplified example, Line 150 will probably fail to work since
&ldquo;430CB&rdquo; does NOT equal &ldquo;G30CB &ldquo;. To work correctly, the trailing
blanks would have to be removed, or the INPUT callsign padded
out to 8 characters with blanks.
</p>
<p>
Line 160 &ndash; Continues looping until record found, or all done.
Line 170 &ndash; Prints appropriate message.
Line 180 &ndash; CLOSEs the file.
</p>
<p>
FIELDS
</p>
<p>
casement
</p>
<p>
Although it is possible to use the Data in the Fields directly, as in
</p>
<p>
line 150 above, it is normal practice to &lsquo;move&rsquo; the Data out of the Field
variable into some other variable for processing. There are several reasons
for this:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
1) The Field data will contain leading or trailing blanks which can lead to
</p>
<p>
unreliable results when Processing or Printing Data.
</p>
<p>
2) Numeric data is stored in Fields as Strings. It must be converted back to
numeric form for calculations.
</p>
<p>
3) Integers are stored as 2 Byte Fields, Single Precision as 4 Bytes, Double
Precision as 8 Bytes.
</p>
<p>
4) It is often convenient to have the origional Field in uncorrupted form
during processing.
