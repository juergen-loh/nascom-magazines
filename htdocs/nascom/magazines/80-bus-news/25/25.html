Here we are again! It only seems like yesterday that I finished the
previous one of these. [Ed. &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure there was something similar to this
said in
<a href="../../../23/03/text/#article2">Vol.2 Iss.3</a>.
Zero points for originality!] Anyway as promised...

NAS&shy;COM&nbsp;2 and <?php externalLink("2716","",""); ?>/<?php externalLink("2732"); ?> EPROMS
</h4>
<p>
A letter from Bill Stewart of Kings Lynn has prompted me to blow the dust
off my Nascom&nbsp;2. He has modified his N2 to take <?php externalLink("2716"); ?> EPROMs in place of the
<?php externalLink("2708","",""); ?>s in the eight sockets on the main pcb and has run into a speed problem.
He has found that he has to use wait states if he wants to execute code in the
2716s. (His system runs at 4MHz). His letter doesn&rsquo;t explain why, but he&rsquo;s
trying to squeeze the last drop of speed out of his N2, and his current target
is to only enable wait states while accessing the on-board EPROMs during M1
cycles.
</p>
<p>
Rather than tackling his problem directly, I&rsquo;ve taken one step back from
it to the question of how you should modify the N2 to support the 2716 &amp; 2732
type EPROMs. Bill doesn&rsquo;t say how he has modified his N2, but various
suggestions have been published in the NEWS [1][2][3]. I would hope that the
suggested approach below would allow the EPROMs to be used without wait
states. The 2716/32 type of EPROMs, as well as having a greater capacity than
the 2708 and only requiring a single +5v supply, also have a more more subtle
difference. When the 2716 was first introduced by Intel, if my memory serves
me right, pin 18 was designated PWR DWN, and pin 20 was /CS. (If you check the
data sheets you will find that the 2716s power consumption drops by about a
factor of 5 when pin 18 is at a &lsquo;1&rsquo;). Shortly afterwards they renamed the
pins, and pin 18 became /CE (Chip Enable) and pin 20 /0E (Output Enable). The
distinction is fairly important, and if you check the data sheet again you&rsquo;ll
see why. The access time for a standard 2716 is 450ns from the address lines
and the /CE pin, but only 120ns from the /OE pin. Thus in a memory system, in
order to make the most of the EPROM, the /CE decoding should be done as soon
as the address is available. Any later qualification, (like using /MREQ to
distinguish between a memory or an IO access), should preferably be applied to
the /OE signal. Also the 2-pin approach makes it easy to design systems
without memory contention problems.
