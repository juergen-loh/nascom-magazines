In the example above, we could have written:
</p>
<?php imageInsertMgz("Image-18-1.png"); ?>
<p>
The problem of the blanks would still remain though. One way of dealing
with the blanks is simply to read the Field from left to right and discard
blanks. This is O.K. until we realize that some Fields contain needed blanks
(e.g. SOUTH ROAD). A better way to deal with the problem is to deliberately
mark the end of the required data with a special Character:
</p>
<?php imageInsertMgz("Image-18-2.png"); ?>
<p>
Assuming use of a 20 byte field, and that the word &lsquo;LONDON&rsquo; is INPUT,
this would store the Field TOWN$ as &lsquo;LONDON* &nbsp; &lsquo;. To extract the
Town from the Disk Record, less blanks and Field terminator, the following
type of routine can be used&nbsp;:
</p>
<?php imageInsertMgz("Image-18-3.png"); ?>
<p>
The reason for using the &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; variables TEMP$ and OP$ is that all
Fields that need processing in this way can then use the same Subroutine.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;2010</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Ensures that the dummy variable is empty at the start.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;2020</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Sets up a loop equal to the length of the Field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;2030</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Reads the copy of the field stored in TEMP$ from left to right,
one character at a time. If the character found is a &ldquo;*&rdquo;, the
program skips to 2060 to return to the main flow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;2040</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>The character is added on to OP$.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Line&nbsp;2050</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>The loop continues until a &ldquo;*&rdquo; is found or the whole length of
the Field has been processed.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
There is thus no need to expand the Fields already declared to accomodate
the &ldquo;*&rdquo; character. If for example a &ldquo;*&rdquo; were added to the date: &ldquo;20/06/83*",
then since only 8 bytes have been allowed for the date Field, when LSET the
&ldquo;*&rdquo; would &ldquo;drop off the end&rdquo;. N.B. A &lsquo;RSET&rsquo; would have stored &ldquo;0/06/83*&rdquo; in
the Record Date Field.
</p>
<h3>
<u>USE of LSET and RSET to &lsquo;FIELD&rsquo; DATA.</u>
</h3>
<p>
When Data is stored in a Field, it is padded out with Blanks. The command
that achieves this is LSET or RSET.
