Reinsert IC46 while making sure that pins 3 and 13 remain
out of their respective holes. Connect the wire from pin 3
(decoder address A0) to pin 12 of workspace link block
(LKB9). (Connects to A11). Connect the wire from pin 13
(decoder address A1) to pin 9 of workspace link block
(LKB9). (Connects to A12). TEST. On LKB1 connect pin 5 to
pin 3. (Connects all pin 21s to +5V). TEST. Connect LKB8
pin 5 to LKB9 pin 10. (Connects all /OE pins to the /XROM
signal). TEST.

Now we come to setting up the decoding. What you do
now is a matter of taste. What I did was: Ensure LSW1
switch 8 up, switch 7 down. On LKS1 connect 4 to 6 and on
to TP13 (0V in bottom right corner)&nbsp;&ndash; this permanently
enables the decoder IC46. Connect any two desired 4k
blocks from their respective pins on LKS1 to pin 7
(/XROM). This gives a memory map of:

0000-07FF &nbsp; Nas-Sys<br>
0800-0FFF &nbsp; Video+Workspace<br>
1000-BFFF &nbsp; <?php externalLink("RAM&nbsp;B","Ram&nbsp;B",""); ?>(?)<br>
C000-DFFF &nbsp; 4 x <?php externalLink("2716"); ?> EPROMs<br>
E000-FFFF &nbsp; Basic.
</p>
<p>
Adding an external switch between IC6 pin 13 (or
lower end of R56) and Ground allows either bank of four
2716s to be switched in to the C000-DFFF address range. If
the full 16K is wanted on line together, then IC6 could be
connected to A13 rather than a switch. In either case it
might be advisable to lift the leg of IC6 from its socket
and make the connection direct. If you don&rsquo;t, your system
will crash if you absent mindedly close switch LSW1/7.
</p>
<p>
The modification for <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> EPROMs is very similar.
Instead of strapping pin 5 to pin 3 on LKB1 (to put 5V on
the pins 21), extend the under-board wiring of the pins
21 to pin 8 of the Basic ROM to pick up A11. The other
differences are concerned with the address decoding.
Connect pin 3 of IC46 to LKB9 pin 9 (to pick up A12). I
suggest that pin 13 of IC46 is connected to another
switch. The two switches now let you select one of four 8k
banks to occupy the selected 8k block of EPROM memory.
Obviously the switches could be replaced by address lines
as above. (In extremis this would give 32k of extra ROM&nbsp;&ndash;
makes the N2 a little bit like the BBC, all ROM and no
RAM!).
</p>
<p>
The more adventurous among you might like to replace
the switches by a 74LS74 and some additional logic, and
have software controlled selection of the EPROM banks via
an IO port .... even more like the BBC!

Returning briefly to the original question. Bill had already carried out
the standard modification of only enabling Wait states during M1 cycles, not
every memory cycle. (Looking at my N2 I see I did this by lifting the leg of
