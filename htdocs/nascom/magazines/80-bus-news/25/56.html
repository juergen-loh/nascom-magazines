Having got the plates, I got out the steel rule, pop punch and
electric drill and started work. I had decided where the plugs for keyboard,
serial I/O, mains, video and other connectors were to go on the end plates, so
these were painstaking chopped out, the smaller ones using a selection of Q-Max
punches, the larger ones drilled and then opened up with a metal fret saw
and filed to shape. One end plate would carry a 5" Muffin fan to keep the
whole lot cool whilst the other end plate had all the holes for the sockets
and the mountings for the power supply. The fan presented a problem. I could
not find any metal mesh to cover the fan opening, and leaving it open would
leak RF like a sieve, so I marked out about 500 3 mm holes over the intake
area of the fan and spent an entertaining evening drilling them all out. As
the box in its finished form would be almost airtight, I had to drill a
gimilar number of ventilation holes in the other end plate to exhaust the air
sucked in by the fan. The intake and exhaust holes for the fan had to be
fairly small, as I didn&rsquo;t want to take any chance of RF leaks. Large holes let
RF out!! Making all these holes neat and tidy was no easy task.

With the two finished end plates, I started assembling the box. The
two side plates were fitted to the base plate in turn, held in place with
engineers clamps and a row of holes spaced at 1" was first piloted and then
drilled out to 3.3 mm through the side plates into the base plate flanges. The
two side plates were then pop rivetted to the base plate. Similarly, the two
end plates were clamped to the now fitted side plates and drilled and rivetted
in a like manner. This made a nice substantial box without a lid, it was even
reasonably square. The box went back to Smiths and a tight fitting flanged lid
was then made to fit. The whole lot cost about a tenner, but I dare say that
was a special price to me as they owed me a couple of favours. Anyway the box
was a lot cheaper than buying a ready made frame and box.

The seven slot mother board was made from 8" wide Veroboard and the
positions of the mounting holes marked and drilled on the base plate. The lid
was drilled for a number of PK self tapping screws. The time came for a dummy
assembly and to see if I had forgotten any holes. The whole lot seemed to fit
together, the fan, the PSU, the mother board, the sockets and all,-so the
whole thing was taken to pieces again. The outside of the box was then painted
in dark blue Hammerite paint making sure to mask things like earth points,
etc.

The fateful day arrived, the whole lot was reassembled in the box,
wired up and switched on for the first time. One thing was immediately
apparrent, the fan make an awful racket and the amount of air rushing through
the box was overkill in the extreme, more like a wind tunnel than a computer
box. On the basis that large diameter slow moving fans are quiet, some way of
slowing the fan down had to be found. Simple, a 0.33uF 600V paper capacitor in
series with the fan dropped the supply to about 90V, the fan ran a lot slower
and was very much quieter. Was the cooling now adequate? Having left the thing
on for several hours with all the cards in revealed a temerature rise of all
of 10 degrees C so I guessed it was all Ok.

Did it cure the RFI? Well no, not entirely. There was still a lot of
keyboard polling noise which inexplicably did not go away when I detached the
keyboard. It went away when I detached the printer!! So the printer cable was
replaced with a screened cable, leaving the keyboard ribbon cable as before.
Still not quite right, the interference shot up when the disks started up so
