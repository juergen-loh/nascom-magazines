power and reset switches are also mounted on the back panel, along with the
quick release fan filter and a blanked off hole approximately 1&Prime; by 2.5&Prime; to
allow connection to be made to any expansion cards fitted by the user which
require leads to external equipment, etc. All connectors on the back panel are
clearly labelled and an adequate description of each is provided in the
manual.

<h3>
The Keyboard
</h3>
<p>
The keyboard is separately detachable and mounted in a steel case.
Connection is made by a multiway 36&Prime; coiled cable which expands to about 80&Prime;.
This makes for neat and tidy connection, but unfortunately the connector on
the keyboard is on the right hand side of back panel of the keyboard case
which means that if the cable is laid &lsquo;naturally&rsquo;, it runs from the left hand
side of the computer across to the keyboard connector on the other side of the
keyboard case. This means that more of the cable is in view than would be
strictly necessary had the keyboard connector been fitted to the left hand
side. The keyboard is of high quality with a light yet positive touch and is a
full function keyboard with a standard QWERTY layout. Ten function keys, four
cursor control keys and a numeric pad are also provided. An unusual feature of
the function keys is that the cursor and numeric pad keys may also be
programmed as function keys. Additionally, the functions can also be shifted
so that each programmable key may serve a dual function. This gives access to
no less than 60 fully programmable function keys if required. This feature
would commonly be used with programs such as WORDSTAR, where the numeric pad
would be reprogrammed as the WORDSTAR cursor keys. The only criticism of the
keyboard as such is the cursor keys themselves which are, in my opinion, badly
positioned and psychologically in the wrong order. The order could be changed
by reprogramming but this should not be necessary on a machine like the
Galaxy. Programming the function keys from the keyboard is simple from within
the CP/M command mode (and often from within programs) and a utility program
is provided to store the reprogrammed key patterns for instant recall at a
later date.

<h3>
The Disk Drives
</h3>
<p>
The drives fitted as standard are the Micropolis 1115F-V 96 track per
inch, single sided 80 track drives working in a double density MFM format.
These drives are extremely solidly built and use such advanced techniques as
phase locked motor speed control and an internal dedicated processor. They are
widely recognised as being one of the best and most reliable drives available.
The Micropolis drives give a formatted space of 400K, which, when system
tracks and directory areas are taken into account, leave the user with 388K of
useable disk space per drive. A factory option is to fit the Micropolis 1115F-VI
drives which are of similar specification but double sided, providing a
useable space of 788K per drive. The drives are loaded in the conventional
manner with flap doors; no spring disk eject mechanism is fitted. A small
point is that with the drives mounted vertically, there is no obvious &lsquo;up&rsquo;
when inserting disks in the disk drives, and although obvious to the
experienced user, it is only too easy for the inexperienced to put a disk into
the drive &lsquo;upside down&rsquo; and to suffer a failure of the system to boot. A point
not covered in the manual.
</p>
<p>
An interesting point if the double sided 1115F-VI drives are fitted is
that the Galaxy could be used to read disks from many other machines
(including Gemini&rsquo;s earlier double density machines). As the drive head step
pitch is the now standard 96 tracks per inch, and as the standard pitch of
