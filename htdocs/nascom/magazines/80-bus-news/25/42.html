<h3>
Internal Layout
</h3>
<p>
Internally the layout of the Galaxy is simple and compact. At the rear
of the case is the fan and power supply unit. The fan ran reasonably quietly
and was certainly an improvement over the fans fitted to earlier Galaxy 1&rsquo;s.
The power supply is a switch mode one, fully RF screened and with impressive
mains supply filtering. No effects of mains glitches were observed even under
the &lsquo;dirtiest&rsquo; of mains conditions. The drives are fitted to the front panel
immediately in front of the power supply and solidly secured to a sub-chassis
on the base of the computer case. To the left of the drives is a card cage
which contains six card slots. The three lower slots contain the three modular
cards needed for the standard Galaxy, the upper three are empty and are
available for expansion. As mentioned earlier a blanked off hole is provided
on the back panel adjacent to the card cage to allow entry for leads which
might need to be connected to any envisaged expansion cards. Air flow through
the case is dictated by the position of the ventilation slots on the sides and
to the front of the case top wrapper. There are no slots on the top of the
case, so the computer is reasonably safe against spilt coffee, etc. Having
removed the top cover, it is only too easy to replace it the wrong way round
and so restrict the ventilation although no harm seems come if this
accidentally happens, indicating more than adequate cooling.

<p>
The standard Galaxy is fitted with three cards, the CPU/RAM card, the
disk controller card and the video card. As is to be expected, all three cards
are engineered to the highest standards, the pc layout whilst compact, is
orderly and neat, with gold flashed connectors, pc solder resist and component
legend screening on the fibreglass boards. The boards are flow soldered with
the ICs socketed where necessary. Good quality components are used throughout

<h3>
The CPU Card
</h3>
<p>
The CPU card contains the main processor, a 4MHz Z80A. The clock speed
is 4MHz without wait states. The board also incorporates 64K of 4164 dynamic
RAM and the 2K simple monitor/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>boot EPROM. A Z80A PIO device takes care of the
parallel I/O, normally used for the &lsquo;Centronics&rsquo; protocol parallel interface,
whilst a WD8250 serial controller provides RS232 I/O and full modem control. A
number of links are provided for reconfiguring the board for specialist
purposes which are fully detailed in an optional manual for the card. All I/O
to the bus is fully buffered with considerable expansion in mind. The RAM and
ROM are paged and can be selected and deselected from software. The software
is so arranged that the EPROM is normally paged out of the system on boot up,
leaving the whole of the 64K RAM available for CP/M. The RAM is similarly
paged, with extended addressing to 2M byte. This means that implementation of
CP/M Plus (CP/M 3.x) will present no particular problems as the additional RAM
required for this operating system could be provided by the inclusion of the
Gemini GM802 64K expansion RAM card, which already exists within the Gemini
range of expansion cards.

<h3>
The Disk Controller Card
</h3>
<p>
The disk controller card features the Western Digital WD1797 three
chip disk controller set, and incorporates software controlled clock rate
select for 5.25" or 8" drives. Connectors are provided for the standard 5.25"
and 8" drive connectors, whilst a third connector is used for the SASI
interface to Winchester hard disks. This card is extremely flexible in its own
right, although normally only used to drive the internal 5.25" drives. 8"
drives and a Winchester drive can be fitted externally and because of the
software selectable clock rates and the SASI interface, given the correct
