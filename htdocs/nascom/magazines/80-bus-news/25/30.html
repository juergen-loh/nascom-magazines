command which will load an ASAVEd program and merge it with an existing
program already in the computer. Care in the use of this is necessary as the
programs are just merged as they stand, so if line numbers are duplicated in
the programs being merged, the resultant program will have more than one line
with the same number.

<p>
Program lines may be generated and manipulated by AUTO, COPY, DELETE,
EDIT &amp; <span class="uppercase">Renumber</span> commands. AUTO will start at 10 with an interval of 10 unless
otherwise instructed. COPY enables blocks of lines (or single lines) to be
copied to elsewhere in a program. This command produces an error if copying
would overwite existing lines. DELETE will delete a block of lines. Start and
finish lines must exist or an error message will be generated. EDIT allows
line editing of the up to 256 character lines which BAS12K supports. While not
as convenient in some ways as screen editing, the editor is powerful and
convenient once you become accustomed to it. Its commands are very similar to
those
<a href="../../../23/13/text/#article1">outlined for MBASIC</a>
in 80BUS News for May-June 1983. <span class="uppercase">Renumber</span> renumbers
the whole program, default start and interval 10, but other starts and
intervals may be specified.
</p>
<p>
As well as REM, BAS12K supports the single quote and that quote suffices
in place of the &ldquo;:REM&rdquo; which otherwise would be needed to seperate program
from comment.
</p>
<p>
An <span class="uppercase">Exchange</span> (swap) command allows string or numeric variables to be
exchanged but only within their own types. This makes for convenient writing
of alpha or numeric sort routines.
</p>
<p>
A TRACE command causes print out of line numbers as they are executed.
The command takes a numeric non-zero argument to switch trace on and a zero
argument to stop it. There is also an LTRACE commeand which directs the output
to the serial port for a suitable printer.
</p>
<p>
Like TRACE, PRINT and PRINT USING have their version with preceeding &lsquo;L&rsquo;
to direct their output to printer.
</p>
<p>
Another useful additional command is LVAR (and its print version LLVAR)
which lists all variables (other than array variables) and their values. One
can STOP a program, examine the variables, alter one or more, and then
CONTinue, provided you haven&rsquo;t altered the program.
</p>
<p>
BAS12K also features multi-line user-defined functions. Such functions
are like Pascal functions in that local variables may be used in calculating
the value to be returned to the main program.
</p>
<p>
While BAS12K does not have its own screen edit facility, it is possible
to use the screen edit which forms part of the Nasmon monitor. From BAS12K
this is entered via the SCREEN command. Text edited with the Nasmon editor may
afterwards be converted back to BAS12K. The limitation on this option is that
it may only be used if there is sufficient space in memory for the BASIC
program to be stored in both formats at the same time. The Nasmon editor is
essentially the editor now incorporated in <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal about which there has
been considerable favourable comment from Dr Dark and others.
</p>
<p>
All in all, I have found BAS12K and the Nasmon monitor, which I had
perforce to adopt to use the former, to be a very useful package. Having the
Nasmon monitor, I also got the Nasgen assembler to go with it (Oh, how much
faster than ZEAP!) and the same supplier&rsquo;s dis-assembler, Nasnem. This is a
pure diassembler as Nasmon itself incorporates a &lsquo;front panel&rsquo; system etc. to
allow debugging of machine code programs. I must confess however that I have
not done much machine code work with this monitor as I have not found it as
easy to understand as Nas-Sys, maybe because it does not come with the fully
commented source code such as accompanies Nas-Sys.
