MDIS is an intelligent dis-assembler program for taking CP/M machine
code programs apart for examination or modification. MDIS will
dis-assembie both Z80 and 8080 code, using the correct mnemonics in
either case. Labelling is automatic and tables are dealt with in an
intelligent fashion by reporting data areas in &lsquo;defined byte&rsquo; form with an
ASCH printout alongside, allowing the programmer to decide whether
the table is a text string or access table, etc.
</p>
<p>
The dis-assembled output is entirely compatible with the popular ;
Microsoftx M80 assembler and L80 linker, whilst the input command : ie&nbsp;. op
syntax is designed to be similar to the Microsoft utilities, making MOIS iMag SUL A/.\y me
</p>
<p>
particularly easy to use. .
The MDIS output may be either to disk or hard copy and is easily edited (&pound;57.50 INC VAT) ,
into forms suitable for assemblers other than the Microsoft types. 1 UK POST FREE :

MDIS provides a low cost solution to all Z80/8080 dis-assembly needs
and is suitable for all CP/M based machines.
