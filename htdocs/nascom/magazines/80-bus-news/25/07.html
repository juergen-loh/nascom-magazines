Personally I think that the 8-bit micro has still got a lot of life left
in it, and in many applications a switch to a 16-bit processor will bring
little or no improvement. However, one area that can show a very marked
increase in performance, is in those applications involving a lot of number
crunching. The direct mathematical ability of microprocessors is limited, and
anything but the simplest calculations have to be emulated in software. The
16-bit processors gain here by working with a larger word size which results
in fewer steps to arrive at a result of similar precision. But even in this
field the balance can be redressed with the addition of a separate number
crunching unit.

The idea of a &lsquo;bolt-on&rsquo; floating point unit to improve performance pre-dates
the microprocessor, and in the micro field a few devices have been
around for while. The early approach was to add a slave processor, though the
current trend seems to be towards a co-processor. (&rsquo;Slave&rsquo; and &lsquo;Co-&rsquo; are my
own definitions. Other people&rsquo;s usage may be different.)
</p>
<p>
The co-processor is exemplified by the Intel 8087. This is a numeric
processor specifically designed for the Intel 8088/8086 family to carry out
high precision integer and floating point instructions. It connects to the
data bus in parallel with the CPU and effectively becomes an extension of the
CPU. The 8087 has a few direct connections to the CPU, and by monitoring these
and the instructions being fetched by the CPU, it can track exactly the
instructions being executed. There are certain reserved instructions in the
8086/8 instruction set that are specifically acted upon by the co-processor,
while the CPU responds to the same instruction in a supporting role. (e.g. It
may go on to fetch an operand from memory so that 8087 can capture it from the
data bus.) The co-processor is far more complex than the CPU, and the volume
of sales is not so high. As a result this is reflected in the price. A recent
price list puts the one-off price of an 8088 at &pound;16.80, with the companion
8087 at &pound;173.30. (N.B. IC prices quoted here are distributors prices, NOT
retail prices.)

The slave processor approach is different, although the end result is the
same. Here an autonomous processor is built, either from discrete logic (e.g.
using a bit-slice approach), or integrated directly on silicon. In this case
the arithmetic processor is a peripheral, and not tied to any particular
microprocessor. In use it is explicitly passed one or more operands by the
master CPU, followed by an instruction of what it is to with them. (e.g.
divide one by the other.) The specialist processor then carries out the task,
and reports when it is complete, at which point the host CPU can read back the
result. For the single chip implemenation there are two types of processor
available, low cost or high cost:

Examples of the low-end devices are the National MM57109 maths processor,
and the TMS1018. These are basically off-shoots of calculator ICs&nbsp;&ndash; ie. they
are cheap, use 4-bit processors, are BCD orientated, and are slow. (The
MM57109 will multiply two 8-digit mantissa, 2-digit exponent, numbers together
in about 116ms. It is actually quicker to do the calculations directly on a
Z80.) At the other end of the spectrum are the Advanced Micro Devices
<?php externalLink("AM9511","Am9511",""); ?>,
Am9512, and the Intel 8231, &amp; 8232. The AMD devices have been with us for
about five years, and are custom designed NMOS 16-bit processors whose sole
task is to crunch numbers. (e.g. dividing one 32-bit floating point number by
another takes under 100uS&nbsp;&ndash; over 1000 times faster than the MM57109.) But with
