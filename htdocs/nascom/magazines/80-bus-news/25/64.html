record numbers and N is the number of records a search for I$ would go
something like this:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageInsertMgz("Image-64-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
This would acceptably fast as the search of the arrays would only take a
second or so, but the limitation would be the space available for the arrays.
Even if the contents of the key array were kept small, and the record number
array made integer you could only keep track of a couple of thousand records
before the dreaded OM error would occur, the reason being that although the
array may only be a few K long in total, BASIC has to keep pointers to the
arrays which naturally gobbles space.
</p>
<p>
Now the contents of the arrays must have come from somewhere
originally, and we may presuppose that they would have been constructed as
sequential files on disk and on start-up read directly into the arrays. So the
information in the arrays is already available from disk. A variation on the
theme would be to perform the search for the record number directly from disk,
thus:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageInsertMgz("Image-64-2.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
Now this would be somewhat slower, but has the advantage that any number of
records (within the limits of disk size) may be accomodated. Notice that the
key string is the first four bytes of J$ and the record number is held as a
string in the last four bytes of J$. The major snag is updating the index.
</p>
<p>
A further thing about indices is that they may of course alter the
order of a random access file. For instance, we wish to look at the random
records in alphabetical key order. It would be a major job to sort any
sizeable random database into alphabetical order, whereas sorting the index
into order and then reading the random records in sequential index order would
be a lot less time consuming albeit somewhat slower on display as each random
record would have to be read separately and there would inevitably be lot head
shifting to be done. The problem arises in sorting the sequential index, or
getting it into order in the first place. Sequential files are not easily
modified. Any change requires the file to be copied entirely which becomes a
bit tedious (if not time comsuming). For instance, let us suppose we are
keeping FRED.NDX in alphabetical order and wish to insert a new key entry, I$
with its appropriate record number I. We must look through FRED.NDX
sequentially, test if I$ is greater or lesser that the current input J$, if it
is not write out the current J$ to a new file. If the current J$ is greater
than I$ then write out the current I$, followed by the current J$, and then
continue copying J$ to the end of the file. Something like this.
