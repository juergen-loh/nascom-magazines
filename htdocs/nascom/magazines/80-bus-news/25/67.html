drafts, and documents of ail kinds. DISKPEN is
particularly easy to use as itis designed for users
familiar with the normal office typewriter but
otherwise untrained in the use of word processors

<p>
DISKPEN also incorporates a number of optional&rdquo;
extensions for more specialist res. These provide
an integrated approach to the rec: tirements of not
only the small office, but also the &ldquo;ome and the
laboratory. The MAXIFILE extension gives DISKPEN
the ability to be used as a free field database
controller for the keeping of stock records. staff
records, for use as a day book, home record
keeping, cross reference index, Icybook, etc. The
only limitation on the use of MAXIFILE is the users
imagination. The SPooLER extension js particularly
useful in the preparation of repetitive letters,
allowing the printing of one document whilst the
next is being prepared. MULTIFORMAT is a further
extension for printing columns of text. This may be
used for the presentation of price lists, etc.

one, SPeLLAID is a proof reading spelling correction
extension, whilst CALCPAC adds arithmetic
