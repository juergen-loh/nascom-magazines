was no way I would ever get permission to hook a home brewed heap like that up
to British Telecom&rsquo;s lines. You have to have one of the acceptable machines,
like the grossly overpriced BBC machine with its pathetic 32K, or a Spectrum.
So I am going to connect my Spectrum up to Micronet. I may also be able to
link the Spectrum to Marvin, if the circuit I am trying to design works. No
doubt, if it does not, I shall have a dead Spectrum to bury! Further progress
will be reported as soon as there is any. I am still waiting 28 days for the
modem to arrive&hellip;

Remember the Marx Brothers film, where Groucho dictates a letter to his
dentist, &ldquo;Please find enclosed a cheque for $500&rdquo;? When Chico asks if he
should put the cheque in, Groucho says &ldquo;You do and I&rsquo;ll fire you!&rdquo; In his
letter advising me of the deadline for this issue, our noble editor asked me
to put this article on &ldquo;the enclosed disk&rdquo;. Well, I looked ever so carefully,
but there was no sign of any disc! Still, he didn&rsquo;t forget to send me a
cheque, so all is forgiven&hellip;
