Using the HSA-88B with other languages.
</h4>
<p>
I decided it would be instructive to try to use the processor from
another language. My current language is C in the form of the C/80 compiler
from the Software Toolworks (highly recommended). The version I run does not
support floating point numbers, but then as I don&rsquo;t use them I find this no
loss. A few moments thought showed that it would be very easy to add support
for the arithmetic processor with this compiler, (in fact I first tried the
board out with a simple C program), but I decided that it would be more
instructive to try to add support to something like the ubiquitous Microsoft
Basic80.
</p>
<p>
The benchmark above indicated that the Microsoft interpreter and its
companion compiler use the same arithmetic subroutines, and as the benchmark
for the compiler was only 20% faster than the interpreter I decided to use the
interpreter rather than tackle the run-time routines of the compiler.
</p>
<p>
The easiest (although slightly clumsy) way to interface the card would be
by the USR or CALL interface, but I decided to try to patch the interpreter
directly. On turning up appendix C of the MBasic manual I encountered problem
number one. The two floating formats are not identical (see below). However
they are basically similar, so it is not out of the question to interface the
<?php externalLink("HSA-88B"); ?>
to the interpreter.

The mantissa is expressed as a 24-
bit (fractional) value; the
exponent is expressed as an un-biased
two&rsquo;s complement 7-bit value
having a range of &minus;64 to +63. The
most significant bit is the sign of
the mantissa (0=positive,
1=negative), for a total of 32
bits. The binary point is assumed
to be to the left of the most
significant mantissa bit (bit 23).
All floating-point data values must
be normalised. Bit 23 must be equal
to 1, expect for the value zero,
which is represented by all zeros.

The mantissa is expressed as a 24-
bit (fractional) value with the
leading 1 suppressed (implied) and
the binary point is to the left of
the most significant bit; the
exponent is expressed as a biased
8-bit number having a bias of 128.
The sign of the mantissa is in bit
23 (0=positive, 1=negative).
The number zero is represented by
a number with an exponent of 0.

The two are similar, and re-arranging a few of the bits can get them to
line up, but the only problem is that the Microsoft exponent range is +127 to
&minus;127, as opposed to the &minus;64 to +63 of the Am9511. As this was just an
exploratory hack, I took the easy way out and ignored this!
