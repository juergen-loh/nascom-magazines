Another aside, I&rsquo;m writing these little routines straight off the top
of my head, so they are untested and there are liable to be bugs or syntax
errors, so, for any mistakes, you have my apologies, and if you care to write
a complete database handler (without mistakes) from these routines we may well
publish it. Anyway the sequential file alphabetical update:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageInsertMgz("Image-65-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
Now a number of different ways of doing this is possible. This routine uses
two loops, but it is entirely possible to make the routine smaller using one
loop and a flag, or flag out the J$ &lt;= I$ test after the insertion has
occurred. There are lots of ways of doing this, it just depends on what grabs
you at the time. The nett result is a new file FRED.NDX with the new I$
inserted at the appropriate place.

The final aside for this time, I&rsquo;ve just phoned Paul and he says he
wants this stuff by tomorrow lunch time (otherwise he won&rsquo;t pay for lunch),
and as it&rsquo;s five past midnight I&rsquo;l have to draw the line here:
</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr><td style="width: 6em">The line &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&gt;</td><td style="vertical-align: middle"><?php hLine("80%"); ?></td></tr>
</table>
<br id="article1">
<?php imageCenterMgz("Image-65-2.png"); ?>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
