Another aside, I&rsquo;m writing these little routines straight off the top
of my head, so they are untested and there are liable to be bugs or syntax
errors, so, for any mistakes, you have my apologies, and if you care to write
a complete database handler (without mistakes) from these routines we may well
publish it. Anyway the sequential file alphabetical update:
</p>
<p>
10 OPEN &ldquo;I",&pound;1, &ldquo;FRED.NDX&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
20 OPEN &ldquo;0",&pound;2,"FRED1.NDX&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
30 IF EOF(1) THEN 60
</p>
<p>
40 INPUTS1, J$
</p>
<p>
50 IF J$ &lt;= I$ THEN PRINT&pound;2,J$: GOTO 30
</p>
<p>
60 I1$=SPACE$(4): LSET I1$=STRS(I): I$=I$+11$
7O PRINTE&pound;2, I$
</p>
<p>
80 IF NOT EOF(1) THEN PRINTS&pound;2, J$
</p>
<p>
90 IF EOF(1) THEN 110
100 INPUT&pound;1,J$: PRINT&pound;2,J$: GOTO 90
110 CLOSE
120 KILL &ldquo;FRED.NDX&rdquo;: NAME &ldquo;FRED1.NDX&rdquo; AS &ldquo;FRED.NDX&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Now a number of different ways of doing this is possible. This routine uses
two loops, but it is entirely possible to make the routine smaller using one
loop and a flag, or flag out the J$ &lt;= I$ test after the insertion has
occurred. There are lots of ways of doing this, it just depends on what grabs
you at the time. The nett result is a new file FRED.NDX with the new I$
inserted at the appropriate place.
</p>
<p>
The final aside for this time, I&rsquo;ve just phoned Paul and he says he
wants this stuff by tomorrow lunch time (otherwise he won&rsquo;t pay for lunch),
and as it&rsquo;s five past midnight I&rsquo;l have to draw the line here:

The &pound;V667 &lsquo;Bleep&rsquo; is a useful accessory for the GM812 I.V.C. or Nascom&nbsp;2. The sound
has four adjustable parameters and is triggered by an ASCII BELL control code
blee (CHR$(7)). Designed using low power CMOS logic and the latest piezo-ceramic
transducer, the board measures 66x37x11 mm. Quickly and easily fitted with only
three wires qiving a low profile assembly. &pound; 12.50 + VAL
The EV814 IEEE 488 bus controller card meets 80-BUS and NASBUS
specifications to provide a low cost method of using IEEE and GPIB bus
IEEE 488 devices. The application is not limited to automatic test equipment,
fast data transfer, multiple printers or data collection. Multiple
boards have been used to construct Network systems which rival the speed of twisted pair networks
with inherent collision detection and interrupt type protocols, with multiple printers attached to
the Bus. Resident software support for this card is in the form of a 4K byte Bus Operating System
contained in Page-Moded EPROM coupled into system memory by a reserved area of memory. This card
costs &pound;140.00 plus VAT. Other related products: Software utility disk &pound; 10.00+VAT includes B.0.5S.
source. Paper listing of B.0.S. is &pound; 10.00 (a lot of paper, so no VAT). The hardware and software
manuals are available for &pound;5.00 each (no VAT).
