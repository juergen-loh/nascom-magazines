Who among you has suffered the trauma of having purchased at great
expense a wonderful new colour card and then realised that you have weeks of
work ahead of you creating some sort of software interface to your favourite
language? As is often the case you will have to create a library of low level
primitives armed only with boundless enthusiasm and a manual whose flashy
cover does not reflect its contents. Fear not, for the cavalry is on its way.
The Digital Research GSX graphics system will relieve you of this tiresome
task, leaving you time to get on with what you originally had in mind (Maybe
seeing your family and friends once in a while.)
</p>
<p>
GSX (Graphics System Extension) allows you to write application programs
in any language that supports BDOS calls, and provides you with an environment
that is independent of the device(s) that will eventually display the end
product. Along with 2 other DR products, GSS Kernel and GSS Plot, you are able
to program graphics applications that conform to the emerging Graphical Kernel
system (GKS), a draft international graphics standard. Kernel and Plot are not
essential to you, and you do not have to use them in order to produce
graphical routines, but they do provide a friendlier interface to GSX giving
you access to a standard library accessable from popular high level languages.
DR have specified Pascal, Fortran and PL/I so far. The whole thing is similar
in concept to the relationship between the BDOS and BIOS in that you have a
standard interface to custom built device drivers.
</p>
<p>
Having decided that this is for you, off you trot to your friendly
software dealer with your loot in your hand and swop it for the GSX80 (or
GSX86) disk. For your money you will have received the following:
</p>
<p class="exdent">
GSX.SYS &ndash; This is the actual GDOS that will load itself into memory and
process all your graphics calls.
</p>
<p class="exdent">
GENGRAF.COM &ndash; A utility program which is run against a graphics program once
it has reached the .COM stage. GENGRAF attaches a GSX loader to your
program. The GSX loader receives control as soon as the program is run,
its purpose is to handle the loading of GSX.SYS, the rearrangement of the
BDOS pointers, and then the loading of the assignment table ASSIGN.SYS
(see below) along with the first device driver that is specified, which
must also be the biggest. Once it has finished its work the loader brings
down the application program from its position above the loader to the
start of the TPA at 100H and executes it.
</p>
<p class="exdent">
ASSIGN.SYS &ndash; This is an ASCII file containing the device driver numbers and
names that you want to use in your particular system. As it is possible
to have only one device driver in memory at any one time GSX has to refer
to the table contained in ASSIGN.SYS in order to select new drivers when
they are required by the system. The copy that you find on your master
disk will contain the names of a few of the sample device drivers
supplied to you on the disk, and as such will have to be altered to suite
the drivers that you will be using.
</p>
<p class="exdent">
A number of ready to go device drivers &ndash; This sounds good doesn&rsquo;t it? We have
just bought the disk and we are off already. However, the bottom line
here is that unless you own a Hewlett Packard 7220 plotter, a Digital
Engineering Retro-Graphics colour monitor, or an Epson MX-80 with
Graftrax plus, these drivers are not going to be of much use to you.
