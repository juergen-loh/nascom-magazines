Ok, now on to clocks and dBASE. The same process is used, just the
programs are different. Firstly the clock call routine for the GM816, this is
likely to be the more popular. Idon&rsquo;t include any utilities for setting the
clock as both the GM816 and the GM822 are sufficiently reliable to only
require setting every now and then by separate utilities described in their
respective manuals.
</p>
<p>
See Listing Three
This lot comes down to a neat and tidy little piece so
</p>
<p>
STORE 49152 TO s:time
SET CALL TO s:time
</p>
<p>
POKE 49152,195,20,192
</p>
<p>
POKE 49172, 14,33, 6,11, 33,9, 192, 12, 237, 162, 32, 251,6,4, 33,9
</p>
<p>
POKE 49188, 192,17, 8,192,205, 60, 192, 40, 231, 16,249,205, 85,192, 40,224
PORE 49204, 18,27, 205, 60, 192, 40, 217, 201, 205, 85, 192, 200, 79, 205, 85, 192
POKE 49220, 200, 197,203, 39, 79,203, 39,203, 39,129, 193,129, 18,27,175,61
POKE 49236, 201, 126,35, 230, 15, 254, 15, 201
</p>

Note that in this routine the 1l registers are first read into an 11 byte
workspace, the results are then converted from the decimal one byte per digit
into HEX numbers in a second workspace, as dBASE requires the numbers stored
in HEX. It is then a simple matter of PEEKing the workspace to extract the
time and date. The order is thus:
</p>
<p>
sitimet3 = month
sitimet4 = day of week
sitimet5S = day of month
sitimet6 = hours
sitimet+t7 = minutes
</p>
<p>
si:timet8 = seconds
</p>
<p>
Listing Four is an extract from my radio logbook program which firstly
shoves the correct time at the SVC and then picks up a logon string for later
use. This is for the GM816. The same is true for the GM822 hung on a PIO
device. The routine is quite a bit larger, but the output format is the same.
In this instance the port decode was Ich &ndash; 1fh, if you want it any different,
then you can unscramble it and disassemble it yourself. See Listing Five.
</p>
<p>
Naturally these routines could be used with any high level language which
has the ability to PEEK and POKE and to CALL user subroutines. The principles
are the same regardless, but care should be taken as to where they are put as
some parts of programs could crash into them if they are located at c0000h, or
worse, they could be moved by the program itself.
