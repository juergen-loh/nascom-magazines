<h3>
Questionnaire
</h3>
<p>
I was wrong (just). In my last Editorial I said that I did not expect us
to receive more than 20 per cent of the Questionnaires back. Well, they are
still coming in (very very slowly) and there is a miniscule danger that we may
reach 30 per cent. As we have never sent out anything like this before, I am
uncertain as to how good a response this is, but it has certainly been giving
Steve, who was &lsquo;volunteered&rsquo; to type the results into a database, plenty to be
getting on with.
</p>
<p>
What has been fascinating is seeing the number of different ways people
have been finding of filling them in. I thought, obviously somewhat
foolishly, that there could only be one interpretation of how we expected the
answers to be entered. Oh no, everybody has got their own idea, and some
questionnaires have come back absolutely covered from wall to wall in writing.
Steve has therefore had to spend a considerable amount of time working out
how to extract useful information. We will be publishing the results soon,
and I hope that all Steve&rsquo;s efforts have been worthwhile. A special thanks to
all those who have responded. And if you are one of the 70 per cent (the
silent majority) who has not returned the Questionnaire, then there may still
be time, although you have not been included in the prize draw. On that
subject, we will be publishing the names of the winners in the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue.

<h3>
Names and Addresses
</h3>
<p>
Over the years various people have asked us to give them the names and
addresses of other 80-BUS News subscribers in their areas. This seems like a
very good way of getting people in touch with each other, as, for example,
does either of two of the subscribers in Harrow, who live at numbers 70 and 77
of a particular road, know that there is another 80-BUS user so near? We have
not previously released this sort of information as we respect that people may
wish to maintain privacy. However what we have decided to do, with your
permission, is publish your names and addresses in the magazine. When you
receive your subscription reminder you will find that there is a &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; box and
a &lsquo;No&rsquo; box alongside a question as to whether or not you would like your name
and address being published. When we have received a reasonable number of
these back then we will publish those that have agreed. This system was only
started recently, and at the time of typing this we have had 54 of these
resubscriptions back. The response looks very favourable, with 42 people
ticking &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; and only 9 ticking &lsquo;No&rsquo;. I really don&rsquo;t know what to do with
the 3 that didn&rsquo;t tick either!

<h3>
Advertising
</h3>
<p>
In one communication received recently there was a comment along the
lines of &ldquo;If Gemini think that 80-BUS is so wonderful, why don&rsquo;t they support
the magazine that is dedicated to 80-BUS by advertising in 80-BUS News?&rdquo;.
This made me realise that you non-subscribers don&rsquo;t realise that you are
missing out!! Several times in the past, and again with this issue, Gemini
have included various catalogues and data sheets with the subscription
mailings. In addition the recent Questionnaire only went in with the
subscription issues, apart from a few that were left over and that were
therefore sent to one dealer. So remember, if you&rsquo;re not a fully paid up
subscriber you may be missing vital information and opportunities!

<h3>
Front covers
</h3>
<p>
I ought here to belatedly thank Alf for his work. Alf has been
responsible for drawing the front covers on the last few mags, and in my
opinion he has made an excellent job of them. In Vol.3 <a href="../text/"></a>Issue&nbsp;3 I asked if
anyone could understand its front cover. Well ONE person responded, on his
Questionnaire (and unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t been able to find it in the pile
again), and got it right. Well done sir. The answer?? Well the
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
has the ability of supporting a serial (cereal) keyboard!! (Yes, Alf may get 10 for
quality, but only 2 for content!!)
