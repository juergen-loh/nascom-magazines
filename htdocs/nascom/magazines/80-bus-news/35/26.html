Description.
</p>
<p>
Input locator. This function serves as the interface between GSX and the
outside world. Typically this will call the digitiser or mouse to return
information on its whereabouts. When in request mode a cursor will appear
on the screen and move according to the action of the specified input
device. When in sample mode the current locator position is immediately
returned and is often used in conjunction with ESCAPE 18 to plot a
graphics cursor while at the same time displaying a rubber banding line.
</p>
<p>
Inquire input valuator. If some sort of analogue device is connected to
the workstation, then the current value of its status is returned. Could
be of use if graphical displays of external monitoring devices is
required.
</p>
<p>
Inquire choice device. The choice device may be something like a keypad
or function keys. For use in menu driven applications I would imagine.
</p>
<p>
String device. This returns a string from an input device which will of
course be the keyboard in most cases.
</p>
<p>
Set writing mode. This affects the way in which lines or filled areas
etc. are placed on the screen. The modes available are replace,
overstrike, complement (XOR) and erase.
</p>
<p>
Set input mode. This lets you specify the type of input device you will
require next i.e. locator, valuator, choice or string. You have also to
specify whether this device is to operate in request or sample mode. In
request mode the device waits until an event occurs such as the digitiser
pen being pressed down to terminate input, in sample mode the current
status or location of the device is returned without waiting.
