This program is for making a listing on a printer of all the file names
on a Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM809","",""); ?>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?><?php externalLink("GM815"); ?>
system with Polydos 2.0. The output consists of a
listing of file names as they appear on the disks and a sorted list of file
names, as well as a usage summary of all the user disks owned. For this to
work properly the user must have some way of identifying his disks, I have
decided to use the last two digits of the twenty digit disk name (see the
FORMAT utility or the NAME command).

<p>
Another way of obtaining a list is to use the DIR;ELD command but this
takes a long time for a large number of disks and does not give a sorted
listing and a summary. With only a few disks it is quite easy to remember
where things are kept, this becomes increasingly more difficult as the number
of disks increases. (Also I have a remarkably bad memory).

The following is a sample output from running this program against two
disks the first disk has an identifier D2 and the second B2:&ndash;
