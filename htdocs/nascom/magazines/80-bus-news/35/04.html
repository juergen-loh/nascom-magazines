<p>
I am a Nascom&nbsp;2, Gemini 64K RAM card,
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
FDC and Gemini
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
user. I
am running CP/M&nbsp;2.2 with Pertec FD250 drives.
</p>
<p>
I purchased surplus Pertec drives from the USA and had lots of problems.
All the problems were a result of leaky decoupling capacitors. For those of
you who intend to purchase surplus FD250, I suggest that all the decoupling
capacitors should be replaced. Other than this, the drives are great.
</p>
<p>
There is a simple hardware and software modification to get these drives
reading and writing 40 tracks instead of 35 tracks. Though I have done this
independently, I understand &ldquo;Henry&rsquo;s&rdquo; is offering this modification. For
those of you who are interested, please write and I will send full details.
</p>
<p>
Those of you who intend to make the printer-buffer as published in the
June 1984 issue of BYTE, please note that the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> output of the Nascom&nbsp;2 or
Gemini should be buffered and properly oriented with pull up resistors before
it will work. I assume that the readers will have taken care of the other
errors in the buffer hardware and software as published by BYTE
</p>
<p>
All correspondence on the above and other Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini subjects
welcomed.

<u>Further thoughts on Hisoft Pascal</u>
</h3>
<p>
Following on from the
<a href="../../../34/11/text/#article1">random musings of Dr. Dark</a>
in the issue of July-August
1984, I am writing to tell of some procedures developed for just this
need. The CP/M manual describes a file control block (FCB) which is used for
random access, but this is not allowed for in the standard <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal file
handler &ndash; the Pascal one is three bytes too short. So we want a definition of
a FCB which can be used for random access, like this&nbsp;&ndash;

<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-04-1.png"); ?>
<p>
The other definitions of types and variables must be placed in the
program as needed. The most important of these is a buffer area to store the
record read from the file or about to be written to it. The simplest of
