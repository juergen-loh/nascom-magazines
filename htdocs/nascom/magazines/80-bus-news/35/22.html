I will now try and explain the technicalities of working with GSX. These
will be clarified with the aid of diagrams (a picture&rsquo;s worth etc), as is does
seem rather complex at first. It is worth mentioning that once you, as the
applications or device driver writer, have created a routine that allows you
to easily reference the data arrays concerned, the task is not quite so
daunting as it first seems.
</p>
<p>
As calls to the BDOS involve the use of the BC and DE register to inform
of your intentions, the problem is how do you manage to pass sometimes large
amounts of data over using only one 16 bit value. Of course the answer is with
the use of pointers as usual. Don&rsquo;t forget that the C register contains 115 on
all calls to GDOS regardless and therefore cannot be used for pointer work.
</p>
<p>
The GSX standard expects the application programmer to have set up 5
arrays, and to give them their proper names, these are:
</p>
<h3>
PARAMETER BLOCK
</h3>
<p>
This 5x16 bit array contains the start addresses of the other data arrays
described below. On a call to GDOS the DE register pair must contain the start
address of this array.
