But be warned, MBASIC starts it&rsquo;s workspace and stack from the top of the
TPA. The stack and/or workspace could come crashing through the program if
you&rsquo;re not careful. So POKEing this into RAM in MBASIC is not a clever idea.
Far sneakier is a method suggested by Carl Lloyd-Parker, and that makes use of
the fact that although MBASIC knows where strings are in a program, it doesn&rsquo;t
pull then out into the workspace area until some additive or subtractive
manuipulation is carried out on it. In other words, the string stays where it
was originally written in the program unless you do something nasty to it.
Carl&rsquo;s method is to define a string of asterisks somewhere in the program, the
string being as long as the machine code to be POKEd into it. Then calculate
the position of the string using VARPTR, then POKE the code into the string as
the example above. The address calculated from VARPTR is also the call address
for the program. There are two examples of this, one by Carl in his IVC HIRES
programs and another by me in the BASIC demo CLOCK program in the Gemini GM816
manual. The fun part of this method is if the string is placed as the first
line of the program, then, when the program has been run, the string is full
of lots of interesting junk, making the program unlistable (if you start the
list at the first line).

Perhaps you&rsquo;re wondering how I decimalize the HEX code from the programs
as assembled into a form useable by dBASE or MBASIC, or whatever, at least
without making too many mistakes. Simple I use BASIC to do it! First I
assemble the program using M80 and L80 as usual, then I load it up under ZSID,
DDT, GEM-DEBUG or some other debugger. I then clear out the memory around the
location where the program is to reside and move the program to the working
address. This gives me the program in memory at its correct place with some
00h&rsquo;s before and after it. (Nice and identifiable that way.)

Next into MBASIC, work out the start and end addresses using the &amp;H
function in BASIC, note that this gives negative answers if not treated right.
Take the instance above:
</p>
<pre>
? 65536 + &amp;Hc000
49152
Ok
? 65536 + &amp;Hc011
49169
Ok
</pre>
<p class="noindent">
Now for the crafty bit, open a sequential file and write the code to it, I do
this in the command mode like so:
</p>
<pre>
OPEN "0",&pound;1,"CODE": FOR A=49152 TO 49169: PRINT&pound;1,PEEK(A);: NEXT: CLOSE
</pre>
<p class="noindent">
Surpise surpise, this gives me an ASCII file that I can bash into a text
editor and edit to suit. My favourite address for machine code to be used in
this way is c000h, as for some reason I can always remember 49152. When it
comes to the end addresses of these programs, having calculated it I usually
have a quick PEEK around the calculated address to see if I got right, hence
the nulls either end of the program. The whole process takes about as long as
it took to write up and being done by machine is not susceptible to human
error.
