Referring to the last item, it seems that most members of the 80-BUS
fraternity will have to stop and think at this point. &ldquo;I now have GSX, but
what about the device drivers for MY system?&rdquo; Well you have a choice of two
options, the first being to write your own device driver or secondly, wait for
the one you want to be released.
</p>
<p>
Writing your own does seem to defeat the object of the exercise, doesn&rsquo;t
it? However it is possible, you are able to implement as much or as little of
the standard as you wish depending on the capabilities of the device. A word
of warning here. The device driver specifications supplied with the GSX disk
are attractivly bound and the contents well laid out, but trying to write a
GSX device driver from the knowledge contained therein should not be attempted
unless you are sure of your sanity and/or you have a hot line to Digital
Research in Newbury. During the creation of the Gemini device driver for the
Pluto board I have needed to refer to both the GSX80 and GSX86 manuals for
information, the GSX86 one being by far the better of the two. Test software
is yet another problem, as writing your own will not confirm that you have got
it right. All testing for the Pluto driver so far has been done using the DR
DRAW drawing package, a fine piece of software, but it will cost you &pound;232 at
current retail prices. The DR compiled BASIC, CBASIC, will also help you as it
contains inbuilt commands that allow you access to GSX, and you will find
yourself &pound;393 the poorer for this experience. So in a nutshell, unless you are
sure that you are committed to the subject it might be better if you waited
for your device driver to appear on the scene.
</p>
<p>
But will they arrive? Well Gemini will soon be releasing a device driver
for the popular Pluto board that will be configurable for the 640 and 768
versions in both high and low res. Input routines have been written for
keyboard, digitiser and mouse, and seperate drivers may be supplied for each
of these devices. They also have a driver for their GM837 colour card under
development though no release date can be forecast for this just yet. As far
as other devices are concerned, who knows, but I suppose if the demand is
there others will appear.
</p>
<p>
So how does it work? Lets first take the source program that you yourself
will write. You forget all about the target display machine and its
limitations, frame size, aspect ratio etc, as GSX will sort all that out for
you. This concept means that your program is capable of being displayed on any
graphics device for which you have a GSX device driver. You have at your
disposal up to 33 graphical routines depending on the particular device driver
you have installed, these include old favourites such as line drawing and text
display, along with extra goodies like complex polygon fills that will cater
for a number of fill patterns. Each GSX function is invoked by a special call
to the BDOS (115 in C register). All the data associated with a function call
will have been stored in special arrays of your own creation and their start
addresses passed across using the GDOS parameter passing conventions. (This is
where GSX starts getting a little complex &ndash; but more on this later.)
</p>
<p>
The 32767 X 32767 virtual frame size means that you can afford to be
lavish with your coordinates and even include some form of zoom feature in
your emerging bijou of a program, providing that those around you don&rsquo;t take
offence at the constant stream of expletives and apparent recurrence of brain
death associated with such activities.
