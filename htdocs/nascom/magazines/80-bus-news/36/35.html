Stimulated by
<a href="../../../32/17/text/#article1">Dr Dark&rsquo;s suggestion</a>
in the March-April 1984 issue (Vol&nbsp;3 Issue&nbsp;2) I decided to rake out this program, first written in January, and
submit it for publication.
</p>
<p>
The Spectrum is a remarkable little machine, but most of the interesting
games available are in machine code, and difficult to patch (i.e. cheat!)
without decent tools. I was too mean to buy a machine code package and a
printer interface for my son&rsquo;s Spectrum, having perfectly good facilities on
the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>, and I decided to interface the Spectrum to my <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> without
using any extra hardware so that I could disassemble, list, and generally
tinker with code dumped from the Spectrum.
</p>
<p>
The Spectrum uses one of its ports (0FEH) for output to the MIC socket
and to provide the Border colours on the screen, bit 3 for the MIC and bits 0-2
for the three primary colours. Its built-in tape routines use a non-standard
format, but it is possible to use the output bit provided in any format you
wish, in this case the CUTS standard used in the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>, which outputs 1 cycle
at 1200 Hz for a zero bit, and 2 cycles at 2400 Hz for a non-zero bit when it
is set up for 1200&nbsp;Baud output. I used 300&nbsp;Baud values (4 cycles and 8 cycles)
initially, but found that 1200&nbsp;Baud was more reliable!
</p>
<p>
The crucial routine in the program is labelled SndBit; each bit to be
output to tape is passed to this routine in the carry flag, and the MIC bit in
port FE is toggled accordingly, with appropriate delays for the frequencies
involved. The initial counts for the delay loops have to be calculated from
the known clock frequency of the Spectrum and the number of T-states used by
each instruction, and are included in the EQUates at the beginning of the
listing.
</p>
<p>
SndBit may be regarded as a software emulation of the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>&rsquo;s cassette
interface, and is sent data bytewise by the UART emulator routine BytOut,
which is in turn fed by the NAS-SYS &ldquo;Write&rdquo; emulator routine, which is the
bulk of the remainder of the program. The analogy is not complete, in that the
<span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> hardware is continuously sending out a stop bit when the cassette
output is not in use. The loop labelled PL0 is used to provide a short burst
of this &ldquo;pilot tone&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
For convenience, the start and end+1 addresses are passed to the program
at 8000 and 8002 (ie 32768 and 32770) and the program itself runs at 8004
(RANDOMIZE USR 32772). I use a second copy assembled at F000 if code in the
range 8000 to 80C0 is of interest. You may wish to write a short BASIC program
to prompt for the necessary addresses and remind you to start the tape, but
remember that this may encroach on code under examination.
</p>
<p>
The output follows exactly the format of a &ldquo;W XXXX YYYY&rdquo; command under
NAS-SYS with all the usual checksums, and may be saved on cassette and then
loaded directly into memory on the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> using the &ldquo;R&rdquo; command. If NAS-SYS&nbsp;3
is available, it may be loaded at any address by giving the appropriate offset
as an argument. With suitable amplification it may be connected directly into
the tape input on the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="uppercase">Important Note</span>: This program will not operate properly at addresses below
8000 because the Video circuitry is constantly reading this block of RAM, and
upsets the timing loops. As the Spectrum keyboard is read under interrupt,
this must also be disabled while the program is run (and enabled afterwards of
course!).
</p>
<p>
I have also written code using similar techniques which uses the Spectrum
LLIST and LPRINT commands to speak to the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> through the cassette
interface, using the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> as a printer buffer to my Epson. It doesn&rsquo;t handle
screen dumps yet, but one of these wet Sundays&hellip;
