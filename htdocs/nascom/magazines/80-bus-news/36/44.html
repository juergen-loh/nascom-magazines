additional hardware is used, and in any case both CP/M and NAS=-SYS use page
one of memory, which is where the -RST&rsquo; locations are operative. Assuming a
vector can be generated, there is still the problem of where to allow
interrupts to be active within the program. It would be necessary to use EI
and DI instructions carefully, avoiding the whole of the CCP and BDOS areas,
</p>
<p>
and most of the CBIOS. The area diminishes until one is left with a few I/O-areas
such as the Keyboard. Fortunately this conclusion greatly simplifies the
task, because computers spend nearly the whole time waiting for keyboard
input.
</p>
<p>
There are occasions when the machine is not awaiting Keyboard input, as
during Disk I/O, Formatting text, Compiling or Assembling a Source File, or
perhaps copying files. Some of these activities can last for a few minutes. If
one is content to allow the clock display to -freeze&rdquo; for these few times, but
update regularly at all other times, then the solution to the problem becomes
much simpler. The difficulty of implementing interrupts has been mentioned.
Since clock updating is restricted to such a -small* area of the program, in
terms of code, then there is no real advantage in using Interrupts, and
Polling will give the required performance.
</p>
<p>
The method that I have used is therefore based on integrating the clock
&ldquo;polling&rdquo; code into the keyboard scan code.
</p>
<p>
A number of short listings of source code are given. These show in full
the extra code that I have added to SYS vers. 16. to permit conditional
assembly for the Clock with options for a couple of extra features. Any code
shown in lower case is -SYS* code, included to show the position of my
additions, while Upper case code is my added code. (Except for the -headings&rdquo;
enclosed in &ldquo;*&rdquo; characters.) Modification for other SYS8&rsquo;s or the Gemini BIOSs
should also be relatively easy, if the Source Code is to hand. In the example
Listings in this article, it is assumed that the system is using a keyboard
attached to the Gemini GM812 IVC card, and that the RTC chip is addressed as
16 Ports from address 20H, as on the Gemini GM816 card. Modification of the
clock software for PIO format should be along the lines of previous articles
in the 80-BUS News, and other magazines. I have not looked at the problems
that might arise in outputting the Clock to a NASCOM format screen. If a
NASCOM keyboard is used the clock code can probably be fitted into that area,
but I have not tried this method.
</p>
<p>
Code extract 1 lists additional &lsquo;-EQU&rsquo;ates that need to be inserted into
module one of SYS. If CLOCK is not true, then all clock related code will be
omitted in subsequent modules. If Clock is TRUE, then all related clock
routines will be included in the assembly. Setting LOCK to TRUE will cause
code to be included into the WARM BOOT routines that will -lock&rdquo; the top line
of the IVC screen display. This will stop the clock display from scrolling
-through the top&rsquo; of the screen. I usually have both NASCOM and Gemini
keyboards on my machine, but the RTC code in this article is relevant to the
keyboard on the IVC only.
</p>
<p>
Some of the clock code is a straight copy of the examples given in the
GM816 manual and I make no claim as to its originality. The variable NMRREG is
set to the number of RTC registers that are to be read. The variable OFFSET
can be chosen such that the Clock display on the Screen is updated every 1
Sec., 10 Sec,. or 1 Minute as desired. The RTC chip is of course updating its
own registers every &ndash;1 Second. There is only about 10 Bytes left in SYS at
