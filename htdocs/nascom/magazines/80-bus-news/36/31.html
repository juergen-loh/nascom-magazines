Here we have declared a hundred byte array (0 &ndash; 99) and set up a
character pointer to the start of it. -&amp;arrayx[0]&rsquo; is the syntax used to
return the address of array[0] which is then placed into the pointer -point&rsquo;.
For -C&rsquo; fans everywhere that have noticed that I could have achieved the same
by saying -point = arrayx;&rsquo;, fear not, I realise this but it is a good example
of -C&rsquo;s addressing capability.
</p>
<p>
Pointers to functions are also available and are useful in applications
that require overlay sections. Executable code is read into an area of memory
with a known base address and using function pointers control is passed to it.
You are also capable of passing arguments to this function if required.

&ldquo;C* functions

<p>
&ldquo;nain() is the name given to the controlling function of any program and
always recieves control when the program is entered. Of course you can do what
you like as soon as you have entered main, but devotees of structured
programming will realise that this is where the controlling calls of the
overall program should reside.
</p>
<p>
In main of the first sample program you can see that 4 functions have
been called, namely openit, wrt_nums, printf and exit. You can see where the
first two come from, they are in the source listing, but what about the
others? Well it may come as a bit of a shock but -C&rdquo; contains no 10 capability
of its own, there are no intrinsic functions such as in BASIC or FORTRAN. What
this means is that if you compiled this program as it stands into a&nbsp;.COM file
the linker would declare printf, exit, fopen, fclose, and putw as undefined.
Pretty useless on its own eh? But this is where -C&rsquo; wins over its rivals in
some respects. The functions such as printf, which is capable of displaying a
formatted string on the screen, have to be loaded from function libraries
supplied to you in REL format on your master disk. The required code is
extracted from these libraries by using the L80 /s option for example and
linked into your program. This means that the runnable program contains only
the code necessary and no unused portions.
</p>
<p>
These function libraries are usually pretty extensive and contain not
only the routines defined by the -C&rdquo; standard but also some which have been
added by the compiler writers to make your life easier. You will have guessed
from this that you are also able to create your own libraries and place them
into your programs in a similar fashion. I have in the course of my duties at
Gemini created function libraries for both the SVC and Pluto which are written
in assembler.
</p>
<p>
As a point of interest the -C&rdquo; standard dictates that arguments passed to
a function are pushed onto the stack in reverse order before the function is
called. The value of the argument is pushed and not the address of the
variable ie. pass by value. So from within your custom written assembler
routine you can retrieve these values from the stack and send them out to your
SVC or Pluto as data using the Z80 OUT opcode. In practice though, I have
noticed that the ECO C compiler only passes integer and character arguments by
value and any arguments longer than 2 bytes are passed by address. There are
often idiosyncracies involved with the method by which arguments are passed so
I&rsquo;m afraid that there is no substitute for reading the manual.
