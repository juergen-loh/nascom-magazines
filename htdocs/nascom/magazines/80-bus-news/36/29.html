The file STDIO.H is supplied with a compiler and is &lsquo;included&rsquo; at the
beginning of most programs that require IO capabilities. It is itself &lsquo;C&rsquo;
source code and it declares items to the program such as file control blocks
and IO buffers that will be used later on. It also declares things like &lsquo;NULL&rsquo;
which can be seen in openit, this is analagous to the M80 equates that are
seen at the beginning of a program. Examples from stdio.h are typically:
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(3); ?>
<?php columnChange(23); ?>
<pre class="indent">
&pound;define NULL 0
&pound;define TRUE 1
&pound;define FALSE 0
</pre>
<?php columnEnd(3); ?>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<p>
You can also use the &pound;define facility to define equates of your own in
the identical way. The &lsquo;C&rsquo; macro preprocessor that most compilers have looks
through your code and replaces all occurrences of &lsquo;NULL&rsquo; with &lsquo;0&rsquo; and so on.
&pound;define entries can also be used for inserting macros into your code.

<h3>
&lsquo;C&rsquo; data types
</h3>
<p>
The next two lines declare permanent storage for the variables &lsquo;count&rsquo;
and &lsquo;fd&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t worry about the &lsquo;*&rsquo; in front of the &lsquo;fd&rsquo; it means that it is
an integer pointer, more on that later. These variables defined in this way
outside of any functions declare then as global to all functions in this
source file and also to any modules that are to be linked in later. Being
globals they will reside in memory and maintain their set values throughout
the run of the program. They may be accessed and altered by any of the program
functions.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;C&rsquo; also allows you to use local or, to give them their proper name,
automatic variables, these are declared inside the body of a function and
reside in the stack area until a return from the function occurs. Automatic
variables are declared as follows.
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(3); ?>
<?php columnChange(23); ?>
<pre class="indent">
functionx()
{
int var_a, var_b;
char array[16];
</pre>
<?php columnEnd(3); ?>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<p>
The above declares two 16 bit integers and an array of 16 bytes in the
stack area. So you can see that you are able to create space for storage and
arrays that you can process inside a function, store a result and discard on
exit. Once the function has done its stuff the stack pointer is restored to
its previous value before the routine was called and the stack space made
available for other uses.
</p>
<p>
The data types available to you sometimes depend upon the compiler that
you have but a typical &lsquo;C&rsquo; compiler will have the following types.
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>short or char</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>These usually occupy a single byte.</td></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Integer data type, usually two bytes long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>long</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Long integer, usually four bytes long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>float</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Single precision FP variable usually 4 bytes long.</td></tr>
<tr><td>double</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Double precision FP usually 8 bytes long.</td></tr>
</table>
