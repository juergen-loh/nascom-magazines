I do not intend to give a detailed description of the language here as it
would be too long and boring but if I can try to conjure up the flavour of
&ldquo;The -C&rsquo; programming environment&rdquo; as the yanks call it, I think that would
serve my purpose better. If by some miracle these documented mumblings
generate some enthusiasm then I recommend that you go out and buy the standard
text book for any -C&rdquo; programmer, that is &ldquo;The -c&rsquo; programming language&rdquo; by
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published by Prentice-Hall. It is quite
good for a computing textbook, and what is more, defines the standard to which
all compiler writers strive, and all available compilers are compared. Better
still borrow it from a friend as it probably costs about &pound;19 by now.
</p>
<p>
Ok, enough of the preamble, lets get our hands dirty and walz straight
into a *C&rsquo; program. This will not shock the computing world with its
complexity but is a program to open a disk file and write the value of a loop
counter into it.
</p>
<p>
8include &ldquo;stdio.h&rdquo; /* include standard I0 header file
fron disk */
</p>
<p>
int count; /* declare a 16 bit integervbl */
FILE *fd; /* declare file descriptor */
main()
printf("A -C* program\n"); /* print opening message */
openit(); /* call function to open file */
wrt_nums(); /* call function to write to file*/
printf&pound;("Program terminating\n"); /* print end message */
fclose( fd); /* weite buffers &amp; close file */
exit(0); /* call exit routine */
}
openit() /* function to open trivia file */
{
fd=fopen("A: TRIVIA. DAT&rdquo; ,"w") ; /* pass name &amp; mode to fopen func*/
printf("Trivia file: &ldquo;); /* display file id */
if(fd == NULL) /* is the file open sucessful */
{
printf("open error"); /* No &ndash; so print error message */
exit(0); /* ... and terminate program */
}
else printf("open ok\n"); /* file opened ok, so tell em */
}
wrt_nums() /* writes value of count to disk */
{
</p>
<p>
for(count=0; count&lt;=100; count++) putw(count, fd);
</p>
<p>
}
</p>
<p>
So having looked at it what do you think, I know that I have been using
-c&rsquo; for a while now and I&rsquo;m pretty used to it, but is it really as mumbo
jumbo&rsquo;ish as some people say?
