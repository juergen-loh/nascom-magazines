I do not intend to give a detailed description of the language here as it
would be too long and boring but if I can try to conjure up the flavour of
&ldquo;The &lsquo;C&rsquo; programming environment&rdquo; as the yanks call it, I think that would
serve my purpose better. If by some miracle these documented mumblings
generate some enthusiasm then I recommend that you go out and buy the standard
text book for any &lsquo;C&rsquo; programmer, that is &ldquo;The &lsquo;C&rsquo; programming language&rdquo; by
Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published by Prentice-Hall. It is quite
good for a computing textbook, and what is more, defines the standard to which
all compiler writers strive, and all available compilers are compared. Better
still borrow it from a friend as it probably costs about &pound;19 by now.

Ok, enough of the preamble, lets get our hands dirty and walz straight
into a &lsquo;C&rsquo; program. This will not shock the computing world with its
complexity but is a program to open a disk file and write the value of a loop
counter into it.

So having looked at it what do you think, I know that I have been using
&lsquo;C&rsquo; for a while now and I&rsquo;m pretty used to it, but is it really as mumbo
jumbo&rsquo;ish as some people say?
