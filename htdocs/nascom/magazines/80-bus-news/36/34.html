It is probably this sort of thing that causes so much confusion to the
non initiated as experienced -C&rsquo; programmers prefer to use the shorthand as it
is easier to type in, but doesn&rsquo;t do much for the clarity of the source code.

<p>
The -C&rdquo; programming environment
</p>
<p>
As you can see it can be used at many levels depending on the application
in hand. If it is tight assembler like code that you require, you can develop
a whole program using bit fields and logical operators, never once calling on
one of the library functions. If however you wish it to be a higher level
language all the facilities are there for you to use.
</p>
<p>
You may find that some of the supplied functions are not to your liking.
For example the inclusion of the standard printf function from a library tends
to add 4k onto the program even if it was only a simple message. If this does
not suit you then all you have to do is write your own with less formatting
capability and so less memory required.
</p>
<p>
This ability to create libraries of functions that can easily be linked
in the final version adds to your programming capability. As you develop you
will aquire libraries that suit your applications and programming style and
perhaps discard the standard libraries altogether. As mentioned I have created
a library of Pluto functions and with these I have in effect a high level
Pluto programming language. If you were to look at a Pluto program you would
barely recognise it as -C&ldquo; at all, as it consists of calls to my custom
written routines. This must be the biggest advantage in that you mould the
language to suit yourself.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, there it is, I was hoping to include a section on compilers, what
is available and how they work, but I think that I will save that for the next
issue (If I ever get invited to write again), besides I must get back to my
novelette or I&rsquo;ll never get that house in Palm Beach California.
