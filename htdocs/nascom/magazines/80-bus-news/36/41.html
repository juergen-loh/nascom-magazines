Recently, while debugging a new board for my beloved Nascom&nbsp;2, I needed
to test the outputs of some chips in a manner that really required a logic
probe. As the cheapest probe I could find was a &pound;12 kit in an old Technomatic
catalogue, and there was no way I would spend that kind of money if I could
help it, I set about designing my own.

<p>
Now, I don&rsquo;t know what they mean by all the &ldquo;pulse train&rdquo; stuff that they
go on about in adverts, but my little probe costing 70p (roughly) has seen
extensive use, and done everything that I have needed it to.
</p>
<p>
The probe has a display of three LEDs, which are used to show a high
logic level, a low logic level, and a pulse. A single pulse (e.g. the /RESET
line) will cause the &ldquo;pulsing&rdquo; LED to light for about a quarter of a second.
A series of pulses (e.g. the CLOCK line) will cause the LED to light brightly.
This gives a far clearer indication of what&rsquo;s going on, than trying to judge
the brightness of a dimly lit LED.

I constructed my probe on a piece of vero-board, about 25 holes by 10
holes (2.5 inches by 1 inch), as this is a reasonable size to hold in the
hand. The three LEDs were mounted at one end, in a line with the &ldquo;pulsing&rdquo;
LED in the middle. At the other end I put the actual &lsquo;probe&rsquo;. This was simply
a piece of single core wire, threaded through the vero-board a couple of
times, to make it stick out in a suitably probe-like manner. Power leads are
about 18 inches long, as this allows sufficient length to reach anywhere on my
computer, and twisted together for convenience. Be certain to put a
