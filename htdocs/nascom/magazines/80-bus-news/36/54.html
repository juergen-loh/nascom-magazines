<h4>
<span class="uppercase">The Gateway</span>
</h4>
<p>
The author of the highly successful NASPEN and
<span class="uppercase">Diskpen</span> software has now completed his latest
masterpiece. Called the <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span>, this represents a new
concept in database management. The aim is to provide
free access to information rather than data restricted
within the more normal rigidly defined fields of a
conventional database. Designed primarily for use with
ASCII text files from any source, the <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span> works in a
free field format, allowing the <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span> to search for
logical references from single word length to references
contained within text blocks of any size from sentences,
paragraphs, etc, with a practical limit of about 20,000
characters (about 5 pages of closely typed A4) per
field. <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span> searches and constructs &lsquo;tag&rsquo; lists which
contain pointers matches found, and then allows storing,
merging, printing or copying of the references found.
</p>
<h4>
<span class="uppercase">The Pathway</span>
</h4>
<p>
The output from the <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span> can be handled by any
text processor, but the <span class="uppercase">Pathway</span> text formatting program
offers significant advantages as it is designed to make
use of the output of the <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span> to produce reports,
mail shots {complete with mail merging facility), etc. A
unique feature is the ability to configure both the
input and output formats, where any input character may
be converted and similarly any output character can be
converted into a different character or string.
</p>
<p>
Both <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span> and <span class="uppercase">Pathway</span> are system independant
programs, and will run on any CP/M80 machine.
</p>
<p>
The unique flexibility and power of <span class="uppercase">Gateway</span> and
<span class="uppercase">Pathway</span> is difficult to describe in this restricted
space. The complete manuals are available separately and
the cost will be credited against the purchase of the
suite.

<h4>
<span class="uppercase">Super Diskpen</span> (Version PENYG:3)
</h4>
<p>
<span class="uppercase">Diskpen</span> has been rewritten and revised. This
popular text editor/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>formatter now includes a &ldquo;HELP!
facility, and new features for the print control of the
most popular printers, underline, bold, etc {also
user patchable for the less popular types). New
features include block delete, better move commands,
new cursor control, optional hyphenation, visible
indentation setting and lots more. A major enhancement
is the ability to handle overlay files so that PEN can
use auxilliary packages such as the <span class="uppercase">Maxifile</span> free
field file searching utility or the print spooling
utility.
</p>
<p>
The new <span class="uppercase">Diskpen</span> is useable on all Gemini
multiboard computers (Galaxy, Kenilworth, Quantum)
and Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini hybrids, (MAPPEN is available for
users of the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 VFC","MAP video card",""); ?>).
<span class="uppercase">Diskpen</span> is available as an
upgrade to earlier DISKPENs and GEMPENs at 17.25
inc. VAT., or to new purchasers at 57.50 inc. VAT.

<h4>
BDOSZ
</h4>
<p>
Yes, you guessed it. Some enterprising person
has now &lsquo;disconbooberated&rsquo; the BDOS in CP/M and
rewritten it as a Z80 program. Its fully compatible with
the original with no bugs found to date. Because it&rsquo;s
written in Z80 code it&rsquo;s smaller, this has allowed
room for tidying up all the annoying stupids in the
original BDOS so that errors like:
</p>
<pre>
BDOS ERROR ON x: R/O
</pre>
<p class="continued">
which usually causes you to lose everything you&rsquo;ve
just done, becomes the far more helpful:
</p>
<pre>
Disk x: is set R/O
Do it anyway? (Y/N/^C)
</pre>
<p class="continued">
Which, of course, means you don&rsquo;t lose anything. It even
allows you to change disks when they are full without
loss of data. In all, a lovely piece of software.
Available in most popular 5.25&Prime; formats (please state
when ordering) at 11.50 inc. VAT.

GEC LTU-11 75/1200&nbsp;Baud Modem Kit
</h4>
<p>
The GEC LTU-11 75&nbsp;BAUD transmit/1200&nbsp;Baud receive
modem kit consists of two components, the modem card and
the direct telephone coupler. The modem card accepts I/O
at TTL levels at 75&nbsp;BAUD and returns data at TTL levels
at 1200&nbsp;BAUD. The modem card produces the necessary
modem tones which are fed to the direct coupler. The
coupler consists of the line isolation transformer which
sends and receives the modem tones and has TTL level
inputs for the control relays for line seize and autodial.
Power supplies are +5&nbsp;volts and &minus;5&nbsp;volts. The
units originally had BT approval, but as these are
supplied in kit form, the BT approval is void. Supplied
complete with connection data and auto-dial software.
GEC LTU-11 modem card 14.95 inc. VAT. (13.00 + VAT).
