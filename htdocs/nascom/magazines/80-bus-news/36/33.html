default routine is executed, in this case the output of an error message and
the setting of an error flag.

Now we have introduced the &lsquo;break&rsquo; statement, I think that we should give
it a further airing along with its bedmate the &lsquo;continue&rsquo; statement. Although
&lsquo;C&rsquo; allows the use of the &lsquo;goto&rsquo; statement, it should never be necessary to
use it. Let us say that we are in the body of an executing loop and we come
across the following:
</p>
<pre class="center">
if( vbll_1 == 0 ) break;
</pre>
<p>
vbl_1 is tested for a zero value and if it is found to be true the loop
is exited and control is passed to the statement immediatly following the loop
statements. A nice clean way don&rsquo;t you think to conditionally exit an
executing loop.
</p>
<p>
if the following was encountered:
</p>
<pre class="center">
if( vbl_1 == 0 ) continue;
</pre>
<p>
&lsquo;C&rsquo; would interpret this as, if vbl_1 is found to be 0 then forget about
the remainder of the looping statements and continue with the next iteration.
This is not an exit from the loop but the forcing of a premature &lsquo;NEXT&rsquo;, to
give a comparison in BASIC.
</p>
<p>
It did occur to me a while back that if you used &lsquo;&pound;define goto
structured_repass&rsquo; the preprocessor would replace &lsquo;structured_repass&rsquo; with
goto, which means that you could have as many goto&rsquo;s in your code as you
wanted and no one would be any the wiser, especially if you put it in STDIO.H
where it could not be found in a source listing. If you want to get your own
back, using methods like that, &lsquo;C&rsquo; could be the ideal medium for &lsquo;drop
through&rsquo; spaghetti programmers!

<h3>
<u>Arithmetic operators</u>
</h3>
<p>
All the normal operators are supported and usually conform to the
standard rules of operator precedence. As you may have already noticed there
are two ways that arithmetic syntax can be entered. I call these &lsquo;longhand&rsquo;
and &lsquo;shorthand&rsquo; for convenience. Here is some equivalent syntax.
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>longhand</th><th>shorthand</th><th>desc</th></tr>
<tr><td>x=x+1</td><td>x++</td><td>increments x by 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>x=x+3</td><td>X+=3</td><td>increments x by 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>x=x*3</td><td>x*=3</td><td>multiplies x by 3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In addition to these you will also have bitwise logical operators at your
beck and call, some examples below.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>x&gt;&gt;=4</td><td>shifts x four bits to the right</td></tr>
<tr><td>x&lt;&lt;=6</td><td>shifts x six bits to the left</td></tr>
</table>
