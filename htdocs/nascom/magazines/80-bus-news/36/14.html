and A13 (also A14 for future expansion), control lines /OE, PGM and /PGM, and
power supplies Vcc (+5V), Vpp (+21V and +25V) and GND (0V) are taken to a 16-pin
dil socket. ZIF socket connections that vary depending on the EPROM being
used are also taken to this socket. By inserting a header plug with the
required connections the appropriate EPROM may be programmed. See fig&nbsp;2 for
header connections. Note that some EPROMS require a low to high programming
pulse whereas others require a high to low pulse &ndash; hence the use of two
signals PGM and /PGM respectively.

The +5V supply is provided by a 7805 5V regulator from an unregulated 30V
supply. The two Vpp voltages are supplied from two separate circuits built
around two 723 regulators. Although the 723 can deliver the 30ma Vpp current I
included a bypass transistor to take most of the dissipation away from the
723. The function switch has 3 positions&ndash; OFF, READ (Vcc and Vpp at +5V) and
<span class="uppercase">Program</span> (Vcc at +5V and Vpp at +21 and +25V). Two LEDs indicate when Vpp
and/or Vcc is applied. The 5.1V zener stops the Vpp LED lighting when in READ
mode (Vpp=+5v).

<h3>
<u>Control Program</u>
</h3>
<p>
By restricting the EPROM types that can be programmed, and routing the
signals via the header socket, the control program has been made very
straightforward and, apart from checking to see if a 2532 is being programmed,
it does not really need to know which EPROM is in the socket since the
routines and control signals are the same. However, for convenience of the
user you are requested to enter the EPROM type so you will be told if you are
trying to program a 4K block of memory into a <?php externalLink("2716","",""); ?>! It also uses the EPROM
type information to work out the number of locations to check for erasure and
to read in the EPROM contents to RAM.
</p>
<p>
On entering the program a menu gives the options:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="indent2">
<li>Verify EPROM fully erased</li>
<li>Read in EPROM to memory</li>
<li>Program EPROM (and verify)</li>
<li>Return to NAS-SYS</li>
</ol>
<p>
The basic structure of each operation is a simple loop which outputs an
address, sets the control lines to perform the operation, either writes data
from RAM to the EPROM or reads data from the EPROM into RAM, increments the
EPROM address and RAM pointer, and continues until the operation is complete.
In each case you will first be asked to enter the EPROM type. The previously
entered type is displayed and if this does not need to be changed just press
<span class="uppercase">Newline</span>.
</p>
<h4>
1. Verify
</h4>
<p>
This routine reads in every location from the EPROM and compares it with
FFh which signifies that it is erased. If the location is not erased, a
message is displayed together with the address of the offending location. If
there are a lot of unerased locations you can press ESCAPE to abort the
verification. Then you may try another EPROM or return to the menu.
</p>
<h4>
2. Read in to RAM from EPROM
</h4>
<p>
You are first asked for the start address of the RAM block where you want
the contents of the EPROM to be dumped. A default address is shown so just
press <span class="uppercase">Newline</span> if this does not need to be changed. The whole of the EPROM will
