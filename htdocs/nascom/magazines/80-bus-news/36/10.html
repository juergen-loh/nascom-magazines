<p>
At F068 change 31 to 33
At FBO8 change 3A 60 00 to CD EF FF
At FCO3 change 11 99 FC to 3D 20 FD

These changes have been carefully checked and the results fully tested,
so you should have no difficulty. You can check that you have typed in the
changes correctly by using the standard CRC calculating program. For your
convenience this program has been run separately on the first 2K of RP/M V2.3
(CRC = EF 24) and the second half (CRC = 58 CD). Therefore you can easily
confirm that your new RP/M&nbsp;2.3 is correct. The CRC calculating program is
called CRC.COM and is the subject of another article in this issue.
