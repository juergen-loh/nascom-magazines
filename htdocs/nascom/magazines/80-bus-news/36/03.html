<h3>
<u>Spelling</u>
</h3>
<p>
From time to time people write in and complain about the spelling
mistooks in the mag. Well I&rsquo;m sorry if they bother you, perhaps you would
like to volunteer to do the proof-reading? Even if I do say it myself (as I
am sure that no one else will) my own spelling is pretty good. It&rsquo;s just that
on the computer screen it is easy to miss various errors, the resulting print
out goes to the printers, the finished magazine comes back, I open up a copy
to see what it looks like, and lo and behold the first page that I look at has
an error staring at me. This could probably be solved by me re-reading
everything a couple of times after I&rsquo;ve printed it out, but what, with a more-than-full-time
job to hold down, a small amount of socialising to keep me
sane, a house to run, these magazines to produce, and still only 24 hours in a
day .... well, let&rsquo;s just say that a few spelling mistooks here and there are
right at the bottom of my priority list, and I hope yours too. (You can now
put your hankies away!)

<h3>
<u>Disks not tapes</u>
</h3>
<p>
What would help a lot would be if those of you with disk systems who
submit articles could send them in on disk. I&rsquo;m not sure why, but some
articles about disk related topics, and thus obviously from disk system
owners, arrive on cassette (and sometimes just on paper!). Now I recognise
that cassettes (and paper) are cheaper than disks, but I do send disks back,
honest! And it is much easier to read a disk than it is to find a cassette
recorder, a lead, a program that will read the particular tape format being
submitted, etc, etc. And as for having to type the whole lot in from
scratch... So please, if you are sending in an article and can send it in on
disk, in virtually any format or size, then please do so. It makes life so
much easier, and improves the chances of the mags. being out on time.

<h3>
<u>Bulletin Boards</u>
</h3>
<p>
In an article in this issue Dave Hunt
<a href="../../26/text/#article1">mentions</a>
the possibility of a
telephone bulletin board being set up by a dealer. Well one has been set up
since he wrote the article. Try ____-______ between 5.30&nbsp;pm and 9&nbsp;am, 300&nbsp;baud.

<h3>
<u>Reading the small print</u>
</h3>
<p>
A little while ago I tried an experiment with small print with a view to
reducing our increasing costs, and
<a href="../../../33/31/text/#article1">asked for your reaction</a>
to this. (See Vol.&nbsp;3,
Issue&nbsp;3, pages&nbsp;31-33.) Well a number of people have kindly responded.
Some said that they thought that it was fine, but the majority wondered
whether I was being paid by some opticians&rdquo; society! The reaction, therefore,
was not favourable, and many said that they would rather see an increase in
subscriptions than see the magazine reduced to this level (pun intended!). As
the price of the mag. has never changed since it started three years ago this
seems quite reasonable to me! Another reaction was that some people would
prefer to see the magazine appearing regularly, even if this meant less
frequently, and that the size could be increased so that the overall quantity
of material per annum remained constant. This would have the advantage of
reducing postage cost (fewer magazines) and printing costs (fewer larger
magazines are cheaper to print than more smaller ones).
</p>
<p>
I am therefore considering a combination of all of these comments, and
you will see the first signs of the new format, whatever that may be, with the
arrival of the
<a href="../../../41/01/text/#page">first 1985 issue</a>.
(Hands up whoever added &ldquo;in 1987&rdquo;.)
