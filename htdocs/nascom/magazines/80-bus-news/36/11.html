This article describes the construction of a very cheap EPROM programmer
for the Nascom owner who, like me, has to run his Nascom on a budget. It can
be built for less than &pound;20 including the cost of a zero insertion force
socket.
</p>
<p>
Most inexpensive programmers that use only one <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> generate the address
lines from a CD4040 12-stage counter giving a range of 4096 (2^12) addresses,
i.e. the largest EPROM that they can handle being the <?php externalLink("2732","",""); ?>. However, the 2732
is no longer cost-effective, the best value as far as bits per pound at the
moment is given by the <?php externalLink("2764","",""); ?>, and the 27128 will no doubt fall in price.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to get the programmer built and working as quickly as possible
and the following points were the main constraints on the design:
</p>
<ol class="indent2">
<li>Low cost</li>
<li>Minimum hardware</li>
<li>Simple software</li>
<li>Capable of programming up to 27128</li>
</ol>
<p>
With low cost being the main priority, points 2 and 3 naturally follow.
Minimum hardware means that there is no automatic switching of power supplies
or selection of EPROM type. Power supplies are switched manually and the EPROM
type is selected by inserting a suitably wired header plug into the selector
socket. Since all switching is manual the software can be very simple. However
certain &lsquo;awkward&rsquo; EPROMS do not follow the usual pattern, particularly the
2732 which does not have a &lsquo;VERIFY&rsquo; mode and uses a common pin connection for
/OE and Vpp. This would require additional circuitry to do the switching so I
just left the 2732 out. I don&rsquo;t find this a problem since I doubt if I will
ever use a 2732, unless somebody gives me some! Its brother, the 2532 is also
a bit awkward since it does not have a &lsquo;VERIFY&rsquo; mode either. In this mode the
contents of the EPROM may be read with Vpp at +21V (or +25V) so that each
location may be verified immediately after programming without having to
switch off Vpp. The original control program I wrote uses this feature so that
any faulty locations are reported immediately. However this meant that the
2532 was excluded also. So, in order to include at least one 4K EPROM, I
modified the program to do all verifying when programming is complete so that
Vpp can be switched off before verification if a 2532 is being programmed.
Thus the following EPROMS can be programmed&nbsp;:&ndash; <?php externalLink("2716","",""); ?>, 2516, 2532, 2764, 27128
(and perhaps the 27256, but I don&rsquo;t have any data on this one and I think it
uses a different Vpp).
</p>
<p>
Leaving everything to the human operator is, of course, asking for
trouble, but with prompts on the Nascom screen together with warning lights to
show when power is applied to the EPROM I have found it easy to get into a
routine when programming an EPROM. So as long as you take some care you
shouldn&rsquo;t have any problems&nbsp;&ndash; although it&rsquo;s probably best to keep off the
home-brew while you are using the programmer!

<p>
Referring to fig&nbsp;1, the 14 address lines are supplied from a PIO. The 8
data lines and 3 control lines are supplied from another PIO. The data lines
and most of the address lines are taken directly to the pins of the 28-pin ZIF
socket, since these connections are common to all EPROMs. Address lines A11
