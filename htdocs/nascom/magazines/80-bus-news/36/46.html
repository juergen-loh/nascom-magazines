In order to keep my extra code to a minimum, I used a number of inbuilt
&ldquo;SYS&rdquo; routines to carry out certain tasks. These are:
</p>
<p>
SETCUR ;Set cursor on IVC from values in HL, adding any
soffsets needed. H holds ROW: L holds COLUMN
</p>
<p>
CRIX ; Outputs Char. in -A&rdquo; to IVC card.
</p>
<p>
SAVCUR ; Saves current cursor location in SYS workspace.
;( In a Store &ldquo;LABELLED&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;CURSOR&rdquo; )
</p>
<p>
The first action needed in the lock top line routine, is to store the
current position of the IVC cursor, which will be well down the screen on
-COLD BOOT&rsquo;, having just printed the sign-on messages. SETCUR is then called
to set the cursor to the start of line two, and ESC &ldquo;M&rdquo; is sent to the IVC to
lock the top line. (see IVC software manual ). The Cursor is then replaced at
its&rsquo; original location down the screen. Note that CLOCK and LOCK must both be
&ldquo;TRUE&rdquo; for this code to be assembled.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I ought to mention the meaning of the -R&rdquo; that appears in
the source code, for those not accustomed to SYS BIOS listings. SYS is
designed to load from disk, where it is stored as a .COM file. It loads to low
memory, and then a -Relocation&rdquo; section loads SYS over the origional CBIOS,
and adjusts all references to memory locations that are position (address)
sensitive. The only way that SYS knows which bytes to adjust is by being told
by the person writing the code. The addition of the -R&rsquo; after ALL memory
references that need to be adjusted will ensure that SYS will include them in
a table of such addresses, and will carry out the necessary relocation.
</p>
<p>
The final section of SYS that has code added is the Low level I/O
routines. (Module 5 of SYS 16.) The actual Clock routines are added into the
IVC Keyboard routines in my SYS if CLOCK is set -TRUE&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
The first part of the code sets HL to point to UDSTOR which will be
loaded with the ASCII value of Seconds, Tens of Secs. or Minutes (depending on
OFFSET). This value is then read in from the clock, checked for validity,
converted to ASCII, and then placed into UDSTOR. The corresponding data stored
in REGS at the last clock update is then compared with UDSTOR. If the values
are the same, then the clock has not changed, and no clock processing occurs,
but the program goes on to scan the keyboard. If the values are different, the
clock has changed and so it must be updated. By making the comparison on Data
that alters either by the Second, ten Seconds, or Minute the clock can be made
to update accordingly as the operator desires.
</p>
<p>
The keyboard is being scanned many times a second, and if the clock is
allowed to update every time, the net effect is to greatly reduce the speed of
many operations. Since the check just described only takes some twenty or
thirty microseconds, it has no noticeable effect on normal operations, and
prevents the clock from intruding into them. I have not calculated the time
that the clock routine takes, but I would guess that it takes about one
millisecond, and so there is no noticeable effect on operations when it
updates.
</p>
<p>
If the clock has changed, a call is made to READIT, which is the actual
clock read and display subroutine. This subroutine may be called from external
programs via the extra jump that was added to the -jump table&rdquo;. This module
starts by reading the number of clock registers defined in NMRREG into the
