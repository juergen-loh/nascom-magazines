there is still room for improvement, as since writing these I have discovered
that it is possible for a clock register to become programmed with 0FH as a
legitimate character, caused by spurious pulses on the PIO lines. Under these
circumstances the program goes into a permanent loop, thinking that the clock has
just changed time. Some sort of time-out is required, where say, after having had
256 goes at reading the clock and failed, the routine returns the register
contents regardless.

Having fitted a real time clock (RTC) some use has to be found to justify
the clock. In the circles I move in, a couple of people have already found uses
for the clock. Richard has modified his M80 assembler to include the time and
date on printed listings, which can be very useful. David has written an elegant
little utility called INDEX which gives a CP/M directory listing and allows a one
line comment after each program entry. The date being added to the index created
at the time of updating. I hope INDEX will see it&rsquo;s way round a larger circle
goon, although, as it requires the
<?php externalLink("GM822"); ?>
RTC to be hung on a Z80 PIO at port 1CH,
it does make it a dedicated program, and therefore not universally usable. Note
that in each instance port 1CH has been used, and it has been mutually agreed
amongst ourselves that port 1CH will be the clock port. My own interest has been
to hook the clock into a compiled Basic program.

As was mentioned earlier, the MM58174A clock exhibits a peculiar
characteristic, in that it gains time if access is made to it over too long a
time frame. I do not have the National data sheet to hand, but if I remember
correctly, the clock must be accessed within a period of roughly 15mS from
reading the first register to reading the last. This means that the access
software has to be very fast. On the other hand, in instances where it is not the
intention to display the clock on the screen, reading it back at its fastest
increment of tenths of seconds, this is of little consequence. The software
provided by Gemini certainly fails in this respect in that it wastes a lot of
time within the read loop determining whether the clock has changed time, and if
not, to convert the incoming nibble to ASCII and to save it in the temporary
workspace. The obvious method to correct for this would be to copy the registers
&lsquo;as is&rsquo; to the temporary workspace using the tightest possible loop, perhaps
using an INI instruction or even an INIR instruction if it could be contrived,
then, having copied the registers to the temporary workspace, to sort them out
later. I have not given this approach much thought, but it should be possible.
The later National MM58174AN chip does not suffer from this problem, but is more
expensive.

Making use of the clock to display the time continually. on the screen,
whilst a nice idea, is not as easy as it sounds. That is, assuming the computer
is to be used for other things apart from displaying the time. It is not
difficult to write a program which will continually read the clock and place the
result on the screen, Gemini have already provided the clock read routines, and a
simple change to the software could be made to cause the routine restart itself
instead of making the clock return to the routine which called it. This is a
massive waste of time as the processor is 100% wrapped up in reading the clock.
There is no time left for other things. As the clock is capable of creating
interrupts, one method would be to use the interrupt output connected to the
strobe input of the PIO to create an interrupt every time the clock changed
state. The fastest interrupt rate on the MM58174 is one every half a second, this
could be used to update the clock display every second, whilst causing minimum
disruption to processing of other things. As it happens, the interrupt output of
the GM822 was deliberately not returned to the strobe line of the PIO, as this
could be the cause of some very strange software faults by the creation of
undesired interrupts when used with disk systems (which must not be interrupted),
or other interrupt driven auxiliaries elsewhere in the system, where the use of
the EI and DI instructions could cause other problems. The interrupt output is
connected to one of the output bits which means it can only be used when mode 3,
the bit masked interrupt mode of the PIO is selected. This mode, whilst more
flexible is also more difficult to implement.
