<u>Doctor Dark&rsquo;s Diary &ndash; Episode 13. Pascal Episode.</u>
</h2>
<p>
Well, the new batch of home brew is just about drinkable, so I had
better get on with this, before the rot sets in...
</p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s kick off with the &ldquo;Rory is right&rdquo; section. He said that
P.J.Brown&rsquo;s new book, &ldquo;Pascal from BASIC&rdquo; should be Computer Book of the year,
and I agree wholeheartedly. If you have been putting off learning Pascal because
you didn&rsquo;t like the look of the text books that were available, you now have no
excuse. I have found a mistake as well, however, on page&nbsp;100. The equation for
the addition of two complex numbers should read:&ndash;
</p>
<pre class="indent">
(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)
</pre>
<p class="continued">
but this is a minor quibble, and anyway the Pascal procedure to do the job is
correct, so perhaps we were being tested to see if we were paying attention...

<u>Free procedure number 1.</u>

<p>
Yet another version of my favourite way of clearing the screen, which I
have now implemented in four different languages, or was it five? Anyway, here
is that old chestnut, the spiral screen wipe, yet again...
</p>
<pre>
PROCEDURE spiral(col : colour);
VAR
  lox, hix, loy, hiy, i, j : integer;
BEGIN
  {Set the size of the first box to be drawn.
  lox := 0; hix := 95; loy := 0; hiy := 44;
  REPEAT
    {Draw a box one pixel wide round the screen.}
    BEGIN
      {Line along the top of the screen.}
      FOR i := lox TO hix DO
        BEGIN
          GRAPH(col,i,loy);
          {This line gives a short delay each time it appears.
          There is no reason why it should not itself be a procedure.}
          FOR j := 1 TO 10 DO BEGIN END
        END;
      {Line down the right hand side of the screen.}
      FOR i := loy+1 TO hiy DO
        BEGIN
          GRAPH(col,hix,i);
          FOR j := 1 TO 10 DO BEGIN END
        END;
      {Line backwards across the bottom of the screen.}
      FOR i := hix-1 DOWNTO lox DO
        BEGIN
          GRAPH(col,i,hiy);
          FOR j := 1 TO 10 DO BEGIN END
        END;
      {Upwards line on the left of the screen.}
      FOR i := hiy-1 DOWNTO loy+i DO
        BEGIN
          GRAPH(col,lox,i);
          FOR j:= 1 TO 10 DO BEGIN END
        END;
