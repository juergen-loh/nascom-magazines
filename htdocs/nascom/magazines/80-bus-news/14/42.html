NASCOM PROGRAM LIBRARY
</p>
<p>
When 80-BUS News absorbed INMC80 we also acquired a quantity of programs from the
program library. We now need the valuable space that they are occupying and so
here are some offers that you can&rsquo;t refuse!! All of the programs are ones which
were sent in by INMC members and are source code listings on A4d paper. In order
to dispose of &lsquo;them quickly we are offering them at &lsquo;giveaway&rsquo; prices, but must
insist on a minimum program order of &pound;1. As we run out of certain lines we will
make up the value of the order with alternative programs. Postage is 30p per UK
order and 60p overseas.
</p>
<p>
These offers hold until January 31, 1983 and after that date the program library
will be permanently closed.
