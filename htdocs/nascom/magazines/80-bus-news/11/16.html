<u>PILOT FEEDBACK</u>
</h3>
<p>
Quite a while ago, I had a letter from R.B.Poate, who said, &ldquo;I would
suggest that you use Naspen or something similar for your line numberless
editor.&rdquo; This is in fact, very near to what I actually intended to do. My plan
was to say something along the lines of &ldquo;Right, here is the specification for
each of the parts of the Pilot interpreter, now let&rsquo;s each write a bit...&rdquo;
Nasty, isn&rsquo;t it? The specification for the editor only has to state the way
the program is stored, and where in memory it actually is, and the task of
adding your (or somebody else&rsquo;s) editor is left to you. Do I hear howls of
&ldquo;Cop out!"?&rdquo; Probably, but you see I don&rsquo;t want to write two or more versions
of the same thing, and my one is to run under CP/M, not Nas-Sys. That is why
all the monitor calls in the code so far printed go to vectors.
</p>
<h3>
<u>WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...</u>
</h3>
<p>
The editor will be any code you care to write that enables you to
manipulate the stored program to your own satisfaction. It fits into the free
code from the earlier episode where lines 1490 to 1500 currently are. Yes,
Heloise, I do know I forgot to resequence that bit. The program storage area
starts at location RAM, and the first two bytes hold the address of the last
byte of the program [low byte first, of course.] Having tried more than once
to write a decent editor program, I am copping out yet again; I shall be using
an editor written by the genius at Hi-Soft. See next section... In order that
the programs we all produce will be compatible, we will all separate lines
with the combination of characters, CR LF [in other words, 0D 0A]. This will
cause howls of apathy, or possibly anger I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, from those of you
without CP/M and disks, who would have preferred to use 0D on its own. Why
aren&rsquo;t you writing this?
</p>
<p>
The Load module, which replaces lines 1450 to 1460 of the listing,
reads from tape, disk, Tibetan prayer wheel, or other mass storage unit into
the memory, at location RAM. Users of any Nascom monitor, it is your turn to
be smug, because the monitor will do this for you with very little extra code
of your own.
</p>
<p>
The Save module, lines 1470 to 1480, it will hardly surprise you to
learn, transfers the program to the storage medium from the memory. Now do you
see why RAM and RAM+1 hold the address of the end of the program? [If you
don&rsquo;t, why are you reading hard core computer magazines?]

<u>A SOFTWARE REVIEW.</u>
</h3>
<p>
This review concerns the &ldquo;Z80 development package&rdquo; currently being
sold by <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft",""); ?>. The package consists of an editor, an assembler, a debugger
[*** semantics error ***] and another program whose use I have not yet
discovered. The package sells for 50.00, a price which compares extremely
favourably with the amount you would need to lash out to buy Diskpen and Macro
80, [about 150.00, I think.] The assembler works very well, also fast. It can
handle source files far larger than your computer&rsquo;s memory, as can the editor.
The editor is a joy to use (I know!! &ndash; Ed.), especially after you have become
used to the horrors of ED.COM. An especially nice feature is the way it copes
with very long lines, by scrolling the whole screen across, instead of
wrapping round to the next line, or crashing, or any of the weird things some
editors do when you ask more of them than their authors intended. The debugger
takes a while to get used to, but is very useful, I have found it very good
indeed at finding the silly errors in my early attempts at converting the
skeletal Pilot to a CP/M form. If this package does not seriously dent sales
of both Diskpen and the grossly overpriced Macro&nbsp;80, I shall be very surprised
indeed. So that you will not think I am being paid by Hi-Soft to say these
nice things about their product, I will just mention in passing that I was
very annoyed to have to wait over a fortnight for delivery. It was worth
waiting for, but why was it necessary to wait?
