<h3>
<u>FREE SOFT&shy;WARE?</u>
</h3>
<p>
Last summer I made a trip to my local friendly Nascom dealer to buy a
copy of the source of SYS. Rather than PIP each file across by itself, the guy
copied the entire disk, and then erased the files that I shouldn&rsquo;t have. These
files included DISKPEN.
</p>
<p>
CP/M doesn&rsquo;t erase the whole file when a file is deleted, all it does
is change the first byte of the file&rsquo;s directory entry from 00H to E5H, so
when I got home, I just changed the byte on the erased files back to 00H using
D-DOS. All I then had to do was find a way to stop the E and W commands from
disappearing as soon I used &lsquo;Insert&rsquo;, because, of course the program hadn&rsquo;t
been initialized, and so didn&rsquo;t work properly. It was an easy job, all I had
to do was alter a couple of RETurn&rsquo;s to CALL&rsquo;s. Have a look at your disk with
the source of SYS on it, if you haven&rsquo;t recorded anything else onto it, you
might be lucky too! (Oh know you won&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re wise to that one, and the SYS
source and DISKPEN are now on separate disks, anyway. Watch out, they&rsquo;ll be
round to collect the royalties! &ndash; Ed.)
</p>
<p>
A couple of criticisms of DISKPEN. It needs a &lsquo;continuous change&rsquo;
command, which is to &lsquo;c&rsquo; as &lsquo;I&rsquo; is to &lsquo;i&rsquo;. The &lsquo;change keyboard case&rsquo;, U,
needs to be duplicated by &lsquo;u&rsquo;. (Why, you lost the use of your shift key or
something, or is it because it was ripped off and you haven&rsquo;t got the
documentation? &ndash; Ed.) It would be nice if the &lsquo;find&rsquo; commands supported &lsquo;wild&rsquo;
characters, as CP/M&rsquo;s CCP does, using ?? and *.
</p>
<p>
Incidently, just to save the editor&rsquo;s blushes, I must admit that I
don&rsquo;t use DISKPEN. I use Michael Shrayer&rsquo;s Electric Pencil II as a text
editor, I find it far preferable to DISKPEN except for it&rsquo;s lack of on-screen
formatting, (It will only format what&rsquo;s being sent to the printer), but then,
it is three times the price of DISKPEN, and only works with a 64 x 16
character screen.

<h3>
<u>USING THE TOP LINE</u>
</h3>
<p>
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could use the top line of the video display
as if it were any other line. Some of that information that gets missed
because it scrolls off the screen before we manage to hit ^S could be read, if
we could see sixteen lines of text instead of just fifteen. (See earlier &lsquo;Ed.&rsquo;
&ndash; Ed.)
</p>
<p>
Having the screen handling part of the CBIOS in RAM makes it so easy
to adapt. Instructions follow: First go to your local friendly dealer and
purchase the source of SYS, well worth the tenner that it&rsquo;ll cost you, and
using Electric Pencil, or whatever your favourite text editor is add the
following code.
