Edit and Ecmd &nbsp; These overlay files control the EDIT command, enabling
seperate source and destination files to be given as parameters. The editor
supports a wide range of functions and acts as a window on the text. Commands
are available for moving/inserting/deleting/finding-changing portions of text
in a most powerful way. The files created are suitable for submitting to the
assembler or BASIC or as just text files. The Edit overlay may also be called
by a user&rsquo;s program for specialised applications. A seperate utility program
is available called Polytext for formatting and print time adjustment of
letters and documents.

<p class="noindent">
FORMAT The format utility programmme is used for the first time initialisation
of blank diskettes. It allows disks to be formatted in single density or
double density in the case of a G815/G809 system with automatic verify to
check the data can be read back. Diskettes may also just be verified if
required.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
BACKUP This utility program is used to make direct image copies of diskettes
as the name implies, it can also be used on a single drive system allowing the
user to place the source disk in the drive which is then read, the user is
then prompted to place the destination disk in the drive and the data is then
transferred.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
SZAP This very powerful program allows you to dive straight into the disk and
display the data held there. This is not for the faint hearted since the data
can be directly modified on the disk, thus a few careless key presses could
result in loss of directory information and render the data useless.

When &ldquo;BASIC&rdquo; is typed in the command line mode, a file called
&ldquo;BSdr.BR&rdquo; is loaded which holds the routines for the Disk BASIC, control is
then passed to the ROM BASIC. The BASIC under Polydos is an enhanced version
of the Nascom BASIC allowing such features as:
