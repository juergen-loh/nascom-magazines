It would appear that Quantum Micros decided that they were so busy
with their Quantum 2000 (a rather smart looking three (yes 3!!) drive system
based on Gemini MultiBoard) that they have handed-over/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sold/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>given (??) rights
of their I/O card to Gemini. This card, given the Gemini magic number of
<?php externalLink("GM816","",""); ?>,
will come built and tested with 3 Z80A PIOs, 1 <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC", "CTC", ""); ?>, and a battery
backed Real Time Clock. (Seems that those blasted RTC things are about to
appear everywhere, as Gemini are also about to produce a mini one that
attaches to the Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>.) The rather neat thing about the Gemini
(nee Quantum) I/O board is that, as all the I/O decoding and buffering has
already been done, it contains an on-board 50 odd way bus, and holes to take
&lsquo;piggy-back&rsquo; sub-boards. This gives the potential of all sorts of natty I/O,
the only snag being that you probably can only have one &lsquo;piggy-back&rsquo; per I/O
board. Gemini say availability of both the I/O and RTC boards will be late
March/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>early April.

All sorts of rumours are floating about re. the Nascom
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
(Advanced
Video Controller) board. Production has been put back several times, and the
latest &lsquo;promise&rsquo; appears to be late April/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>early May. One thing for sure is
that it was not to be seen at a recent London show. The provisional (rumoured)
spec. sounds pretty impressive, but the complexity of the board seems to have
turned it into a 10&Prime;x8&Prime; board. Now let&rsquo;s see, if we take a Nascom&nbsp;2 (12x8), an
AVC (10x8), a RAM card (8x8), and an Arfon speech board (5x8), we can design a
&lsquo;Pyramid&rsquo; case!! The board is said to have 48K of RAM on board (16K per
colour) which should give very pretty pictures (software allowing), but there
seem to be conflicting reports as to whether it can handle text or not &ndash;
hmmmm.

Any visitor to Gemini a couple of weeks ago may have recognised the
faces of most (all?) of the &lsquo;MicroValue&rsquo; dealers. (By the way &lsquo;Micro&rsquo; means
very little/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>small doesn&rsquo;t it.......) It seems that they were picking up their
first production Gemini Galaxy 1 units, or was there some scheming going on?
The Galaxy, by the way, is a collection of MultiBoard cards
(CPU/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>RAM/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?><?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>FDC),
2 Micropolis 400K drives, and a switch mode PSU in a metal case. The keyboard
is in a separate unit. The whole thing looks as sturdy as a brick ****&ndash;*****,
and comes complete with a fair range of software. Can a British company
out-Osborne Osborne? At the price (1450 + Maggie&rsquo;s bit) it seems to be priced
only a little lower than the sum of the bits, but of course there are lots of
nice looking connectors on the back (they generally cost quite a bit) and you
don&rsquo;t have to assemble the lot yourself. Going rather up-market for us
hobby-types, though.

<p>
Nascom&nbsp;3 also seems to have been sneaked out fairly quietly. Lot&rsquo;s of
rumours were floating around about that, but none of them appear to have been
right. It is in fact a Nascom&nbsp;2 in a box, although you do get the (obligatory)
Graphics ROM and also Nas-Sys&nbsp;3. The time was well overdue that a cased Nascom
become available, (if you remember, &lsquo;System 80&rsquo; would have arrived, had the
receiver not&hellip;) and the case is also going to be available to those who want
to construct their own N3s. (By the way, MultiBoard owners will be able to get
hold of the Galaxy case.) Will Nascom&nbsp;4 be Nascom&nbsp;3 with an AVC??

Watch this space for further ill-informed rumours.
