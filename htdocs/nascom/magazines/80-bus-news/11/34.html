Perusal of the computer bookshelf in a good technical bookshop will
often reveal titles which your friendly local computer store has never heard
of, and which may be most relevant to you and the direction of development of
your system. These books are usually text books, and make for very dry
reading, but the information is there in them nevertheless.
</p>
<p>
A good plan is to read them a small bit at a time, allowing time for
the information to sink in. They are not written in general about specific
machines, and discuss instead the general concepts, which are applicable to
all computers.
</p>
<p>
It would be beyond my power to review in depth a number of these
books. I would like instead to mention some of them, with a short comment on
the contents or field of applicability, in the hope that you can find a copy
in your local bookshop or library to help you decide if it is relevant to you
before purchase.

<h3>
<u>Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</u>
</h3>
<?php columnChange(3); ?>
<h4 class="author">

<?php columnEnd(3); ?>

<p>
This is by the father of Pascal, and is regarded as being one of the
seminal books on the design of computer programs. Wirth is of the opinion that
correct computing springs from a correct structuring of the data, and
application to this of the best algorithm. His langage Pascal is based on this
postulate. This book is regularly used as a teaching book in universities &ndash;
even those who do not teach Pascal!

<h3>
<u>An Introduction to Data Structures with Applications</u>
</h3>
<?php columnChange(3); ?>
<h4 class="author">
By Tremblay and Sorenson<br>
Publ. McGraw Hill
</h4>
<?php columnEnd(3); ?>
<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<p>
This is perhaps the cheapest of the standard books on data structures,
being available in a McGraw Hill Student edition for about 10.00 (some other
data structure books run to 30.00!). It gives examples in PL/1, which is quite
close to Pascal or Structured English. I&rsquo;ll quote its chapterheadings to give
you an idea what it is about.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Information and its Storage Representation<br>
The representation and manipulation of strings<br>
Linear data structures and their Sequential Storage Representaion<br>
Linear data structures and their Linked Storage Representation<br>
Sorting and Searching<br>
File Structures.
</p>
<p>
It is a hefty volume, running to just over 700 pages, and I am wading
through it. It is not the lightest reading in the world, but it seems very
complete.

<h3>
<u>Fundamentals of Operating Systems</u>
</h3>
<?php columnChange(3); ?>
<h4 class="author">
By Lister<br>
Publ. Macmillan
</h4>
<?php columnEnd(3); ?>
<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<p>
This book is concerned with the design of the operating systems (the
monitor) for large or multiuser computer systems. With the advent of disks,
and other expansions, such as possible multiple processors on a bus or
multiple users on the same machine, as might happen in schools, this subject
will become more and more relevant.

<h3>
<u>Closing Comments</u>
</h3>
<p>
Please bear in mind that these books are text books, and consider them
well before you rush over to the cashdesk to purchase them. Perhaps you may
find them absolutely indigestible! If you are minded to buy a book with a view
to construction or design of some project, then I&rsquo;d recommend Ciarcia or
Sargent &amp; Shoemaker. If the higher theory would be of interest, then I think
Software Tools in Pascal would be a good starting point. I have not seen this
particular volume, I stress again, but am quite confident of its general
usefulness. In addition, we have two excellent Pascal Compilers available for
the Nascom, the <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Naspas and Polydata&rsquo;s. With a little bit of adjustment
I feel sure the Software Tools programs will run on these.
