Polyzap. This is the disk based assembler provided with the Polydos
package. It has all the usual assembler features such as pseudo operations
which allow conditional assembly, object file definition and the ability to
reference previously created symbol files. The ability to use previous symbol
files is very powerful and is illustrated by the fact that a file called
&ldquo;SYSEQU.SY&rdquo; is provided on the master disk which holds all the equated values
relating to Polydos workspace, NAS-SYS workspace, subroutine numbers and ASCII
character codes. Instead of typing a list of equates in at the start of each
program, a statement referencing the file can be used and then a line such as:
</p>
<pre>
DEMO    SCAL ZB2HEX ;this routine converts binary to hex
</pre>
<p class="continued">
may be used which saves lots of tedious typing. There are several other
features which are available at assembly time such as force second pass,
create symbol file, list symbol table, assembly listing to printer with
heading plus a few others.
</p>

Summary. The package is well presented and very well documented although there
are various spelling mistakes in the manual which one does not expect when so
much trouble has gone into the rest of the system. The availability of a
decent Nascom oriented disk operating system is a relief since the only other
real option is CP/M&nbsp;&ndash; a silly choice as you have to throw away your existing
software, get 64k of RAM and a Gemini 80x25
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
card to get the best from it
and after that you do not have a Nascom anymore, just another machine which
runs CP/M! (Note also that CP/M does not include any form of BASIC or even a
Z80 assembler which would together cost in the region of 200.00!). Polydos was
purchased from EV Computing in Manchester but is available from your friendly
local Microvalue dealer for a fee of 90.00 plus Maggie&rsquo;s bit, which
considering the cost of ZEAP, Programmer&rsquo;s aid and Naspen (which are not
required) is excellent value for money.

<h3>
<u>Scottish Nascom User Group</u>
</h3>
<p>
It is proposed to form a local Nascom User Group, probably as a sub-group of
the Grampian Amateur Computer Society, depending on prospective members
wishes. If you are interested then contact either:

<u class="uppercase">Shropshire Nascom Group</u>
</h3>
<p>
If anyone is interested in forming a Nascom group in Shropshire please contact
me at the address below, giving brief details of equipment and interests. I am
interested in the use of my Nascom&nbsp;2 in Amateur Radio on 70cm.
</p>
<p>
Has anyone used the <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC", "CTC"); ?> chip on the Nascom I/O board successfully? I would
welcome some basic help in getting some results in this area.
