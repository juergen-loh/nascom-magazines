<u>MONITOR.COM</u>

<p>
This is a program that runs on a Nascom&nbsp;2 under CP/M, and pretends to
be an improved version of Nas-Sys. The improvements consist of additional
routines to move sections of the memory to disk, and read them back. The
details of how to do this have appeared in the
<a href="../../../../micropower/12/12/text/#article1">second issue of Micropower</a>,
a magazine that says quite kind things about this magazine. As quite a lot of
typing is needed, I will repeat here the offer I made in the Micropower
article. Anyone who wants a copy of
<a href="../../../../micropower/12/12/text/#article1">MONITOR.COM</a> should send a disk,
initialised for their system, plus a pound for postage, packing and not a lot
of profit! Frankly, if you have no desire to use all the programs you wrote
before you had your disk drive/s, or have a hardware way of switching to
Nas-Sys, you don&rsquo;t need this, so there! As an aside, I should mention that the
rather primitive disk read and write routines I have written for the program
don&rsquo;t work for files longer than 16K. There, saved you the effort of writing
to tell me!

<u>DISKPEN.COM</u>
</h3>
<p>
I just converted my EPROM Naspen to use the somewhat altered screen
addressing of my system, in a RAM version loaded from disk by MONITOR.COM, and
am rather pleased with myself! I wanted Diskpen, but there was no more cash to
hand, so that was that, for a while. See later in the episode for details of
another editor.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the files produced by my rather clumsy modifications are
not quite CP/M compatible, having only Carriage Returns where there should
also be Line Feeds. I get round this slight problem by using another program,
whose function is to grab the Naspen file left in memory by the converted
Naspen, add line feeds to it and store it as a CP/M file on disk. They can
then be edited again with CP/M compatible editors, if necessary, though I keep
my working copy on tape, ready to send in for publication.

Meanwhile, here for your interest, if any, are the changes to Naspen
needed if the VDU RAM in your system is at F800H:

One slightly unexpected problem I had during the conversion of Naspen
was that the board I was reading it from, a Merseyside Nascom Users Group
EPROM board, doesn&rsquo;t seem to send out a RAMDIS signal. Filling the RAM
addresses concerned with FF&rsquo;s enabled me to copy the program to an area that
wasn&rsquo;t duplicated by more than one board. You may well ask how much RAM there
is on the new system&hellip; I hardly like to go on about this, but it is a certain
manufacturer&rsquo;s 64K page mode job, and what was memory plague, anyway? I should
know better than to write that, as I am proposing to reassemble the venerable
Marvin soon, so that I can play at Nascom&nbsp;1/2 system games.
