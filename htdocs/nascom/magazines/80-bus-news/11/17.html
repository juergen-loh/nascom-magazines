<u>National Semiconductor MM58174</u>
</h3>
<p>
The National Semiconductor MM58174 is a CMOS real-time clock and calender chip in a
16-pin DIL package which is easily interfaced to the Nasbus. This device incorporates
4-bit registers from which the CPU can read, as BCD digits, the time from 1/10ths secs.
to tens of hours, the day of the week, and the date from days to tens of months. The
on-chip oscillator is controlled by a 32768 Hz crystal and timekeeping can be maintained
by a backup battery when the 5V supply is switched off. In addition, the MM58174
provides a facility for generating CPU interrupts at intervals of 0.5 sec, 5 sec or 40
sec.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Interfacing to Nascom</u>
</h3>
<p>
The circuit used by the writer to interface the MM58174 to his <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;1</span> is shown
below. The circuit was assembled on a Vero DIL prototyping board which plugged into a
spare 80-way connector on the NASBUS. Bus timing was not a problem with the <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;1</span>
which runs with a 2 Mc/s clock and should still be acceptable with the 4 Mc/s clock of
the <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> provided that the 500ns MM58174N is used.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Addressing</u>
</h3>
<p>
The clock chip is interfaced onto the bus occupying 16 I/O port addresses (20H to 2FH in
the writer&rsquo;s system), The bus address lines A0 to A5 connect to the clock register
address input pins AD0 to AD5. The upper I/O address lines A4 to A7 are decoded by a
7ALS145 to select addresses in the range 20H to 2FH. The clock chip is selected when an
address in this range coincides with <?php invertedSignal("IORQ"); ?>.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Data input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output</u>
</h3>
<p>
The clock&rsquo;s data I/O pins DB0 to DB3 connect to the NASBUS data I/O lines D0 ta D3. The
NASBUS <?php invertedSignal("RD"); ?> and <?php invertedSignal("WR"); ?> lines
connect directly to the MM58174&rsquo;s NRDS and NWDS pins. The NAS
data bus is switched to the read direction by pulling <?php invertedSignal("DBDR"); ?> down
when the clock chip is read by the CPU.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Interrupt Control</u>
</h3>
<p>
Additional logic is included ta enable the MM5174&rsquo;s interrupt facility to be
used. When the clock&rsquo;s interrupt output goes low, an interrupt is initiated provided
IEI is high&nbsp;&ndash; i.e. no higher priority interrupt is active. While either the clock
interrupt or a higher priority interrupt is active, IEO is held low to inhibit any lower
priority interrupts.
</p>
<p>
Operation in the Z80 interrupt mode 2 is provided for by pulling all eight data lines
down to return a zero interrupt vector (i.e. 00H) in response to the CPU&rsquo;s interrupt
acknowledge (<?php invertedSignal("IORQ"); ?> active with <?php invertedSignal("M1"); ?>).
Simultaneously, <?php invertedSignal("DBDR"); ?> is pulled down to switch the
data bus to the read direction.
</p>
<p>
All this logic can, of course, be omitted if the interrupt facility is not needed.
