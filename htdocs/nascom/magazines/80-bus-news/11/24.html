INMC80-5, page 20. In my review of the Econographics for the N1, where
I say &ldquo;is not acceptable&rdquo;, please substitute &ldquo;is not unacceptable&rdquo;. The
Econographics unit gives a very slight line between solid blocks of white, but
it is not objectional. I am also informed by Nascom that the faulty piece of
artwork for the track patterns has been withdrawn, and profuse apologies have
been expressed for any inconvenience. With any luck, any Econographics units
around will now be from the correct track pattern.
