Polydos is designed as a disk operating system for a Nascom with either
Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 or 3 monitors, Nascom ROM BASIC and ideally 48k of RAM. If the full
48k is not fitted then 4k must be fitted at address C000 hex as this is
Polydos&rsquo;s workspace area. Two types of disk hardware are supported, namely the
Gemini G805 (single density) and Gemini G809/G815 (single or double density)
disk drive units. The type of disk unit must be specified when Polydos is
ordered since the actual disk driver routines are different. The package as
supplied contains two 2708 type EPROMs which contain the bootstrap routines,
the package also contains a serialised distribution copy of the operating
system itself and one very thick manual! The EPROMs are located at address
D000 hex and fitting instructions are given in detail. Don&rsquo;t worry if you have
ZEAP in EPROM at this address because you can throw it (or give it) away!
Incidently, if you have Naspen or Programmer&rsquo;s aid, you will probably find
these also residing in the depths of your dustbin before long. What is the
reason for this madness? Very simple really, along with the disk operating
system itself is an excellent disk based assembler, an enhanced BASIC and a
disk based text editor along with a few other goodies! The package is divided
into several major sections which are as follows&ndash;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Exec. &nbsp; This is an overlay file which is loaded into the overlay area at C800H
to CFFFH. This program handles the command lines which prompt the user with a
&lsquo;$&rsquo; in the first character position in the line. If the &lsquo;$&rsquo; is backspaced
over, normal Nas-Sys commands are available with the exception of the &lsquo;S&rsquo; and
&lsquo;B&rsquo; commands. An &lsquo;E0&rsquo; command will restore normal operation on these commands.
The Exec file contains the code for most of the commands available including:
DIR &ndash; directory, upto 50 entries with options for statistical data and
directory to printer; DEL and UNDEL &ndash; allow files to be deleted, and recovered
if accidentally deleted; SAVE and LOAD &ndash; normally used to manipulate machine
code files without execution, an optional load address can be specified; LIST
and SKIP &ndash; printer control commands for hardcopy of files or list to display;
READ and WRITE &ndash; direct sector versions of LOAD and SAVE; NEW &ndash; tells Polydos
you have replaced a disk since directory is held in RAM and must be updated;
BOOT &ndash; allows complete reboot of system.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Dfun &nbsp; This is another overlay file which handles the following commands:
COPY &ndash; disk to disk copy and allows single disk copying; REN &ndash; rename files;
LOCK and UNLOCK &ndash; prohibits file deletion or listing in the normal form of the
DIR command; ATTRIB &ndash; redefine load and execution addresses of files; PACK &ndash;
removes deleted files and re-packs disk; NAME &ndash; give a disk a new name; BUFFER
&ndash; redefine start and length of RAM buffer used in PACK, COPY and LIST
commands.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Emsg &nbsp; This overlay is invoked everytime a system error occurs to print the
error message.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Info &nbsp; This file is loaded on boot up (if present) otherwise default
parameters are substituted into the information file area at C200H to C2FFH.
The file contains parameters relating to the cursor including blink rate and
character type and also to the printer including initialisation string and low
level driver.
