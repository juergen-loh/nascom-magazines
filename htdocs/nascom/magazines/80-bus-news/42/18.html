A Brief Guide to MailMerge

Many readers of 80-BUS News will have heard of or
used WordStar &mdash; one of a series of very useful
programs produced by Micropro. Apart from
WordStar, a sophisticated word-processing package,
there is SpellStar, a spelling check facility, and
MailMerge.
</p>
<p>
Both MailMerge and SpellStar can only be accessed
from within WordStar; the appropriate files
(MAILMERG.OVR and SPELSTAR.OVR) which are
supplied separately from WordStar, must be
available on the logged-in disk [Ed. &mdash; or the disk
specified in the WordStar patch area, normally A:].
The appropriate program is called up from the &lsquo;no
file&rsquo; WordStar menu. SpellStar has a comprehensive
range of facilities which are selectable from a
menu. Further information is provided in section 13
of the main WordStar manual. Mailmerge is also
well-documented&nbsp;&ndash; sections 9&nbsp;&ndash; 12 of the same
manual deals at length with all aspects of the
facility.
</p>
<p>
For most purposes, only a small proportion of the
documentation is needed but the relevant bits are
often difficult to locate; this article aims to provide
a simple guide to the more commonly used
features of MailMerge for the non-expert user.

Richard Beal (80-BUS News vol.&nbsp;2 issue&nbsp;3) has dealt
with the

on Gemini machines with the

MailMerge is, as its name suggests, mainly used
for creating and printing personalised letters (the
sort which Dave Hunt consigns to the rubbish bin,
unopened and unread!) for multiple mailings, but
it can also be used for creating letters or documents
in which standard clauses feature regularly
&mdash; which would be useful in Solicitors offices, for
example. The ability to personalise a standard
letter would be useful for many small firms and
clubs, and just the job for aspiring authors to send
their manuscripts (printed by WordStar) to several
dozen publishers!
</p>
<p>
Both MailMerge and WordStar use &lsquo;dot&rsquo; commands
for processing text. They take the form of a
full stop followed by two letters such as .pa which
inserts a page break into the document (similar to
Control L in CP/M or PEN). Some dot commands
are followed by a number or by text; many such
commands exist in WordStar and MailMerge but
normally, only a few are needed and when used,
they must occur at the beginning of a line. A few
dot commands are specific to either WordStar or
MailMerge but many are common to both.
</p>
<p>
WordStar operates in two modes &mdash; Document or
Non-document and the mode required is identified
by typing D or N in response to the initial display.
The Document mode is used for text work and has
automatic text justification among other features
while the Non-document mode is used for listings
and source code programs (and for setting up
MailMerge data and command files). For simple
mail list work, three files are needed &mdash; the
standard letter, a data file with names, addresses
and other information, and a command file
(optional but makes life easier). The command file
works in a similar fashion to a SUBMIT file in CP/M
and enables the use to control the progress of the
letter printing more effectively. It only contains dot
commands, unlike the letter file which contains dot
commands and text.
</p>
<p>
The following dot commands are most commonly
used in MailMerge:<br>
(The file names or variables enclosed in angle brackets
&lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; must be supplied by the user.)
</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>
<b>.av</b> &lt;variable&gt; (Ask for Variable)
</p>
<p>
For most purposes, this will prompt for a
variable such as the date which may be
altered from one mailing to another, and
which would not normally be stored in a data
file. The text following the .av command must
match the field name in the letter file, and it
is automatically inserted into the letter during
each printing cycle.
</p>
<p>
<b>.cs</b> (Clear Screen)
</p>
<p>
Self explanatory &mdash; removes any previously
displayed material from the screen.
</p>
<p>
<b>.df</b> &lt;file name&gt; (Define data file name)
</p>
<p>
This indicates the name of the data file which
will be used during the MailMerge operation.
It is placed in the letter file.
</p>
<p>
<b>.dm</b> &lt;message&gt; (Display Message)
</p>
<p>
This is followed by appropriate text, which
will be displayed on the screen. It is normally
only used in a MailMerge command file.
</p>
<p>
<b>.fi</b> &lt;file name&gt; (Define file name)
</p>
<p>
MaiiMerge needs to know what file is to be
merged with the data file: .fi is followed by
the name of the letter file and the command
is usually placed in a command file.
</p>
<p>
<b>.op</b> (No page numbering)
</p>
<p>
WordStar defaults to numbering pages which
may be unnecessary &mdash; particularly for a
single page document. .op disables this
facility.
