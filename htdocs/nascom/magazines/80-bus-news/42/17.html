This compiles TESTPROG, lists it on the printer and
enables error checking to take place in the .INT file
and providing a message on the screen (the bit in
lower case, although it can be in upper case if you
want, or even omitted!).
</p>
<p>
TRACE is a useful facility which can be called upon
when a compiled CBASIC program is run using
CRUN. If TRACE is called without parameters, the
trace of execution of all lines in the program is
carried out but the extent of tracing may be altered
by including the line numbers as appropriate:
</p>
<pre>
CRUN TESTPROG TRACE 1,10 - traces the
            execution of lines 1 to 10
CRUN TESTPROG TRACE 9 - traces the
            execution of all lines
            after and including 9
CRUN TESTPROG TRACE - traces the lot!
</pre>
<h4>
Error messages
</h4>
<p>
CBASIC produces (when appropriate) both <span class="uppercase">Compiler</span>
and RUN-TIME error messages which are self
explanatory. It also produces two-letter error codes
which are expanded upon i na closely printed 6 page
appendix in the User Guide &mdash; and if the E toggle is
employed at compilation time, a little more information
is produced including an indication of the
offending line and the probable position of the error
on that line.
</p>
<p>
In spite of what the User Guide says, the simple error
messages are not immediately intelligible. When the
expanded error message is produced it says:
</p>
<pre>
ERROR SE IN LINE 123 AT POSITION 14
</pre>
<p>
OK, SE means syntax error, line 123 is the 123rd line
of the compiler listing, not statement label 123 and
position 14 means the 14th column on the screen or
printout. In fact, the error may have been caused by
something in a preceding line or by the omission of
something earlier on in the program {such as a
variable which has not been previously declared in a
DIM statement). It might be on the line which is
indicated, or even its predecessor(s), particularly if
the \ feature is used to break up a line &mdash; MORAL &mdash;
don&rsquo;t use the \ feature unless you are confident, and
for the first few trial compilations, do use the F
toggle to get hard copy of your errors.
</p>
<h4>
Conclusions
</h4>
<p>
CBASIC is not really designed for the inefficient,
impulsive or non-structured programmer, but it has
some excellent features which render it very useful
for commercial or scientific applications. Until Microsoft
dropped their absurd royalty claims on published
programs written in compiled MBASIC a
couple of years ago, it was the preferred BASIC
language used in commercial software and the CP/M
User Group library. Benchmark tests show that it is
somewhat slower in single precision arithmetic than
compiled MBASIC (but it works to nearly double the
level of precision). It appears to be more accurate in
handling numbers with several significant figures,
but I have not tested this exhaustively yet; a future
article on benchmarks will deal with this aspect and
will include comparisons of both BASICs and some
other languages (including P*SC*L and F*RTR*N)
on 80-BUS machines. Although it is not available
from Gemini, several software houses will supply it
at round about &pound;120 &mdash; about half the price of the
MBASIC interpreter. DRI&rsquo;s CB-80 which has a true
compiler currently costs about &pound;400.
</p>
<p>
All things considered, CBASIC would be an excellent
choice in terms of cost and facilities for the user who
is updating from a cassette-based to a disk-based
system for serious applications. Before committing
oneself to its purchase, it would be worthwhile
getting hold of copies of EBASIC and ERUN to see
how the idea of a semi-compiled language appeals
to your style of programming. EBASIC is said to be
compatible with CBASIC but lacks some of the more
advanced features, so EBASIC programs should run
satisfactorily on your CBASIC system.
