<h4>
Disadvantages
</h4>
<p class="indent">
1. &nbsp; For application programs chaining could
be a slower method of program management
than overlays.
</p>
<p class="indent">
2. &nbsp; Variables used in one program cannot
(usually) be passed across to the following
program.
</p>
<p class="indent">
3. &nbsp; The chain function that you use may error
if it does not process the command tail in the
same way as the CCP. For example the
command:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
COMP PROG1.COM PROG2.COM
</pre>
<p class="indent">
when issued normally would call the comparison
program COMP to compare the two
specified files. Normally the CCP would take
this command and load COMP.COM into
memory at 100H. The rest of the command
tail is placed in memory at 81H with the
command tail length at 80H. The command
tail is then scrutinized and if it contains
filenames then they are put at 5CH and 6CH
respectively. The program is then executed.
</p>
<p class="indent">
When run COMP will take a look at the two
File control blocks (FCB&rsquo;s) at 5CH and 6CH in
order to get the names of the files that it is to
compare.
</p>
<p class="indent">
So you can see from this that the chain
command will cause an error if it does not
perform all the above tasks when invoking a
program that requires information in the
command tail.
</p>

Using a simple chain module that simply read
in the COM file and executed it reaked havoc
when I chained Wordstar once. Of course the
name WS.COM was still in the default FCB at
5C from the reading operation, and so when
Wordstar took over it tried to open WS.COM
on the disk as a document file, which is no
use to anyone. I had forgotten to fill the FCB&rsquo;s
with spaces before invoking Wordstar.

<h4>
Methods of program chaining
</h4>
<p>
Of course the simplest method of all is to use a
language that has a chain command incorporated
in it. Beware here, though, for the very reasons that
are mentioned above, they may not work in all
cases.
</p>
<p>
Referring back to Dr. Dark&rsquo;s bit on
<a href="../../../34/11/text/#article2">chaining in Hisoft
Pascal</a> (80-BUS News, Vol 3. Iss 4), he gave us a
method by which programs can run each other via
the use of the $$$.SUB file (Read it to find out how)
and also suggested that any variables could be
passed across by first storing them in a disk file.
This is a nice one as it lets the CCP do all the work,
but will only work on drive A:.
</p>
<p>
I had a peep at the chain function in my ECO C
library just to get some ideas, and here are the
basics of how it works in English.
</p>
<pre>
chain(filename)

      open chain file using default FCB at 5CH.

if unable to open then error and return.

read loading routine into area just below BDOS.

set stack pointer below loading routine.

jump to loading routine.

read in chain file.

set stack pointer to BDOS -1.

Jump to program at 100H.

You should be able to find a diagram called
&lsquo;Principles of the CHAIN function&rsquo; somewhere, if
you take a look at that you will see that it represents
a memory map type illustration of what is going on
inside the computers memory.
</p>
<p>
Program 1 is an assembler routine, conceived from
the above, that will allow you to chain another
program. It is only a simple demonstration and will
only chain programs that do not expect any
information to be contained in the command tail.
You will notice that the name of the next program
is held in the routine under the label &lsquo;fcbh:&rsquo;, this
implies that the name of the next program is
known. It is possible of course to change this so
that any program can be chained from this
standard routine. This routine is deliberately
simple to demonstrate the basics, if a more
complex/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>universal routine is required then you will
have to add the code required to process the
command tail and put any valid filenames into the
default FCB&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m willingly leaving that up to you!!
</p>
<p>
You will notice that the default FCB at 5CH is filled
with spaces after the chain file has been read, this
means that Wordstar or Pen can be run without
confusing them with odd command tails.
</p>
<p>
Program 1 will run on its own for testing or may be
included in a larger program.

In my search for more information on this subject
I took a look at the Gemini Utility program
KEYCHAIN.COM written by David Parkinson, and
later modified by Richard Beal. This program
generates a COM file that, when run, will set up the
Gemini keyboard function keys and then optionally
run a named program.
