with DIAL, one for <i>PRESTEL</i> itself with the 14
character ID, and one without the ID for other
Viewdata services. (I don&rsquo;t want to give other
people my sign-on and passwords.) Never mind,
what&rsquo;s on offer is one of the most effective and
complete &lsquo;comms&rsquo; packages I&rsquo;ve seen for any
machine.

UKM720
</h2>
<p>
Always on the lookout for something new, and
browsing through the down-load section of the
CBBS London West Bulletin Board, I happened
across a revised version of UKM7 call UKM720.
Again written by David Back, this one is two
generations younger than UKM/7, and is put
together rather differently.
</p>
<p>
Instead of one huge source file, UKM720 has an
uninitialised&nbsp;.COM file, and an installation program
for a number of computers ranging from <i>Gemini</i>
GM811/813 cards through Tandy TRS80 to Epson
portables. The source file of the installation data
file is also provided so you can add routines for any
that aren&rsquo;t in the list, and of course the GM870 is
too new for the list. Actually, there&rsquo;s a small
problem here, the install program offers only 10
options, one of which is <i>Gemini</i>. If you want to
install something else, then you must delete one
from the installation data source and substitute the
new. I didn&rsquo;t want to do this, as everything there
was useful to someone, and anyway, it looks
greedy to have two <i>Gemini</i> options. I opted to
make the two <i>Gemini</i> options conditional, enclosed
in an &lsquo;IF &ndash; ELSE&rsquo; assembler directive, and you
reassemble for either option. The modified source
for the GM870 bit is published here, but remember,
if you do down load this from CBBSLW, then the
source will also require an equate somewhere to
indicate which MODEM source to assemble. Sorry
about the 8080 mnemonics, I did shove the thing
through TRANSLAT to convert it to Z80, but it
wouldn&rsquo;t assemble, so rather than spend half an
evening mucking about to find out why, I simply
added my bit in 8080 mnemonics.
</p>
<p>
This proves the advantage of having the sources in
the GM870 manual, as it was a straight copy job to
include it. The bit tests are done differently to the
manual, but there were 10 other examples in the
source showing how to do it, so no problems.
</p>
<p>
Since then I&rsquo;ve had trouble with a couple of the
more local bulletin boards which are supposed to
auto select 1200/75 or 300 baud, they just don&rsquo;t
seem to work. My first suspicion was the software,
but that was exonerated by trying different software,
which pointed to the MODEM card, but as
similar results happen with a WS2000 MODEM, I
guess the bulletin boards are at fault. DISTEL does
say (at 300 baud) that the auto select is experimental,
so there you go! [Ed. &ndash; I have used the
<i>Gemini</i> GM870 MODEM on an &lsquo;auto-select&rsquo; bulletin
board, and am pleased to say that it worked at
either rate. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t remember which
board!]
</p>
<p>
Enough for this session about MODEMs, they&rsquo;re
fun but tough on the pocket. Unlike yacking on the
phone, you don&rsquo;t tend to be aware that the minutes
are ticking away. Now there&rsquo;s another idea,
reprogram the <i>Gemini</i> SVC/IVC to tick away in
money rather than minutes at the top of the screen,
it could pick up the charges for the phone call from
DIAL. That would show just how bad on the pocket
it really is.

<h2>
Another New Goodie &ndash; Gemini BIOS V3.2
</h2>
<p>
Another new goodie has appeared from <i>Gemini</i>,
and not too tough on the wallet, all things
considered. BIOS 3.2. Those who remember SYS
will remember one of its features was the ability to
run with a selection of drives. You know, <i>Gemini</i>
DDDS on drive A and RML on drive B. Or,
substituting Teac TD55-F (double sided 80 track) for
the standard <i>Gemini</i> arrangement of the time of
Micropolis 1015-V (single sided 80 track) drives. A
lot of SYS&rsquo;es saw use for just this purpose, limited
though the feature was. BIOS 3.2, which is only
eighteen months late, supercedes and exceeds
SYS for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
Over a period of time, <i>Gemini</i> have gone through
four disk formats, GEMSDSS, GEMDDDS, GEM-QDSS
and GEMQDDS; at the same time less
significant features of the BlOSes has been
improved, changed, added or just done away with.
One such improvement is again associated with
drives. Early <i>Gemini</i> BIOSes know nothing about
RAM-disks, later versions you hand patch to turn
them on, and the latest finds out for itself what&rsquo;s
there and turns it on for you. Likewise, if you
upgrade your drives, to a different format, the BIOS
has to be changed to suit. <i>Gemini</i> would always do
this for you, but the number of permutations is
getting out of hand. All arguments for a different
way of doing things, hence BIOS 3.2.
</p>
<p>
BIOS 3.2 consists of a full feature BIOS, (one or
more of several versions being supplied depending
on your current CP/M or system, one called
BIOSF.SYS (for the floppy drive only version), a
BIOSFW.SYS (for a floppy as the boot drive plus
Winchester drivers, BIOSW.SYS (for the winnie and
floppy version), and BIOSN.SYS for MultiNet
systems), a system configuration file, a serialized
CP/M core with the <i>Gemini</i> version of CCPZ, and a
CP/M constructor called GENSYS. The system
