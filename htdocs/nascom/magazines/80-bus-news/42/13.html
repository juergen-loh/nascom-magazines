<p>
nasty Beeb programs! An additional, useful facility
is that text can be put after the backslash &mdash; a subtle
form of REM, and, as in MBASIC, two or more
statements on one line must be separated by a
colon.
</p>
<pre>
IF REPT = 0 \ Check for repetition
THEN GOTO 999: PRINT"REPEATING TEST"
</pre>
<p>
The statement can start anywhere on the line &mdash; but
it is obviously better to use the first 80 columns.
</p>
<h4>
Data I/O
</h4>
<p>
Both BASICs use the conventional PRINT statement
with semi-colon or comma separators; in CBASIC,
the comma indicates a move to the next printing
field which is every 20th print position and the
semi-colon leaves one space after the last printed
item and then starts printing again. PRINT USING,
WIDTH and TAB are also supported by both but 3
statements, LPRINTER, CONSOLE and POS are
specific to CBASIC. LPRINTER directs all PRINT
statement output to the printer until it is cancelled
by the CONSOLE statement which routes it back to
the screen. LPRINTER assumes a print WIDTH of
132 characters unless a lower figure is set (e.g. 80):
</p>
<pre>
LPRINTER WIDTH 80
</pre>
<p>
CONSOLE assumes a screen width of 80 characters
unless otherwise directed.
</p>
<p>
The POS function is used to identify how many
characters have been printed or displayed on a line
&mdash; useful if you want to see how much space
remains. I haven&rsquo;t used this facility very often!
</p>
<h4>
File handling
</h4>
<p>
in CBASIC there are two types of file, sequential
and relative. Their use is rather more straightforward
than in MBASIC. The sequential file type is
better in terms of disk space usage but the relative
file can be read or written to at random since it
assigns a fixed space to each possible record. The
following remarks apply broadly to both types of
file but OPENing or CREATEing relative files
involves the RECL parameter in which the record
length must be specified:
</p>
<pre>
100 OPEN &ldquo;A: ADDRESS .LIS&rdquo; RECL 128 AS 3
</pre>
<p>
Files are opened using CREATE, OPEN or FILE
statements and closed by CLOSE (and CHAIN or
STOP if these statements occur in a program).
CREATE, as its name suggests, sets up a new file,
deleting any previous file with the same name,
OPEN &mdash; well, it just opens a file which has already
been created in the directory. FILE is very useful
since it will CREATE a new file and OPEN it if it does
not currently exist &mdash; and it will OPEN a file for I/O
if it exists. All these commands can be used to
operate more than one file at a time.
</p>
<p>
OPEN and CREATE have the same syntax, but FILE
does not need the identifier to be specified &mdash; it
does this automatically:
</p>
<pre>
OPEN "B: TEDIOUS.DOC" AS 2
CREATE "A: TEST.DOC AS 1
FILE "A: DAVEHUNTSBITS"
</pre>
<p>
in the first two cases, a file and drive are specified
and given a numeric identifier &mdash; thus TEDIOUS.DOC
was originally set up on disk B and has
the identifier 2 &mdash; which will be used for subsequent
file operations using READ # and PRINT
#:<br>
the file on drive A called DAVEHUNTSBITS will be
assigned 3 as its identifier if it was in the same
program; this is because it is the third file to be
specified.
</p>
<pre>
READ #2:A$ - reads string variable
                A$ from file 2 which in
                this example, is TEDIOQUS.DOC
PRINT #1;A$ - writes the same string
                variable to file 1 &ndash; TEST.DOC
</pre>
<p>
PRINT USING # is a very useful facility if you have
a number of different types of output format to
include; both PRINT # and PRINT USING # are
limited to a maximum number of 20 file identifiers!
To CLOSE a file, simply type CLOSE &lt;file identifier&gt;
&mdash; very neat and just like MBASIC.
</p>
<p>
Other useful statements are DELETE &lt;identifier&gt;
which enables one to delete files when they are no
longer required in a program and INITIALIZE which
allows one to change a disk without causing the
system to become bewildered or risking the
scrambling of directories. One can also RENAME a
file, determine its SIZE in 1&nbsp;Kbyte increments, or
employ the IF END # statement to do something
mind-boggling when the contents of a file have
been read and Marvin or whatever you call your
machine is about to become seriously confused!
</p>
<pre>
RENAME (NEWFILENAMES$,OLDFILENAME$)
PRINT SIZE("FILENAME$"}
IF END  2 THEN 999 \STOP THE PROGRAM
</pre>
<p>
CBASIC defaults to a record length of 128 bytes for
RECL; additionally, one can specify the data buffer
length and sector length using the BUFF and RECS
parameters; these follow the numeric file identifier.
Further information on file handling can be gleaned
from the Guide.

<h4>
Numerical operations
</h4>
<p>
The major differences between the two BASICs are
in the field of relational operators (less than,
greater than etc.). The conventional combinations
of &lt;, &gt; and = are supplemented by letters:
