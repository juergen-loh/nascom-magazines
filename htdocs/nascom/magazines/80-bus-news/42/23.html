transformer is sampled via a high impedance pad
and fed to an LM386, which is a small audio
amplifier. An 8R speaker output is thus provided to
monitor the line. Useful if you keep dialing
engaged numbers or keep finding noisy lines. A
software on/off switch is provided for the audio
output, and the audio level is adjustable from zero
to full volume using a preset pot. Maximum audio
output was not measured, but was certainly loud
enough!

<h4>
The Computer Hardware
</h4>
<p>
So on to the system side of the hardware, the bit
the computer side of the coupling transformer and
isolator. It&rsquo;s an 8&Prime; x 8&Prime; bus card like all the rest, and
the height of the coupling transformer and line
inductor are such that the card will fit in to a normal
Vero frame or the reduced pitch (0.95&Prime;) Gemini
frame used in the Galaxy series computers. The
major interface devices are a CTC, a PIO and a
DART. The CTC and the PIO were familiar, the
DART was a new one on me, and unfortunately
little detail was provided about any of these
devices in the manual. Not a problem as we shall
see, but unusual, as Gemini manuals tend to go
into detail describing unfamiliar devices. The usual
I/O buffers were provided, handing the usual bus
signals and providing NASIO. More typical of
present technology, I/O decoding was provided by
a PAL rather than discrete logic, with no options for
alternative addressing. The board uses 12 ports,
from 80h to 8bh, which overlaps the Belectra
Arithmetic card. This I understand is due to a
Gemini &lsquo;internal communications failure&rsquo; as the
decoding was intended to be 84h to 8fh. Not that
it matters as the Belectra card may be re-addressed
and the dedicated software for the Belectra card
may also be re-addressed.
</p>
<p>
Three of the four counters of the CTC are used for
internal clock signals, two for the DART Rx and Tx
clocks, and one to control the dialling. The PIO
device does most of the card control, and all 16 bits
are used. Port A produces a 3 x 4 matrix which is
directed to the dialling decoded (effectively it
pretends it&rsquo;s a numeric key pad of a telephone).
Port B pulls in the relays as required and selects the
MODEM chip mode. The DART I don&rsquo;t know a lot
about, except that it is a dual UART of some kind.
Only one side is used, the same register decode is
used for status in either direction and another port
for data either direction.
</p>
<p>
Dialling is quite sneaky, it uses a Mostek telephone
dialling chip, which is normally used with &lsquo;touchdialling&rsquo;
phones. Give it a matrix of numbers and
it just gets on with it. Board tracking is included for
tone dialling to CCITT standards using a second
Mostek chip, but this chip and crystal are not
provided. This means the MODEM may be
equipped for use with UK tone dialling PABX
switch boards as well as the normal direct line
connect.
</p>
<p>
The guts of the matter revolves around the
MODEM chip, I haven&rsquo;t got the full words for this
device (I borrowed and read the words some time
ago) and information in the MODEM manual is
sparse (like the CTC, PIO and DART). This chip is
the all laughing dancing singing thingy capable of
CCITT and BELL protocols. This is all controlled by
five address lines, the first two being connected to
the PIO, the remainder being returned to patch
plugs which are sealed with paint. Now the words
say that if you remove and change the links, the
card will be forced to work outside <i>BT</i> regulations,
which translated means it will start working in the
BELL mode. What the manual does not say is what
exactly happens when you do swop the plugs
about. So for that you need the AMD manual.
What&rsquo;s on offer with the standard setup as
supplied:
</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr><td>V.21 300/300</td><td>originate</td><td>full duplex</td></tr>
<tr><td>V.21 300/300</td><td>answer   </td><td>full duplex</td></tr>
<tr><td>V.23 75/1200</td><td>originate</td><td>asymmetrical duplex</td></tr>
<tr><td>V.23 1200/75</td><td>answer   </td><td>asymmetrical duplex</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is standard for most things found in the UK,
and the likelihood of BELL protocols being encountered
is remote.
</p>
<p>
On test a strange anomoly has been observed
which must be something to do with the hardware.
I wonder if it has occurred elsewhere? I haven&rsquo;t
looked into it yet, but it goes as follows:
</p>
<p class="exdent">
Conditions:<br>
Computer mains off but not unplugged from
mains<br>
MODEM connected to line (plug in socket)
Video recorder on play back in another room
Incoming call, phone ringing
</p>
<p>
<p class="exdent">
Ringing &lsquo;burr&rsquo; heard quite loudly from the TV
set when an incoming call occurs??? Now, as
I say I haven&rsquo;t looked for it, I just unplug the
MODEM when not in use, but I haven&rsquo;t the
foggiest idea what causes it!!
</p>
<h4>
The Manual
</h4>
<p>
A pretty comprehensive manual is supplied which
runs to 52 pages, and covers all the major aspects
of the card and its software. Details are missing
about the I/O devices used, referring you to the
respective device manuals. Instead of blow by blow
accounts of the devices used, source listings of the
setup and I/O procedures are provided. As can be
imagined, with a PIO, a CTC and DART to set up,
the routines are complicated and tedious. With the
source listings provided, they can all be seen and
analysed. These are much more useful than
accounts of the workings of the chips. The
