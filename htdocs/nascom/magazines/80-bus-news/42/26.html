configuration file is edited with a text editor to suit
the drive configuration required, and the whole lot
put together with GENSYS which goes to the BIOS
file and pulls out the bits it wants. GENSYS then
gives you the option of putting the results on to a
system track or saving it as a file for use with
SYSGEN later. The attraction from Gemini&rsquo;s point
of view is that when significant changes have been
made to the BIOS or new permutations of drive and
format take effect, all they have to do is issue new
versions of BIOSx.SYS and everyone can reap the
benefit without all the hassle of having to send
disks back to Gemini for upgrade.
</p>
<p>
So what does BIOS 3.2 offer? Apart from all the
drive permutation twiddles, basically all the normal
Gemini features, screen editing, screen dump, etc.
Also the usual I/O byte support for serial and
parallel printers, serial transmission protocols and
all the rest. Nothing radically new, just the latest
versions with extensions to the patch area so that
all three different IVC/SVC cursor types may be
defined, and screen edit mode may now be
disabled.
</p>
<p>
The fun really starts around the drives. If BIOSFW
or BIOSW for winnies is included, then the winnie
can be partitioned as required, for instance you
could make five 1M drives out of 5M winnie (I can&rsquo;t
think why you should want to, but you can) or,
more usefully, for example an 8M and a 2M out of
a 10M winnie (8M being the maximum CP/M 2.2
can address).
</p>
<p>
The permutations of drives can be fun, one
problem with SYS was that you couldn&rsquo;t easily mix
drive types beyond 5&Prime; 48 tpi with 8&Prime;, or 5&Prime; 96 tpi
with 8&Prime;. So mixtures of 48 tpi and 96 tpi were out
as you couldn&rsquo;t make SYS double step 96 tpi drives
to read 48 tpi formats. With BIOS 3.2 you can. The
menu is impressive for home use, yet not powerful
enough to make any competition to Gemini&rsquo;s own
MFB series of machines. All the past and present
Gemini formats are supported, naturally, that&rsquo;s
both 96 and 48 tpi double density and the original
double sided single sided GM805 format. Additionally,
Superbrain 48 tpi single sided, <i>IBM</i>&nbsp;PC 48 tpi
single and double sided 8 sector formats, DEC
Rainbow, both Nascom formats and dear old
fashioned 8&Prime; single sided single density. What&rsquo;s
more you can assign more than one logical drive
assignment to one physical drive. So for a person
like me who gets a lot of disks in various Gemini
formats, the following works a treat.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr><td>Logical Drive A:</td><td colspan=2>Gemini 5M winnie</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical Drive B:</td><td>Gemini QDDS</td><td>Physical drive 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical Drive C:</td><td>Gemini QDDS</td><td>Physical drive 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical Drive D:</td><td>Gemini DDDS</td><td>Physical drive 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical Drive E:</td><td>Gemini SDDS</td><td>Physical drive 1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
By sticking disks in either drive 0 or drive 1 as
appropriate, I can copy anything that comes my
way to either the other drive or the winnie.
Similarly, if people expect things returned, I can
copy stuff back to their original disks with no
problem. The only problem comes when formatting
disks, BIOS 3.2 does not supply a format
program which will pick up the disk dph&rsquo;s and
format to the standard in current use by the drive.
Pity that, I&rsquo;d have loved to have sent this disk to
Paul in say DEC Rainbow format and then see how
long it would take him to sus what I&rsquo;d done. Never
mind, I&rsquo; invent a wierd format of my own using
ALLDISC, that should fox him completely and give
Gemini&rsquo;s new MFB2 something to get upset over.

BIOS 3.2 is even more intelligent than it already
appears. Lets take an instance where you are using
a 96 tpi machine to construct a system track for a
48 tpi machine. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a lot of good if the
result sent to disk was 96 tpi, as the 48 tpi drives
couldn&rsquo;t read it. No if the BIOS constructed is a 48
tpi BIOS, then GENSYS will write the result to
either a 48 tpi drive or double step (still equalling 48
tpi) to a 96 tpi drive, the boot sector being correctly
set up for the 48 tpi format. This brings me to the
second big feature of BIOS 3.2. Each physical drive
can be specified separately. One drive could be an
8&Prime; for instance, another, a double sided 96 tpi with
3ms head stepping and no head load delays,
another, a 96 tpi single sided with 20mS head
stepping and 50mS head load delay and spectacularly
long head settle times, whilst yet another
drive could be a double sided 48 tpi drive with
10mS head stepping and no head delays. A
maximum of four physical drive may be specified
by type 8&Prime; or 5&Prime;, the number of tracks per inch, the
number of tracks. the number of sides, the step,
head settle and load times.
</p>
<p>
BIOS 3.2 expects you to be logical about your
logical to physical drive assignments, it no good
specifying 96 tpi formats to a 48 tpi drive for
instance, on the other hand it a 48 tpi format is
specified to a 96 tpi drive, then the drive is forced
to double step to read and write like a 48 tpi.
</p>
<p>
Reading 48 tpi disks with a 96 tpi drive works well,
writing needs care, as the disk should be wiped
clean with a magnet and reformatted using the 96
tpi drive before data is written, using the 96 tpi
drive (hence the need for the format program). This
is because the heads of a 48 tpi drive are wider than
those of a 96 tpi drive and therefore track a wider
area. If a disk previously written using a 48 tpi drive
is rewritten using a 96 tpi drive, there will be areas
of the original 48 tpi recording left between the
tracks recorded by the double stepping 96 tpi drive.
When the disk is placed in the 48 tpi drive, the head
will track both the intended track recorded by the
96 tpi drive, and also the residual crud left from the
original 48 tpi recording. This will degrade the
signal to noise ratio, often to the degree that the
disk can not be read.
