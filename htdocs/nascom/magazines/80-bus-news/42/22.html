with enough software to suit all but the most
fastidious user. The board is the usual high quality
8&Prime; x 8&Prime; card, with a fair sprinkling of big chips and
some miniature relays as well. This all comes with
the documentation, a lead fitted with the &lsquo;new-type&rsquo;
<i>BT</i> rectangular plugs to connect it to the phone and
a disk with enough &lsquo;comms&rsquo; software to keep most
users quiet for a long time. In fact everything you
need to plug it in and go.

<h4>
The Line Side
</h4>
<p>
Close examination of the board reveals good
adherence to the <i>BT</i> ideas of line isolation using
both a line transformer (to the more rigid <i>BT</i> 5KV
spec.) for line coupling and an opto-isolator for
ringing detection. The whole area of the board
associated with the phone line part is ringed by a
heavy earth track, and a plate through M3 hole is
provided for the isolating earth. Tracking is
provided for spark gaps, but these are missing, the
manual emphasizing that the system is for
connection as a secondary device within the <i>BT</i>
&lsquo;new-type&rsquo; six pole plug and socket scheme. If the
MODEM is connected as a secondary, then it is
protected by the spark gaps in the primary socket,
but with proliferation of diy telephone wiring, there
is always the danger of someone doing a short cut
job and not using a primary socket for the phone
input. This danger is also present if the MODEM
were connected direct to the older type <i>BT</i> wiring
and the original phone removed. Three fuses are
provided, one each on the A and B pair, and a third
on the bell suppress line. I&rsquo;ve never seen one there
before, but useful none-the-less.
</p>
<p>
Having said that the board appears to adhere to <i>BT</i>
specs. with regard to the line side of the board, why
the big red triangle saying &lsquo;Not approved for ...
etc.&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>
Well here lies an interesting story, typical of the
muddle headed thinking which tends to go with big
bureaucracy. A few years ago, with the idea that <i>BT</i>
was to go public, HMG considered the business of
<i>BT</i> approval. <i>BT</i> could hardly carry out the
approvals itself as this could smack of monopoly,
and the only one allowed to run monopolies is
HMG. So the approval was farmed off to an
independent body, BABT, the British Approvals
Board for Telecommunications, along with draft
specs. from <i>BT</i>. It appears they also had a brief to
tighten the specs. a bit and were to be allowed to
charge for approval (expenses you know}. So BABT
beavered away, and did what it was told and
tightened the specs.
</p>
<p>
Now what follows is hear-say, but sounds rather
likely. When <i>BT</i> heard what BABT had done, and
this was before BABT got hold of the approval
monopoly, <i>BT</i> hastily rushed through a few
projects of their own. Could this batch of approvals
have included the &lsquo;new-type&rsquo; telephone socket, as
by no means would that socket get BABT approval
now. For starters, you can shove the British
Standard finger into it, and the ringing voltage is
150 volts!! Oh dear, oh dear.
</p>
<p>
Another bit of spec. tightening involved the
situation of MODEM cards. They don&rsquo;t actually
approve a card any more, they approve the card
and the system it will live in. So we have the very
odd situation where the Gemini GM870 meets the
spec., so the card will actually get (or by the time
you see this, maybe have got) approval; BUT, only
when fitted in a specified Gemini machine by
Gemini themselves. Under any other circumstances
the card is not approved, and unless you
submit your own system, including the card, and
fork out quite a bit of loot, the card will never have
approval in your system. Even more wierd, if
Gemini made the card stand-alone, with its own
PSU and serial interface, and put the lot in a pretty
box, then it would likely gain approval, despite the
fact that you might have the live side of the mains
connected to system ground! So stand-alone
MODEMs get approval. Built-in MODEM cards
don&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p>
So what&rsquo;s the point, why sell an unapproved
MODEM? None really, it&rsquo;s not illegal to sell them,
and it&rsquo;s up to the conscience of the purchaser who
buys and uses it. The red triangle notice only says
&lsquo;... action MAY be taken ... &rsquo; and <i>BT</i> are fully aware
of the situation regarding the use of non-approved
phones in this country. If someone were mad
enough to try and make a stand on the matter, the
courts would be tied up from here to kingdom
come with petty flouting of <i>BT</i> regulations, and
no-one in authority likes to see the law made a fool
of, least of all <i>BT</i>. So provided the card does
everything it needs to to ensure it&rsquo;s safety, and
provided you have done everything to ensure that
your system is electrically safe, and provided the
MODEM doesn&rsquo;t draw attention to itself by acting
in an unapproved fashion (which it won&rsquo;t}, then the
chances of being done for using it are vanishingly
small. Not that I would encourage anyone to flout
<i>BT</i> regulations, it&rsquo;s up to you.
</p>
<p>
To finish off the coupling arrangements the line
transformer is coupled to the AMD 7910 &lsquo;World
Series&rsquo; MODEM chip via a terminating pad for
output, and via a 741 op-amp with carefully
controlled gain to reduce the input on V.21
operation, thereby improving the integrity of the
signal. No in-line filtering is incorporated, as the
AMD 7910 includes its own line filtering, although
I have a sneeking suspicion that the inclusion of a
bandpass filter may improve the performance
under marginal conditions. That said, none of the
other MODEMs in the same price bracket using the
AMD chip include bandpass filtering, nor the gain
control, so the performance should be at least as
good as the competition, and possibly better on
V.21 due to the gain controlled amplifier. The
