WHILE/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>WEND loops can be nested in the same way

<h4>
&lsquo;Subroutines&rsquo;
</h4>
<p>
The use of GOSUB...RETURN as a form of
&lsquo;subroutine&rsquo; in BASIC has been the subject of much
hot air and plonking arguments, culminating in the
DEFPROC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>PROC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>ENDPROC to be found in BBC
BASIC. If used properly, there is nothing wrong
with GOSUB, whether straight or computed.
CBASIC has an additional feature over MBASIC and
this is the multiple-line function. This clever device
enables those who are allergic to the use of GOSUB
to define the &lsquo;subroutine&rsquo; function as follows: (note
the full stop between the FN and the dummy
argument)
</p>
<pre>
DEF FN.CROSS.SECTION(AREA)
</pre>
<p>
In this case, the function name {in this case,
CROSS.SECTION) is followed by a dummy argument,
AREA, which is a real numeric variable used
within the function and CROSS SECTION is treated
as a variable which may have values assigned to it
within the function itself &mdash; in this way, values of
variables needed within the &lsquo;subroutine&rsquo; can be
input without the need to define them in assignments.
Constants or expressions cannot be used as
dummy arguments &mdash; only variables can be used in
this way. The variable can be a string, integer or
real type and is treated as local to the function, and
only able to be modified within the function. The
function must be terminated with a RETURN,
followed by FEND; FEND is not executed under
normal circumstances but if RETURN is missed out,
then CRUN will send an error message and return
to CP/M.
</p>
<p>
Initially, the use of multiple line functions seems a
little difficult but with experience, the advantages
of the facility become apparent. Essentially, the
CBASIC function follows the FORTRAN method.
The User Guide is reasonably clear on the use of
this type of function, and provides some examples
of its application.

<h4>
Overlaying and Chaining
</h4>
<p>
In spite of the suggestive names, these have
nothing at all to do with S<?php spChar("starf"); ?>X, kinky or otherwise!
Overlaying is employed when a program is too big
to fit into the available memory; the program is
broken down into smaller units, called overlays and
these are stored as separate, compiled programs.
An overlay is called when the previous program
reaches a CHAIN statement which explicity names
the overlay in question before it completes its
execution. The new overlay can end by calling yet
another overlay, or the previous one or even by
stopping program execution. Two important points
should be borne in mind before using overlays in
CBASIC.
</p>
<ol class="indent">
<li>An overlay overwrites the previous
program but the previously used program
can pass data to the overlay by
means of COMMON statements which
leave the data in memory; these COMMON
statements must be in both the
calling program and overlay.</li>
<li>Memory usage is slightly restricted
by the use of overlays; full details of
this are to be found in the CBASIC User
Guide.</li>
</ol>
<p>
CHAINing allows COMMON variables to remain
intact while the area of memory used for storage of
file buffers, strings and arrays is compacted. If the
%CHAIN directive is used, the system cunningly
instructs the first of a series of programs to
determine the maximum storage capacity of all
following program overlays; this maximum figure
will be used to determine how much memory will
be allocated to each of the areas required by the
program suite.
</p>
<p>
In its simplest form, CHAIN is used as follows:
</p>
<pre>
REM FINISH PREVIOUS PROGRAM THEN
REM LOAD NEXT OVERLAY
CHAIN "NEWPROG"
</pre>
<p>
An arrangement which allows an overlay to be
loaded from a different disk drive follows; this
assumes that the logged in drive is A and that the
next program resides on drive B:
</p>
<pre>
DISK.DRIVE$ = "B:"
INPUT"NAME OF NEXT PROGRAM";PROGRAM.NAME$
CHAIN DISK.DRIVE$+PROGRAM.NAME$
</pre>
<p>
The COMMON statement is not found in other
BASICs, and its use follows the FORTRAN precedent
as being the first statement in a program,
agreeing in type and sequence in both sending and
receiving programs. Thus if variables A, B$ and C%
are produced by the sending program, the receiving
program must have either the same variables in
the same order or different named variables of the
same type in the same order, i.e. X, Y$ and Z%.
</p>
<p>
Array variables in COMMON must be followed by
one parameter which specifies the number of array
subscripts, and these must appear in a DIMension
statement.
