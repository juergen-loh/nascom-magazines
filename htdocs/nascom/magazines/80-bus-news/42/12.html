entered using a text editor such as ED (if you must),
WordStar or PEN. From the source code program
(which must have the extension type&nbsp;.BAS), it
produces an&nbsp;.INT file in which, for example, &lsquo;PRINT&rsquo;
is stored as 1Ah. The logic behind this is that it
takes a shorter time to interpret 1 byte such as 1A
when the semi-compiled program is run than it
does to deal with 5 letters as in PRINT. To use the
language, you need to:
</p>
<p>
1. Write a CBASIC source program.
</p>
<p>
2. Use CBASIC to produce the intermediate
(.INT) file.
</p>
<p>
3. Use CRUN to execute the&nbsp;.INT file.
</p>
<p>
CRUN is a run-time interpreter which takes the INT
file produced by CBASIC after checking the source
code for errors, and converts it to machine code.
The pseudo-code compiler/run-time interpreter
combination is a compromise between the readily
alterable but slow-running interpreted and the
fast-running but not easily alterable compiled
versions of BASIC.
</p>
<p>
The same procedure could be used for EBASIC,
which, I believe, is available as Public Domain
software at a very modest charge from the CP/M
Users Group.
</p>
<p>
CBASIC appears to be more cumbersome in use
than MBASIC, but it has a number of very useful
features which the latter lacks. The major use for it
has been in the field of business applications
software where its speed of execution and facilities
have been most favoured. Unfortunately, it is only
available for disk-based CP/M systems.
</p>
<p>
The language takes a little getting used to and I
would not recommend it to anyone who has less
than a good grasp of BASIC: until one is reasonably
familiar with its syntax and little peculiarities, it is
best not to use some of the more advanced
features. In the following pages, I have attempted
to provide some information on CBASIC and
MBASIC (disk version) statements and commands,
where they differ or where they are peculiar to
CBASIC. CBASIC has an excellent, if expensive
User Guide by A. Osborne, G. Eubanks and M.
McNiff, published by Osborne/McGraw-Hill in
1981. It is rather costly at &pound;12 (in 1983) for 215
pages but is essential for the serious user. The
Guide deals with version 2.07 of the compiler; I
have used version 2.02 only, but I have not found
any major problems or incompatibilities. The
version number of the run-time interpreter CRUN
used in the book is not stated but mine was 2.04.
</p>
<p>
Data types
</p>
<p>
Both BASICs support integer and floating point
(real) numbers, with exponential notation for the
latter. The range for integers is the same in both
(4.32767 to -32768), but real numbers are stored by
CBASIC with an accuracy of 14 digits, compared
</p>
<p>
with 7 for single precision and 17 for double
precision MBASIC. Exponential range for MBASIC
is 2.9387E-38 to 1.70141E38, whereas CBASIC has
a range from 9.9999999999999E62 to 1.0E-64,
which could be very useful!! Both BASICs allow
hexadecimal notation, but CBASIC allows binary
and MBASIC permits octal notation in addition. All
three are, of course, special ways of representing
integer numeric data in BASIC.
</p>
<p>
Names of variables may be up to 31 characters
long in CBASIC; although in MBASIC they can be of
any length, only the first two alphanumeric
characters are recognized; some characters are not
allowed but who wants to use *,!,@ or &amp; in a
variable name? Both BASICs use the $ sign to
denote string variables, and integers may be
explicitly declared. This is done in CBASIC by
adding a % sign to the end of the variable name
(with not more than 30 preceding characters}; in
MBASIC, the DEFINT statement does this. The
ability to use variable names like &lsquo;microcomputer&rsquo;,
&lsquo;collywobble&rsquo; or &lsquo;knightsbridge&rsquo; may appeal to the
whimsical but unfortunately, &lsquo;supercalifragilistiexpialidocious&rsquo;
is too long and would be truncated!
Variable names should be distinct and descriptive,
which will help you understand the flow of each
program you write.
</p>
<p>
DiMension statements have virtually the same
functions in both BASICs; a little appreciated fact is
that it is possible to use a constant or a variable to
declare the highest subscript for an array or vector:
</p>
<p>
2350
DIM SORTCODE$ (ZZ) , HOUSENUMBER (2)
</p>
<p>
or
</p>
<p>
23(1}=50
Zh (2)=5
DIM SORTCODENUMBERS$ (2Z(1),2%(2))
</p>
<p>
Statement construction
</p>
<p>
Line numbers are optional in CBASIC except where
the line is referenced by a statement elsewhere in
the program. An additional and somewhat bizarre
feature is that the numbers can be in any format &mdash;
integer, real or exponent, but there must be less
than 31 digits.
</p>
<p>
A single CBASIC statement can be spread over
several lines by the use of the backslash (\) and
lower case letters are converted to upper case
unless the &lsquo;D&rsquo; toggle is used.
</p>
<p>
IF REPT = 0 \
THEN GOTO 999
</p>
<p>
There seems to be no limit to the length of a
statement but keep it within reasonable bounds
otherwise your source will look like one of those
