<u>Final issue</u>
</h2>
<p>
Please note that we intend the
final <a href="../text/"></a>issue of 80-BUS news to be a
little silly. (Yes, OK, I know that
virtually every issue has been
silly, but that&rsquo;s not what I mean.)
</p>
<p>
If you have any Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini etc
related tales that you think will
give other readers a chuckle then
please send them in. Nothing
libellous though please!
</p>
<p>
You might like to relate an
anecdote on the troubles you have
had building up your system,
getting to grips with software,
mis-understandings with the Mrs.,
or how YOU had to explain to the
dealer what a RAM chip is!
</p>
<p>
I can certainly remember certain
things; like the user who soldered
his Nascom&nbsp;1 together with all the
components on the wrong side of the
board. And another who melted a
load of solder in a frying pan, and
then dipped his Nascom&nbsp;1 into it to
&ldquo;flow solder&rdquo; it!!

An introduction to CBASIC
</h2>
<h3>
by P.D.Coker

<p>
CBASIC is one of several dialects of BASIC
available to users of 80-BUS machines. It originated
from the fertile mind of Gordon Eubanks Jr.
and first became available to micro users in 1977,
quickly followed by an enhanced version, CBASIC2
in the latter part of 1978. Dr Eubanks had developed
the idea of a type of compiled BASIC as part of his
doctoral research, soon after CP/M had been
released on an unsuspecting public, and this
became known as EBASIC but has now been
almost completely superseded by CBASIC which
has many enhancements and is more suitable for
programming purposes. CBASIC2 was originally a
product of Compiler Systems Inc., the firm which
Eubanks founded in California but is now under the
tender care of <i>Digital Research Inc.</i> In this article,
CBASIC refers to the second release, CBASIC2. An
expensive but versatile version including a true
&lsquo;native code&rsquo; compiler, known as CB-80 is also
available from DAl.

<p>
Most people will have heard of Microsoft BASIC
(MBASIC) in one or other of its forms, and once one
becomes familiar with the quirks and deficiencies
of the particular version one has available, one&rsquo;s
style of programming adapts accordingly. So why
bother about another version of BASIC? Certainly,
for many purposes, MBASIC performs quite adequately
as an interpreted language, with the option of
a compiler, while CBASIC is a &lsquo;pseudo-code&rsquo;
compiled (sometimes known as &lsquo;semi-compiled&rsquo;)
language.
</p>
<p>
Unlike compilers, interpreted BASICs allow the
programmer to develop and test sections of a
program immediately using the built-in line editing
facility, and syntax or other errors can be spotted
when the program or segment is RUN. On-screen
editing is available to enable offending lines to be
corrected. Additionally, MBASIC has a means of
compacting the code as it is entered, to save time
and memory when the program is executed. From
almost every point of view, a satisfactory situation.
What are the drawbacks to this paragon of
virtuosity? Essentially, the interpreter has to
evaluate each line as it is executed, and this can
slow down the execution speed of programs which
handle large amounts of data or, more importantly,
those in which loops or calls to subroutines, more
familiarly known as &lsquo;GOSUB ... RETURN&rsquo; occur.
This can be significantly changed by converting the
program after it has been fully tested in to a
&lsquo;compiled&rsquo; form, where the program is efficiently
compacted and (in a true compiler), converted into
machine code instructions. CBASIC does not have
a true compiler, but instead produces an efficiently
packed code from a source program which is
