An optional facility for use with BIOS 3.2 is a utility
called IBMCOPY. Now this program allows a
system that can cope with 48 tpi, 40 track single or
double sided disks to initialise, read and write, <i>IBM</i>&nbsp;PC
8 sector or 9 sector, single or double sided,
PCDOS disks. This will be of great use to people
who have a PCDOS machine at work, and a Gemini
at home, as they will be able to transfer data to and
from those different machines, or even to Superbrain
or DEC! Remember though that the PCDOS
programs themselves will be of little use, unless
you have a Gemini GM888 board and have
implemented PCDOS on that.

BIOS 3.2 has been supplied with standard Gemini
CP/M&rsquo;s from about June this year. Owners of
earlier CP/M&rsquo;s can get theirs upgraded by returning
their original Gemini master disk to their dealer
who will return it to Gemini for upgrade. Cost
&pound;30.00 plus VAT.
