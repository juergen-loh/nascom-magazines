<?php columnStart(1, "noindent"); ?>
<p>
available as CTRL/W, and LF is available as CTRL/J. Whether [ \ ] and { | }
are shifted or unshifted depends on the Keyboard option. With these changes,
the full ASCII character set is still available from the keyboard.
</p>
<h4>
b) Parallel printer support
</h4>
<p>
Upon power-up or reset, the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> is initialized. Printer output is activated by
the U command, and deactivated by the N command. This is made possible by a
change in the workspace initialisation, $UOUT will initially point to the
printer driver routine. Initial contents of $UOUT: C3 CB 04
</p>
<h4>
c) New NAS-SYS commands
</h4>
<p>
Two new NAS-SYS commands are provided:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><u>L</u></dt><dd><u>PRINT</u></dd>
</dl>
<p>
The contents of the accumulator are sent to the printer, using the printer
driver routine. Please note that this command is independent of the N and U
commands, working always. If the accumulator contains code &pound;0A, data will not
be sent to printer, code &pound;0D will be sent to the printer as &pound;0A. The printer
must be on line, or the routine will make the Nascom hang up. This command is
best used as a subroutine call in programs:
</p>
<p class="indent">
&pound;DF &pound;4C PRINT &nbsp; &nbsp; Sends contents of A to printer.
</p>
<p>
<u>F aa bb cc dd ....</u> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u class="uppercase">Send</u> <u class="uppercase">Arguments</u> <u class="uppercase">To</u> <u class="uppercase">Printer</u>
</p>
<p>
Up to ten hexadecimal arguments following the command are converted to 8-bit
data and sent to the printer. If arguments &gt;&pound;FF are specified, only the least
significant byte is sent. Please note that this command is independent of the
N and U commands, working always. The printer must be on line, or the command
will make the Nascom hang up. As this command uses the printer driver routine,
arguments of &pound;0A will be ignored, and arguments of &pound;0D will be converted to
&pound;0A. This command is very useful for sending control codes to the printer, for
example to activate or deactivate emphasized or enlarged print mode.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Using modified NAS-SYS and printer with standard Nascom firmware</u>
</h3>
<h4>
a) NAS-SYS
</h4>
<p class="indent">
Printer on &ndash; U command<br>
Printer off &ndash; N command
</p>
<p>
The user is in direct communication with the printer, that is, everything that
is typed on the keyboard will be sent to the printer. Line feeds are ignored.
Carriage returns will be sent as line feeds.
</p>
<h4>
b) NASPEN
</h4>
<p>
For the P command to function, the printer reflection must be changed:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
101D    DF 4C C9   SCAL "L   RET
</pre>
<h4>
c) DEBUG
</h4>
<p>
DEBUG uses the NAS-SYS $UOUT jump, and therefore turns off the printer when
started. Use these DEBUG commands to control the printer:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Printer on &ndash; :C 04CB<br>
Printer off &ndash; :C C143
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
