80-BUS &lsquo;Pluto&rsquo; colour board from IO Research. The number of permutations of
this board should be the subject of an article of its own! Started off with
on-board 5MHz 8088 processor, 640x288 resolution, 8 colours, two screens.
Then there were 640x576 options, 8MHz options, and the current product is
normally 768x576, 8 colour, 8MHz 8088, although the 640x576 (640x288x2)
version can also be ordered! Also see other IO 800 products. Any volunteers
for a &lsquo;Pluto Family&rsquo; article?

80-BUS floppy disk controller board. Fully compatible with the
<a href="../../39/text/#gm809">GM809</a> that it
replaced, but with a previously unused bit of the control port being used to
switch the board between 5.25&Prime; and 8&Prime; operation, allowing both types (and
3.5&Prime; drives that electrically &lsquo;look&rsquo; like 5.25&Prime; drives) to be attached to the
GM829 at the same time. In addition the board contains a SASI interface that
is used for the connection of Winchester disk controller boards. For an
example of the flexibility of this board look at the Gemini Galaxy M-F-B
family, the top model of which has a 16&nbsp;Mbyte Winchester, double-sided 96tpi
5.25&Prime; drive, double-sided 48tpi 5.25&Prime; drive, double-sided 8&Prime; drive, and
double-sided 3.5&Prime; drive all connected via a GM829.

Mini-pallette board from IO Research, available as an add-on for the
<a href="#io828">IO828</a>
&lsquo;Pluto&rsquo; (although the latter then needs a new monitor EPROM). Gives the user
the ability to select any 8 screen colours out of a Pallette of 256. This can
be particularly impressive if 8 grey levels are selected, the resulting
picture almost looking as good as a B&amp;W photograph. Two look-up tables are
supported, and the user may switch rapidly between them.

5 slot 80-BUS backplane (with 1&Prime; pitch between boards) including 77-way 80-BUS
edge connectors. Discontinued as a built product, but the PCB continues to be
available.

80-BUS SVC (Super Video Controller) board. Fully compatible with the
<a href="../../40/text/#gm812">GM812</a>
IVC that it replaces, but with the following enhancements. 6MHz Z80B CPU
used, which in conjunction with other hardware and software changes provides
far greater speed. Second text mode is now 40x25. Graphics mode added of
256x256, with on-board monitor containing line and circle drawing routines,
polygon fill routines etc. Buzzer added. Attributes added&nbsp;&ndash; half-intensity
characters, half-tone background, blinking. All 256 characters are now user-definable
&ndash; on power up they are down-loaded from the on-board monitor, and
this includes switch options for French, Danish, German, Swedish, American and
English characters. Serial keyboard input option added&nbsp;&ndash; although this is of
Gemini&rsquo;s own design (see
<?php externalLink("GM852","",""); ?>).

Gemini&rsquo;s 80-BUS RAM-DISK board. Provides 512K bytes of RAM driven via a
&lsquo;disk-like&rsquo; 80-BUS I/O port interface of &lsquo;track&rsquo;, &lsquo;sector&rsquo; and &lsquo;data&rsquo; ports.
On-board switch allows up to 16 boards to be decoded at the same port
addresses, theoretically providing up to 8MBytes!
