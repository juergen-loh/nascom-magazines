Time flies, it seems like only yesterday I was writing
my last piece in a panic to get something into the mag. Yet,
in the intervening time I have been on holiday, come back
again, sat around, another mag. has come out, I have done
this and that and I still don&rsquo;t feel inclined to start
setting anything down for the
<a href="../../../34/01/text/#page">next issue</a>.
Still having read the
<a href="../../../32/03/text/#article1">letters</a>
in the last issue, and having a distinct feeling
that I&rsquo;m being got at, I have summoned up the energy to put
fingers to keyboard, and pour out more of the same old
gibberish I&rsquo;m famous for.
</p>
<p>
As I seem to have got away with some rude remarks about
our Editor in my last piece, well try again. He&rsquo;s had a new
toy for the last six months!! No, it&rsquo;s not Viv, as mentioned
in my
<a href="../../../31/17/text/#article1">last article</a>
... but read on. If any one in the
readership happens to be a traffic cop on the M1 or M6, en
route from Chesham to Blackburn, and if you happen to stop a
white TVR doing what it&rsquo;s supposed to (about 150, that is),
don&rsquo;t put him away for too long, or well not see another
mag until you let him out again .... That&rsquo;s if you can catch
him in the first place!!

<h3>
<u>Computer Illiteracy</u>
</h3>
<p>
Now there seems to be an interesting case of computer
illiteracy in our local junior school, and I hasten to add
that this school is one of the better thought of schools in
our area, progressive but sensible with it. Anyway the story
goes like this:
</p>
<p>
They recently spent some of the PTA loot, extorted from
mugs like me who have to spend good money going to school
fetes and things, on four computers of the type very popular
in schools right now. That&rsquo;s four computers between 400
kids, a pretty poor ratio for a start. Then they sent one
class teacher off for a one day course on teaching the kids
the mysteries of the computers. Now I believe you can learn
a lot in one day, but the mysteries of computers ... in one
day? Well when I was dragged along to the last open evening
by the Mrs (I had to go, duty or something, as she&rsquo;s on the
Board of Govenors), I decided to find out what they did with
these computers. I chatted up the teacher in charge of the
computers and tried to find out what was taught. Well it
wasn&rsquo;t programming as he didn&rsquo;t know a PEEK from a POKE, it
wasn&rsquo;t how it worked, because he didn&rsquo;t know what a
processor was, yet alone what type, or what the accumulator
was, or anything. I was told they had 32K of RAM whatever
that was, but he seemed to somewhat wooly about how much of
that was workspace, video RAM, etc. What they did have was
some &lsquo;educational&rsquo; software, but the purposes of this were
somewhat obscure, despite the teacher&rsquo;s obvious enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
In all quite a waste of twelve hundred quid if you ask
me, but I haven&rsquo;t finished yet. Number one daughter, who is
twelve, shows no inclination towards computers apart from
playing &lsquo;Wheelie&rsquo; on a Spectrum. She&rsquo;s more into carpentry
at present and spends her time murdering pieces of wood and
mangling my tools.
</p>
<p>
Number two daughter is different, ten years old and
altogether a quieter and more studious character. She wants
to learn about computers, and fully appreciates that if you
can program them, they can do very clever things far faster
than you can do them. So after seeing the computer teacher,
she went to the school library and borrowed some books.
Rather good books they are, with serious intent, but amusing
with it. Partially in comic strip, with cartoon bugs
upsetting the programs, and written in the most generalised
way. They are written for Microsoft BASIC, so what is so
syntactically different, that you can&rsquo;t get them to work?
The type of computers they use in schools of course.
</p>
<p>
Pitiful isn&rsquo;t it. Kids with interest can&rsquo;t get past the
first few hurdles because the machines they have don&rsquo;t match
the books in the library, while the teachers whilst keen,
don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s about. Number two daughter is now
allowed on my machine, and is bashing in all the programs
from David Ahl&rsquo;s book &lsquo;101 BASIC Computer Programs&rsquo;. Good
practice is this book, it&rsquo;s written for Microsoft BASIC and
because many of the programs don&rsquo;t work properly they
require modification to make them go. She&rsquo;s actually getting
very good, and is writing a database to keep track of her
bird watching activities.
</p>
<?php columnChange(22); ?>
<p>
Altogether not bad for a ten year old (Dads are allowed
a little pride in their kids, aren&rsquo;t they?), but an
indictment on the current way computers are being taught in
our local junior school. I hope this isn&rsquo;t par for the
course in other junior schools, but I rather suspect it
might be.

<h3>
<u>The printer revolution</u> (horrid pun, you work it out)
</h3>
<p>
A couple of years ago daisy wheel printers were priced
such that you could only afford one if you were the sort of
chap who could afford to buy gold plated ashtrays for the
spare Roller. Certainly not the sort of thing to be
purchased by the home user (to write poshly typed pleading
Letters to the Bank Manager), nor the sort of thing which
may be used by smaller companies to write a couple of dozen
letters a day, or to bash off the odd quote or two. In other
words they were expensive!
</p>
<p>
Despite their price what you got for your money was
something which was built like a battleship (so it didn&rsquo;t
wear out churning out thousand upon thousand of circular
letters which looked hand typed) and that went at a fair old
speed (so it didn&rsquo;t take a month of Sundays to churn out the
thousand upon .....). You know the sort I mean, the Readers&rsquo;
Digest ones which get consigned to the round filing cabinet
unread. Qume and Diablo were the byword for these printers.
As such, these beasts were (and still are) worth the money.
And if you can lay hands on one at a reasonable price, they
would still do for the better quality print job around the
home.
</p>
<p>
However, over the last year a number of &lsquo;cheaper&rsquo; daisy
wheel printers have appeared. Some of these are simply
office typewriters fitted with computer interfaces, some are
purpose built computer printers. The office typewriter types
tend towards the lightweight, both physically and also in
longevity.
</p>
<p>
Two or three years ago one famous typewriter
manfacturer got very cross with some enterprising people who
had fitted an interface to one of their lightweight
typewriters which was not designed to pound out text, sheet
after sheet at a continuous 12 characters per second without
stopping every now and then for coffee or to got to the loo
(the typist, not the typewriter; before I get any more
letters about DRH&rsquo;s funny little mistooks). The reliability
problems started to get the manufacturer a bad name. Things
have improved now, and the interfaced office typewriters are
now robust enough for the average low duty cycle of the
typical one person word processor user. Some even have the
keyboard arranged to be a serial output device so it can be
connected to the computer as the main keyboard. These also
act as stand alone office typewriters, and so are seeing
increasing use in offices around the country. As far as I&rsquo;m
concerned the only snag with these is the size. With the
built in keyboard they are too big for my situation (and I
dare say most other home users). I need something I can
stick in the corner, and as I already have a keyboard for my
computer I don&rsquo;t need (nor want to pay for) another.
</p>
<p>
When I started playing with computers the only choice
at a price I was prepared to pay, was an antiquated IBM
golfball. Solid (if its weight was anything to go by, made
of lead), reliable, horribly mechanical, noisy and slow.
These could be purchased for two or three hundred pounds and
provided hours of innocent amusement trying to interface
them to a Nascom. I wonder how many readers remember the
early issues of the
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/text/#head">INMC magazine</a>,
that was printed on the
old IBM golfball, which I might add is still giving sterling
service, although no longer in my ownership. Somewhat dearer
at that time were surplus Diablo and Qume daisy wheels,
equally as heavy and reliable, less mechanical and more
electronic, almost as noisy, a lot faster and a nightmare to
interface as a lot of them were not fitted with serial or
parallel interfaces as we know them today. Software and the
necessary hardware drivers for these were diabolical,
hampered by the total lack of cooperation on the part of the
manufacturers in supplying interface information.
</p>
<p>
Whilst thinking of interface and service information, I
remember IBM computers were totally unhelpful when it came
to details on their golfball printers. However, in this
instance, a point worth noting was that the IBM typewriter
