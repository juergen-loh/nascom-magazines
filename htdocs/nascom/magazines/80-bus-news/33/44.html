AN IMPROVED NAS-SYS? by Olav Lerflaten
</p>
<p>
Here are some suggested modifications to NAS-SYS&nbsp;3. NAS-SYS&nbsp;3, while an
excellent piece of software, has a couple of shortcomings from my point of
view. In particular:
</p>
<p>
&ndash; It does not support a parallel printer.
&ndash; Access to the ASCII characters &ldquo;{&rdquo;, mn, and &ldquo;}&rdquo; is awkward.
</p>
<p>
The latter point is perhaps of most concern to Scandinavians, as these
characters are redefined as special Scandinavian letters. To ease word
processing, the requirements are that the small &ldquo;letters&rdquo; { | } shall
correspond to the capital &ldquo;letters&rdquo; [ \ ], respectively, each pair of
&ldquo;letters&rdquo; assigned to its own key on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
Both these shortcomings are corrected by these modifications to NAS-SYS&nbsp;3. The
requirements are:
</p>
<p>
NASCOM&nbsp;2 keyboard (57 keys)
</p>
<p>
Centronics standard printer connector
</p>
<p>
PIO port A (8 lines) to printer DATA lines
PIO line BO to printer STROBE line
</p>
<p>
PIO line B2 to printer BUSY line
</p>
<p>
&ndash; PIO connector ground to printer LOGIC GROUND
</p>
<p>
|
</p>
<p>
The PIO is initialized during power-up, and reset to the printer requirements;
this must be taken into account if the PIO is to be used for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
One problem with NASCOM standard software is differences in supplying LF or
not after each CR, this gives problems when using printers. On EPSON printers
this is easily fixed, as the CR is not needed, only LF may be used to separate
lines. Consequently, this NAS-SYS version converts all CRs to LFs, and ignores
all LF codes sent from some software packages. If your printer insists on CRs,
it should be possble to convert all CRs to a CR and a LF, still ignoring
incoming LFs.
</p>
<p>
To make room for the extra facilities inside the alloted NAS-SYS space, it was
necessary to remove some existing code. I chose to attack the register display
routine, shortening it so that now it will only display the contents of the
Program Counter. After all, if you have DEBUG, you never use it anyway.

Description of new NAS-SYS facilities
</p>
<p>
a) Keyboard changes
</p>
<p>
{ and [ are on the &ldquo;[\&rdquo; key
</p>
<p>
| and \ are on the &lsquo;CH/LF&rsquo; key
</p>
<p>
} and ] are on the &ldquo;] " key
</p>
<p>
@ is now unshifted, repeating
</p>
<p>
__ is Shift/@
Remarks: The @ key is no longer available as an extra CTRL key (this facility
is only needed on NASCOM-1 keyboards). CH and LF are not very important
control codes, consequently they do not need their own key. CH is still
