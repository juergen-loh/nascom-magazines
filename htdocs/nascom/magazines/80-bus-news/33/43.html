MultiNet interface board. This small board is connected to the system via a
<?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "Z80A PIO", ""); ?>. An on-board DIL switch provides a unique station address to allow
up to 32 systems to be connected together. The board transmits data onto the
Network at 250&nbsp;kbaud, at distances up to 600 metres using RS422 differential
transmission.

80-BUS Colour board. Previously produced by Climax Computers, production of
this board has now been taken over by Gemini. The board uses the Thomson
EF9365 controller chip and provides high speed vector graphics of 256 x 256 in
16 colours. The chip also has a built-in character generator, and can write
text in various orientations. Output is PAL UHF and analogue RGB TTL.

80-BUS prototyping board. One of the great attractions of 80-BUS is the ease
with which one-off boards can be interfaced to it, and this board provides an
ideal base for one of these, incorporating extensive power rail connections,
and laid out to allow high density IC packing.

14 slot 80-BUS backplane from Microcode. NOT supplied with any 80-BUS 77-way
edge connectors. All active BUS signals are terminated into a potential
balanced RC filter and are interlaced with ground shield tracks. The board
can be easily &lsquo;cut-down&rsquo; if required for smaller systems.

This 80-BUS extender board allows 80-BUS boards to be brought outside of a
frame for testing and debugging purposes. Test point pins are provided on all
lines, and all lines have their 80-BUS nomenclature.

Well, that&rsquo;s enough for this time.

I hope to continue through
to GM888, and possibly beyond&nbsp;!! I hope that the above descriptions bring out
a few points that you were possibly unaware of before, and thus help you to
find your way through the growing maze of products. 80-BUS provides a very
flexible means of producing so many possible self-tailored systems, and if the
information above in some way helps just one reader from making a potentially
costly incorrect decision then it has been justified.
