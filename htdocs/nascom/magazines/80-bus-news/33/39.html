<p>
80-BUS CPU board. 4MHz Z80A processor, Z80A PIO, 8250 UART providing
programmable baud rates, stop bits, parity, etc., RS232 interface, 1200&nbsp;baud
CUTS cassette interface, 8-bit input port. Most powerful feature of this
board is the four &lsquo;byte-wide&rsquo; 28 pin sockets that may be populated with
EPROMs, ROMs or static RAMs from 2Kx8 to 16Kx8 (32Kx8?) per socket, thus
making the board suitable for many control applications with, for example, 48K
of EPROM and 8K of RAM on board. On-board memory may be switched out of
memory map under software control. Memory decoding is provided by PROM which
must be replaced if the standard 4 by 4Kx8 decoding is unsuitable. Normally
supplied with RP/M monitor that emulates CP/M in a cassette based environment,
and can also &lsquo;boot&rsquo;
