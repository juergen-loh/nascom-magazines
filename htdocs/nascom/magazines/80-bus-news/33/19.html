after which it is reset for the next line. If it is still working through one
of the 25 &lsquo;character&rsquo; lines on the screen then it is reset to N and the
character generator &lsquo;line&rsquo; address is incremented by one, otherwise it is
reset to N+80 to select the next line of characters. When the display line
starts the controller turns ON the &lsquo;display enable&rsquo; signal. This is turned OFF
after address N+79 is passed. Then, as further pre-programmed character
positions are passed, the controller generates the Horizontal Sync pulse, and
finally the internal reset signal for the counter.
</p>
<p>
From the information we have given it the controller thinks it is
displaying characters N to N+79, but by playing around with the external
delays we actual display N+1 to N+80, and in the process gain sufficient
advance warning of an active display line to prevent any unseemly clash
between the Z80 and the display controller. As the controller has been fooled
over the start of the display, it also has to be mis-informed about the cursor
position, a task that the NMI routine carries out as it updates the internal
registers of the controller.

<h3>
INTERRUPTS
</h3>
<p>
With the display contention problem solved by hardware, various other
changes could be made. One was the use of the interrupt system. Previously,
with the transparent screen access being determined by software loops,
interrupts could not be used as they could interfere with critical parts of
the loop. With the
<?php externalLink("SVC","",""); ?>,
keyboard input is now done under interrupt. Also,
while the SVC-MON is scrolling the screen (with an LDIR instruction), it
enables an interrupt routine to collect and buffer incoming characters from
the Host. Normally the SVC-MON polls for input characters.
</p>
<h3>
KEYBOARDS
</h3>
<p>
An option for a serial keyboard has been included in the SVC. This is an
either/or option with the parallel keyboard, not an AND one, as they both
share the same IO port (on the SVC) and some of the interface circuitry. The
serial keyboard requires fewer wires to interface it, and this leads to lower
cost. (See the latest Gemini price list &ndash; The multi-core &lsquo;curly-wurly&rsquo; cables
for the parallel keyboard cost a fair bit! The difference in price solely
reflects the cabling costs. There is no difference in keyboard costs as the
change required on it was only a small one in the on-board software. (The
keyboards use an 8035 single-chip microprocessor to scan the key matrix and
generate the appropriate ASCII codes.)
</p>
<h3>
NMI
</h3>
<p>
As with the
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>,
on the SVC the vertical sync output of the display
controller is connected to the NMI input of the on-board Z80. However the SVC
NMI service routine performs different functions. It no longer scans the
keyboard as that has been transfered to a conventional interrupt routine (see
above). It handles the timing of various attributes. The tone generator for
the on-board bleeper is directly enabled and disabled by the SVC monitor and
thus the duration (but not the frequency) of the &lsquo;bleep&rsquo; is fixed at an
integral number of NMIs. Similarly the low frequency waveform used to &lsquo;blink&rsquo;
characters is also generated by this software. One other feature,
<a href="../../../32/31/text/#article1">mentioned by Dave Hunt</a>
in the last issue, is the implementation of a software &lsquo;clock&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
One point to bear in mind when you start thinking &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be nice If..&rsquo;
is the fact that the NMI routine is executed once every 20mS. The larger and
more cumbersome it becomes, the more it is likely to have an impact on the
