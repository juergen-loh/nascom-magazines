d) NAS-DIS
Use in Direct mode (NAS-SYS U command).
As NAS-DIS asks for memory addresses, unpredictable things may happen to the
printer. This is because the subroutine outputs an ESC code, which the printer
takes as the start of a control code. The cure:
&ndash; Either turn the printer momentarily off when NAS-DIS signals &ldquo;Go?&rdquo;
&ndash; Or change these memory locations in NAS-DIS:
cboo0 00 NOP
cDol 00 NOP
CD02 00 NOP
</p>
<p>
e) ZEAP
Change printer reflection:
OF 04 DF 4C C9 SCAL &ldquo;L RET
ZEAP U command will now list the source file, and ZEAP A command will, with
option 04, give assembly listing.
</p>
<p>
f) BASIC
Use in direct mode (NAS-SYS U command). It is possible to turn printing on and
off from BASIC with DOKE statements:
</p>
<p>
Printer on &ndash; DOKE 3187,1912
</p>
<p>
Printer off &ndash; DOKE 3187,1913
