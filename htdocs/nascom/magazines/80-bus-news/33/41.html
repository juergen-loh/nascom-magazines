A serial daughter board for the
<a href="../../40/text/#gm816">GM816</a>
(see above) providing two 8250 UARTs
with RS232 interfaces. These UARTs have programmable baud rates, stop bits,
parity, stop bits etc, and also spare user-programmable input and output bits.

80-BUS Speech board, using the National Semiconductor Digitalker chip set.
This card has a limited on-board vocabulary contained in ROM, and making it
say anything outside of this limited library is extremely difficult. Produced
by Arfon Microelectronics, who unfortunately went into receivership. Boards
MAY still be available from one or two dealers.
