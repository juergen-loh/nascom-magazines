ALLDISC VARIABLE DISC FORMAT UTILITY
</p>
<p>
ALLDISC is a new approach to the problem of lots of
different machines all with different disk formats.
Designed for use with the Gemini and Nascom CP/M
computers, ALLDISC replaces the existing disk drivers
and the CP/M disk parameter headers from an archive of
different formats. Up to 6 drives and two controller
cards are supported, the drives may be a mixture of 8",
5.25 or 3.5" types in either single or double density
and may be single or double sided. 96 tpi 5.25" drives
can be made to &lsquo;double step&rsquo; to read and write 48 tpi
disks. The Gemini GM833 512K virtual disk RAM is also
supported. All this adds up to a very powerful system
where the drives fitted to the system may be
reconfigured to read and write disks of different
formats. The limitations are that the disks must be to
1BM3740 CRC standards and must be soft sectored (or in
other words, it will cope with most disks).
</p>
<p>
The archive is supplied with nine useful formats
when supplied, with others being made available to
resistered users free of charge for the first six months
from registration. The archive can be edited and new
formats created. Disks can be formatted from the
archive so there is no need for preformatted disks when
transferring software.
</p>
<p>
ALLDISC is supplied with full documentation and
hints and pointers to discovering unknown disk formats.
ALLDISC costs 172.50 inc. VAT. (150.00 + VAT).

MOIS THE INTELLIGENT DISASSEMBLER
</p>
<p>
MDIS is a CP/M disassembler useable on most
standard CP/M machines, switchable for either 8080
or Z80 mnemonics. Command syntax is designed to be
similar to the Microsoft M80 assembler, and
redirected input from&nbsp;.DAT files is allowed. The output
files to printer or disk may include the disassembled
code or in M80 format and output label types are
differentiated by different letter prefixes. A powerful
package at a price which is a lot Jess than its
competitors. Supplied in most popular 5.25" disk formats
(state type when ordering) at 57.50 inc. VAT.

ccPz
</p>
<p>
Replaces the CCP in CP/M and provides
hierarchical file searches through user areas
(invaluable when using more than one user area on high
Capacity drives). New commands for getting and
executing files, and lots more. Now available rewritten
as an M80 .MAC file using Z80 mnemonics as well as the
earlier&nbsp;.ASM file, with two recently discovered bugs
</p>
<p>
fixed. Supplied in most popular 5.25" formats (please
state when ordering) at 11.50 inc. VAT.

BDOSZ
</p>
<p>
Yes, you guessed jit. Some enterprising person
has now &lsquo;disconbooberated&rsquo; the BDOS in CP/M and
rewritten it as a Z80 program. Its fully compatible with
the original with no bugs found to date. Because it&rsquo;s
written in Z80 code it&rsquo;s smaller, this has allowed
room for tidying up all the annoying stupids in the
original BDOS so that errors like:
</p>
<p>
BOOS ERROR ON x: R/O
</p>
<p>
which usually causes you to lose everything you&rsquo;ve
just done, becomes the far more helpful:
</p>
<p>
Disk x: is set R/O
</p>
<p>
Do it anywayu (Y/N/7C)
</p>
<p>
Which, of course, means you don&rsquo;t lose anything. It even
allows you to change disks when they are full without
loss of data. In all, a lovely piece of software.
Available in most popular 5.25" formats (please state
when ordering) at 11.50 inc. VAT.

NEW SUPER DISKPEN (PENVG:3)
</p>
<p>
DISKPEN has been rewritten and revised. This
popular text editor/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>formatter now includes a &lsquo;HELP
facility, and new features for the print control of the
most popular printers, underline, bold, etc {also
user patchable for the less popular types). New
features include block delete, better move commands,
new cursor control, optional hyphenation, visible
indentation setting and lots more. A major enhancement
is the ability to handle overlay files so that PEN can
use auxilliary packages such as the MAXiFILE free
field file searching utility or the print spooling
utility.
</p>
<p>
The new DISKPEN is useable on all Gemini
multiboard computers (Galaxy, Kenilworth, Quantum)
and Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini hybrids, (MAPPEN is available for
users of the MAP video card). DISKPEN is available as an
upgrade to earlier DISKPENs and GEMPENS at 17.25
inc. VAT., or to new purchasers at 57.50 inc. VAT.
(Please state disk format when ordering.)

WE DON&rsquo;T SELL 96 t.p.i. DISKS!!!
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s true, we only selu 5.25" 48 t.p.i. disks, and
the reason is simple. Read the article about the disks a
few issues back. We&rsquo;ve found that the reliabilty of 48
t.p.i. disks is identical to that of 96 t.p.i disks, and
they are cheaper!!!
In tens, we sell them at:
Maxell 3&rdquo; CF-2 flippy disks

3M 5.25" double sided double density
