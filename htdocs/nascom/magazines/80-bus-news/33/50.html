GEC LTU-11 PRESTEL MODEM KIT
</p>
<p>
The GEC LTU-11 PRESTEL modem kit consists of two
components, the modem card and the direct telephone
coupler. The modem card accepts I/O at TTL levels at 75
BAUD and returns data at TTL levels at 1200 BAUD. The
modem card produces the necessary modem tones which are
fed to the direct coupler. The coupler consists of the
line isolation transformer which sends and receives the
modem tones and has TTL level inputs for the control
relays for line seize and auto-dial. Power- supplies are
+5 volts and &ndash;5 volts. The units individually have BT
approval, but as the unit is supplied as a kit, the BT
approval is void. Supplied complete with connection data
and auto-dial software.
