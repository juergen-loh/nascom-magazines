Now I haven&rsquo;t seen this one either and the code
consists of a simple patch in the front of PIP. Once
changed, this version of PIP can&rsquo;t be used for anything
else, so Arto&rsquo;s suggestion is that the patched PIP be called
IOPIP. The code came as a hard copy dump and wasn&rsquo;t quite
complete. Fortunately Arto also sent a disk with IOPIP.COM
on it, so I disassembled it and then re-assembled it. I then
checked the newly assembled code was the same as the code on
disk, just in case. Now if you look at the patch area in PIP
as supplied, you&rsquo;ll see that there is the start jump, two
fake RETs and a great wodge of bytes which read
(INP:/OUT:SPACE). This routine neatly fits in this space
with acres to spare, which now I know the space is there, I
can think of a number of things which could be shoved in.
Anyway, Arto&rsquo;s source code is shown later.

All very simple and straight forward, this program
should work with a direct wired connection or through a
modem via the telephone, but there have to be snags. One
problem is that you can not assume an 8-bit data transfer,
some machines only have 7-bit serial I/O implemented, so
transfering object code files is a problem. Apart from that
Arto&rsquo;s letter implies that the [0] option with PIP doesn&rsquo;t
work as the receiver can not see a ^Z under this option and
therefore doesn&rsquo;t know when the file is finished (I know
this to be true, and the [B] option doesn&rsquo;t work either).
Hitting RESET does not close the file, so some or all the
file will be lost. His suggestion is to transmit all files
in HEX in the Intel HEX format and use the LOAD.COM program
provided with CP/M to convert back it into a .COM file. This
is alright if you have the CP/M User Group utility
UNLOAD.COM which converts a file into Intel HEX format. If
you haven&rsquo;t tough!! Well perhaps not tough, just tough work,
you see, I&rsquo;ve just used UNLOAD to unload itself, so if you
are really masochistic, you can sit down and type the
following in using a word processor and then use LOAD to
turn it into a .COM file. If you use Wordstar, do this in
the non-document mode, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have soft carriage
returns, and that will probably upset LOAD.

Well that just about sums it all up for this time. I&rsquo;ll
keep Arto&rsquo;s article on switching between NASDOS and Nascom
CP/M over until next time, so until next time have fun
getting UNLOAD typed in.
