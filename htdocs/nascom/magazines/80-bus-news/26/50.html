The Spectre of Impending Doom
</h3>
<p>
There are a lot of cowboys in the home computer business (if you hadn&rsquo;t
already noticed) and these are about to get their &lsquo;come uppance&rsquo;. Gazing into
my crystal ball the other day, I noticed that over the months there has been a
distinct downturn in the sales of the &lsquo;Mickey Mouse&rsquo; computers (you don&rsquo;t
expect me to name them do you?). Now a lot of this is due to the faddish
buying profiles of the Great British public.
</p>
<p>
A few years back metal detectors were the thing, and a little later, a
vast boom in dedicated TV games. Where are they now? I no longer know where to
get a metal detector even if I wanted one, although in 1977 I could have had a
choice of several in the local branch of one of the chain chemists. Last
Christmas every kid, but every kid, expected a home computer in their
Christmas stockings, and dad justified the expense by saying that he might as
well get some use out of it and catch up on the &lsquo;New Technology&rsquo; at the same
time. How many of these computers are now kept at the back of a dark cupboard
and are no longer in use because the users got bored with the games you could
get, or &lsquo;Could never quite get the knack of this programming lark&rsquo;.

<p>
No, it&rsquo;s my guess that this Christmas will ring the death knell fora
number of familiar names; the Christmas spurt through newsagents, chemists,
etc, will be the death throws of the home computer market. So where are the
cowboys going to catch a cold? Well reliable information has it that there are
thousands of Hong Kong and Taiwanese computers on the seas at this very
moment, and the cowboys and GRQM&rsquo;s (Get Rich Quick Merchants, a mnemonic,
courtesy of John Marshall) who have ordered them are going to be left with
lots of machines and no market to sell them in. This means that those machines
are going to be dumped at silly prices with no follow up support. This is bad
news for those SERIOUSLY involved in the home computer business, as the word
is going to spread that home computers are not worth touching as the: &lsquo;So
called dealers can&rsquo;t support the machines, can&rsquo;t supply software, and are
generally useless&rsquo;. Whilst this may be true of many, the good machines and the
good dealers (the minority in both instances) will get rolled in with the bad
and that will do no one any good.

<p>
Which leads to an interesting development. Several of the manufacturers
catering to the home computer market have been looking into the future and
have seen the gloom approaching. So they think they will have a go at the
economy end of the business machine market just to keep in business. Dragon
have just introduced the Dragon 64 with a disk operating system called OS9,
something I&rsquo;m told is UNIX like. How far they expect to get with that with
only three pieces of application software and a 57 x 24 screen I do not know.
Lynx, because their machine is Z80 based have opted for CP/M. I&rsquo;ve seen a
sample with the most atrocious screen handling that can be imagined. Both
manufacturers hope to sell systems at under a &pound;1000. Best of luck in view of
what follows.

The clouds are gathering over the business computer market. The big shake
out is coming. Big names are going broke weekly and those who hoped to climb
onto the bandwagon are having serious second thoughts. The &lsquo;el cheapo&rsquo;
business machines are in trouble, they seem to have saturated their own
market, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to make much difference how much free software you
give away with the machine. IBM are now wagging the &lsquo;business machine&rsquo; dog
very firmly by the tail, so if you hope to sell a new business machine, it had
better look like an IBM&nbsp;PC. All this despite the fact that large numbers of
