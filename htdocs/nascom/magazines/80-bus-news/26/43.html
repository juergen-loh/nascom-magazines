EPROM PROGRAMMERS
</p>
<p>
This issue I start with a few comments about the Bits &amp; PCs EPROM
programmer that appeared as the Gemini G808. I bought one shortly after they
first appeared, and have used it quite a bit since then. Some time ago I
started to have trouble programming some of my 2716s, (I never used it for
2708s), and even after overprogramming them several times some bytes were
still not programmed. I put this down to old-age on the part of the EPROMs,
after all they had been through the program/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>erase cycle many times, and so I
marked them as suspect and put them on one side. Some months later I happened
to check the programming voltage on an EPROM as it was being programmed, and
found it was only 21v rather than the required 25v. Off load the programmer
produced the correct 25v. This made me dig out the 2716 data sheet, and a
quick glance showed that a maximum current of 25ma could be drawn from the 25v
supply during programming. I removed the 2716 from the programmer, and
replaced it by a 1k resistor from pin 21 to ground. (25v across 1k gives a
current of 25mA). I then started &ldquo;programming&rdquo; and measured the programming
voltage that appeared across the 1k resistor &ndash; 18v. Bingo, there was my
answer, the charge pump that generates the 25v supply for G808 was obviously
rather short of breath, and unable to provide the necessary power. The 2716s I
had had trouble with were obviously not programming because the programming
voltage was too low. Perhaps with use the programming current actually taken
by a 2716 slowly increases, and these had reached the stage where the on-board
25v supply was seriously overloaded.
</p>
<p>
The 25v is generated by a charge-pump circuit based round a 555 timer
running as an oscillator. This runs off the +12v and &ndash;5v supplies, and
theoretically adds another 17v onto the 12v line (ignoring all losses!), which
is then regulated to 25v. I scrabbled in the proverbial junk box and tried
changing the 555 to no effect. Altering the values of various components
around the 555 didn&rsquo;t help either. So I went to the drawer containing
&ldquo;projects started but never finished&rdquo; and dug out the last of my EPROM
programmer designs that had failed to see the light of day (until now). This
particular one used a Texas Instruments TL497 switching regulator in a step-up
mode to generate 25v from a 5v supply. This I connected in parallel with the
existing voltage generator on G808, and there-after I had my 25v. The 2716s
previously labelled &ldquo;defunct&rdquo; now programmed perfectly. As this fix worked I
progressed no further.
</p>
<p>
My solution (of geting the 25V from elsewhere), is one way out, but if
anyone with the same problem can come up with a suitable simple modification
to the G808 circuit &ndash; send it in. Either as a few words which I can include in
a an column, or as a short article in its own right (in which case you get
paid!).

<p>
Generous offer THAT NO-ONE SHOULD REFUSE
</p>
<p>
Talking of articles for the NEWS, if an article is submitted on a Gemini-format
CP/M disk then the odds of it being published shorten considerably. So,
in order to help the balance of articles in favour of non-disk (or non-CP/M)
systems, I am offering to accept articles on cassette tape (Nascom&nbsp;2 or Gemini
format &ndash; not Nascom&nbsp;1 tapes I&rsquo;m afraid) or disk (5.25" or 8" &ndash; any format).
These I will transcribe and pass on to the Editor. Note: this offer applies
only to machine readable media &ndash; I&rsquo;m not offering to type anything in from
paper! All I ask is that you include two things:
