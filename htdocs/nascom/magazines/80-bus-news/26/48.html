<h3>
Final tweak
</h3>
<p>
For those who wish to persevere we are effectively going to invert the
high order bit of the row address counter (IC53/11). This way we can use the
asynchronous clear input as a &lsquo;set-to-eight&rsquo; input rather than a &lsquo;set-to-zero&rsquo;.
Lift IC56/5 IC56/6 IC68/5 IC53/11. Connect IC53/11 to IC68/5. The row
address counter now directly drives the line counter IC68 instead of being
routed via the inverter IC56c. Connect IC53/11 to IC56/5, and IC56/6 to IC54/5
(or IC44/11 or IC66/5). This means that we have the inverse of the msb of IC53
driving RS3. Finally connect IC53/1, (after disconnecting it from +5V if you
added that earlier), to the load line from the PROM. (IC59/1 or IC68/11 or
IC13/13 or IC57/10). This connects the load signal to the clear of IC53. As
the RS3 line is now inverted in IC56c, clearing IC53 is equivalent to setting
RS0-RS3 to 8, thus removing a further 8 TV lines from the frame.

Try little steps
</h3>
<p>
If you totally loose the top line(s) of your display, trying taking
things a step at a time until you reach a point where you can lock your
TV/Monitor. First try presetting IC68 to 11, then 12, then&hellip;

That&rsquo;s almost all for this issue, but just one final comment to confuse
those of you who have read
<a href="../../29/text/#article1">Richard Beal&rsquo;s article</a>.
I have a Shugart SA800 8&Prime; drive connected to my
<?php externalLink("GM829","",""); ?>,
and currently it spends most of its time powered
down. In this state it does not interfere in any way with my use of the 5.25&Prime;
drives, so you may be lucky like me, or unlucky like RB, in which case I
suggest you switch off and unplug before doing any rewiring!

<u>Addendum to the Belectra HSA-88B Review</u>
</h2>
<p>
The
<a href="../../../25/07/text/#article1">above review</a>
just made it into the last issue by the narrowist of
margins, and thus one correction and some updated information couldn&rsquo;t be
included. First a minor point, the board size is 8&Prime;x4&Prime;, not 8&Prime;x3&Prime; as stated.
Secondly, as the review board and documentation reached me at different times
and from different sources one document was left out. This was a seven-page
addendum to the <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal manual, detailing the differences between
versions 4 and 5. (Anyone who has bought the card will have received a copy).
</p>
<p>
As well as various enhancements to the compiler it points out that all
integers in HP5 are 32-bit integers, giving a MAXINT of 2147483647! For the
REAL precision and format it refers you to the
<?php externalLink("AM9511","AMD9511"); ?> documentation (see the
review). The information on where to patch the run-time routines in order to
use the
<?php externalLink("HSA-88B"); ?>
at an alternative address is also given.
