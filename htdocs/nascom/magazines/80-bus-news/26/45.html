ouput coupling capacitor). If you do short out C7, and your monitor does
provide a 75 ohm termination, then you may also improve matters by raising the
value of the emitter resistor (R6) to 1k or more.

<p>
(N.B. Nascom&nbsp;2 owners who use a monitor rather than a TV and the on-board
modulator may like to make similar modifications. I assume the current drive
levels on the N2 are set up for the modulator, rather than the direct video
output).

<p>
Moving on to &lsquo;The sands of time&rsquo;, this interference is obviously being
caused by crosstalk from the logic on the IVC. (The patterns change depending
on what job the Host is asking the IVC to perform). I started by decoupling
the collector of TR1, the top end of the Base bias chain (R3), and adding
diodes in series with R1 and R5 (the &lsquo;bar&rsquo; towards the output of each gate).
The thinking behind the latter is that it isolates the &lsquo;Hi&rsquo; output level from
the video drive, each gate now looking like an open collector driver. As a
result R5 was changed to 470 ohms, and R1 to 220 ohms to get back to the
correct video and sync levels. This didn&rsquo;t produce any significant change to
the visible interference.
</p>
<p>
So finally I resorted to butchery. I cut the thick power track running to
the collector of TR1, and the corresponding track running to the top end of
R3. I connected these two isolated points together, and decoupled them with a
47uF tantalum capacitor. I finally added a 68 ohm resistor between this point
and the positive supply. (A few turns of wire on a ferrite toroid would have
been better, but I had no toroid to hand). This certainly reduced the
background noise, although a little was still visible if you looked for it. At
this point I stopped. The next step to try, (if you are seeking perfection),
is to build a new output stage on a separate board, taking care over the
layout and postioning of the board. As for me &ndash; I&rsquo;m sticking with what I&rsquo;ve
got!

Mixed 5.25&Prime; and 8&Prime; drives on GM829

In the case of the 5.25&Prime; drives the
lack of a ready line, though inconvenient
from a software point of view, is not a
total disaster. This is because the motor-on
monostable will eventually time out and
produce a &lsquo;not ready&rsquo; signal. This
immediately causes any &lsquo;hung-up&rsquo; access to a
5.25&Prime; drive to abort. However, when 8&Prime;
drives are selected, all the circuitry
associated with the motor-on monostable is
disabled because virtually all 8&Prime; drives use
mains powered motors which run continually.
As a result there is no abort signal unless
the 8&Prime; ready line is connected through. The
Fig&nbsp;3. answer is to insert link 3 &ndash; to connect the
ready signal through &ndash; and to &lsquo;fake&rsquo; ready
signals from those drives that do not
provide them directly.
