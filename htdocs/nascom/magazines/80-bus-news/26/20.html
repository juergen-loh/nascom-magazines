Late extra bits!

Prompted by my unusually rude remarks, several people have stopped being
apathetic, and volunteered to set up and organise software circulation systems
for systems like theirs. Incidentally, would whoever is hanging onto the
original Circle disc please put it back into circulation. It is an Inmac
lifetime one, and the owner must be wishing he had used a cheap one!

Nascom users running Nas-Dos with Nascom double density drives should

Users compatible with G805 using DCS-DOS and/or CP/M (but I don&rsquo;t know
what drives &ndash; Pertec, I assume?) should write to Ray Cutler, _ ________ ____,
Cradley Heath, Warley, West Midlands, B64 6DX. He says if you have a text
editor to spare, it would help, as he is writing letters in the form of BASIC
programs at present! No piracy, please...

I have been sent (by our generous editor) a huge pile of Nascom related
items, which I hope to be able to get to work on soon. If you have been
wondering what happened to your masterpiece for ages, I think I have it. Don&rsquo;t
worry, if it gets printed, you get paid, not me!

Belectra Arithmetic Board
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
We wish to clarify the following points regarding the review of our
Arithmetic processor board in Vol. 2 Issue 5 of 80-BUS News:
</p>
<p>
1) The Programming Manual is now printed on a printer with desenders.
</p>
<p>
2) Because Mr Parkinson received our review board directly from Gemini
Microcomputers, who borrowed it for an exhibition, while some parts of the
documentation came directly from us, he did not receive the complete
documentation set. The HP5 Pascal compiler is a substantially enhanced
version of HP4 and the Manual sent out with each board clearly lists all the
differences and enhancements.
</p>
<p>
3) We have not tested our board with the Am9512 processor but we can see no
reason why it should not work. Anyone requiring this alternative processor is
welcome to contact us.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully
P.Holy, Director, Belectra Ltd.
