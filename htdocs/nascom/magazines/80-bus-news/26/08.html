better, so if the disks are being used for business and the firm is paying,
then use them, otherwise, anything that goes will do. Personally, I keep my
eyes open for secondhand disks, they&rsquo;re usually the best bet and dirt cheap
(if not actually given away).

Stubborn Disks
</p>
<p>
Now on to another couple of tips. If you&rsquo;ve got a disk that resolutely
refuses to format in one or two places, don&rsquo;t necessarily assume that it is
seratched and therefore useless. Before you ditch it (or take it back from
whence it came), try an old &lsquo;speaker magnet on it. Needless to say, keep the
magnet away from your other disks, but by giving the disk a good stir up with
a powerful magnet, even the crudiest disks seem to spring into life. Don&rsquo;t ask
me why, but they do!!!
</p>
<p>
Another point is formatting disks. Always allow time for the disk
temperature to stabilize within the drive. It&rsquo;s no good formatting a stone
cold disk and then expecting it to work on a hot day when the machine has been
on for a couple of hours, as the originally formatted tracks are likely to be
in entirely different positions under warms conditions. Shove the disk in the
hole and wait for 30 &ndash; 40 seconds to allow the disk to warm up before
formatting.

The final answer with Verbatim disks was revealed to me in a letter from
Rory O&rsquo;Farrell. A little while ago I gave him a disk on which he found no less
than 65 duff sectors, Rory concludes as follows, &ldquo;It might be due to some
unkind person having put fingerprints all over the back of it, but as it was a
Verbatim disk, made in Ireland, it is more probably due to their cutting down
the Fairy Thorn tree that once stood on their site at Raheen, Co. Limerick. As
I&rsquo;m sure you realise, immeasurable bad luck always accompanies interference
with the fairies.&rdquo; So if all else fails, go to the bottom of your garden and
talk to the fairies.

Drive care (or lack of)
</p>
<p>
T hear a lot of waffle about cleaning disk drive heads. Again, if the
propaganda is to be believed, disk drive heads should be cleaned weekly with
the brand X disk cleaning kit for only &pound;25.00. Now I can&rsquo;t answer for the
public as a whole, but I&rsquo;ve found that our customers fall over backwards with
mirth at the thought that I was daft enough to buy some of these kits for
stock in the hope that some customer would be equally as daft as to pay the
asking price. In fact, the couple of disk cleaning kits the glib, smooth
tongued rep. managed to flog me remain untouched, not even I can afford to use
then.
</p>
<p>
Now I have had access to disk based machines for about 3 years now, and
during that time I have dismantled and examined a number of drives for various
reasons. (Don&rsquo;t you try it or you&rsquo;ll be along for the rip-off &pound;25.00 disk
drive alignment disk the same rep. talked me into. Realigning drive heads is
something for masochists and loonies only, I know I qualify.) Anyway, to the
point, I have not yet seen a drive head that warranted cleaning. Not even the
drives out of the Galaxy we had in recently which seemed to live in the bottom
of a cement works. This instance doesn&rsquo;t say much for the fan filters, as the
whole thing was potted under a quarter inch layer of cement dust, but at least
the heads were pristine clean.
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m saying that drive heads never need cleaning, all I&rsquo;m
saying is that I have yet to see one that DOES need cleaning. So don&rsquo;t get
talked into expensive disk head cleaning kits when any faults are more likely
down to something else.
