and swell. The mechanical temperature compensation of the drives was coping
quite well with the high temperatures as proved by the fact that disks could
be formatted and used normally; what it couldn&rsquo;t cope with was disks, which
having drunk most of the atmospheric moisture around them and swollen up,
became a few thousandsth of an inch larger in diameter than usual. Of course
the greatest affect of this swelling would be at the outer edges of the disk,
and guess where the boot and system tracks are.
</p>
<p>
So what was the cure. Well we did nothing, we managed to copy the old
disks to new disks prepared under the elevated temperature and humidity and
used those for the duration. We didn&rsquo;t chuck the old disks, because as soon as
the weather returned to normal (sub-zero and rain), we updated the old disks
from the new, and went back to using the old disks with no further trouble.
However, one fact did emerge from that episode, and that was that Dysan disks
were not affected anything like as badly as the others. I have since learned
that Dysan lacquer their disks to stop them absorbing moisture and to improve
their wearing capabilities, the only trouble with Dysan is that they are twice
the price of the competition.

<h3>
Different disk prices
</h3>
<p>
Now on to the differences in price of double and single sided disks, and
quad, double and single density disks. It is my opinion that all disks (except
those coated on one side only for single sided use) are created equal, that is
double sided, double density, 80 track (96 t.p.i.) disks. In the process of
manufacture, they are tested and those which pass the 80 track test become
quad disks, those which fail the 80 track test are rechecked at 40 track (48
t.p.i), those which pass becoming double density disks, and then the failures
are checked as single density disks. Those that fail then end up in the bin.
By this time most, if not all, of the disks have been accepted. Now the
vagaries of disk production are not likely to bow to the dictates of the
marketing boys whose market profile shows that the majority of disks required
are the 40 track double sided breed. In fact, if the production process is
going well and not too many lumps are in the pudding before coating, then the
majority of disks that fall off the end of the production line are going to be
of the double sided 80 track breed and not what is required for sale. So I
guess a fair proportion of 80 track disks are diverted and labelled as 40
track disks, simply because the disks being made are better than
specification.
</p>
<p>
So what is this all leading up to? Well we&rsquo;ve stopped selling 80 track
verified disks for a start. We sell (and use ourselves) only 40 track disks
for the 80 track machines. This saves about 70p per disk with no apparent
difference of performance whatever. We still get about 1% of duff disks, be
they 80 track or 40 track, so as duff disks are sent back for exchange I know
we would rather have the 70p&rsquo;s and so would you. All this is borne out by the
fact that the original box of &lsquo;single sided single density&rsquo; disks I bought for
testing the original Henelec disk controller at the time when it was fitted
with single sided Shugart SA400&rsquo;s are still seeing useful daily life on my
present machine as &lsquo;quad density double sided&rsquo;; and not one of them shows any
signs of either wearing out or giving verify errors.

<h3>
My Advice
</h3>
<p>
So my advice? Find out what brands of disk suit your machine, and when
you&rsquo;ve found that out, find out how cheap you can get them. Never buy 80 track
verified disks just because you&rsquo;ve got an 80 track machine, it seems a waste
of money to me. The only exception I make is Dysan, they certainly behave
better in high humidity environments and because of the lacquer, should wear
