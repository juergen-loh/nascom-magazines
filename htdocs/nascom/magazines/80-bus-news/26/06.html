<h3>
<u>Testing Disk Suitability</u>
</h3>
<p>
One way to test the suitablity of a disk is to do a bit of software
twiddling, not so easy as you have to understand the disk drive primitives,
but consists of counting disk read failures. Not may people will be prepared
to try this as an idea, and it does require a lot of disks to produce a valid
statistical sample, so the only way is to gain experience over a period of
time. I&rsquo;ve noted, long term, that certain make of drive X will always be less
reliable with disk brand Y than with disk brand Z.

<h3>
<u>Temperature and Humidity</u>
</h3>
<p>
Finding media errors this way may suggest that it is the magnetic coating
which is unsuitable, again not necessarily true, as this assumes that all
other things are equal. We have discounted temperature and humidity.
Temperature first. If we take the worst case, double sided 96 track per inch
drives, the track width is about 7 thou. Now at the outer edge of the disk
this means that the head mechanism has to move the head to a known position
+/&nbsp; about 2 thou, not a difficult engineering job provided expansion is
ignored. Taking expansion into account lifts drive and disk design from the
mundane to the extremely difficult. The base material of the disk is usually
mylar, a plastic of well defined characteristics, but one which non-the-less
expands with temperature. Likewise, the drive head cantilever (or whatever
type of support mechanism is used) also expands with temperature, and being
made of different materials, like as not at a different rate. Shugart, in some
of their earlier drives took the logical step of making the head support
mechanism of the same material as the disk, unfortunately, one of the
properties of mylar is flexibility so what they gained by matching the
coefficient of expansion, they lost by the head wobbling all over the place.
These days nylon head supports are usual, and the shape and length of the
support, coupled with the length and material of the lead screw or cam used to
move the head are combined to ensure that the head moves with expansion at a
uniform and equal rate to the expansion of the disk, <span class="uppercase">Over a limited
temperature range</span>. So knowing this temperature range is important, it&rsquo;s
certainly between 15 and 35 C, and most drives are better. If the computer is
cased and ventilation is inadequate, it&rsquo;s surprising how high the temperature
can rise within the box. This wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time I&rsquo;ve heard of
obstinate media/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>drive faults causing disk misreads being entirely cured by
cleaning out six months accumulated muck from the fan filter!!! Another
&lsquo;aside&rsquo; on the subject of temperature, why are diskettes always black? I&rsquo;ll
let you work that one out yourselves.

<p>
Humidity. Now that&rsquo;s one I didn&rsquo;t expect. During the hottest and
stickiest two weeks of summer a couple of years ago, we experienced a complete
and utter failure of the works Gemini Galaxy to &lsquo;boot&rsquo;. Once we&rsquo;d got it
booted, then the number of disk errors which were recovered by the retry logic
were out of all proportion to those previously experienced or experienced
later. We tried the lot, cleaned the filters, ran the thing with the lid off
to keep it cooler, changed the drives, everything. Still no better. We noted
that the disks read more easily towards the middle of the disk than the outer
tracks, and if we PIPed to a newly formatted disk (preferably an old one)
everthing was Ok. It all pointed to the disks being in trouble, but why? This
situation went on for some days until a wandering disk rep. happened to drop
by. After greeting him with my usual banter specially reserved for getting rid
of people trying to sell me things, I told him his blankety-blank disks were
useless anyway as we couldn&rsquo;t get them to boot. His cool reply was that, &lsquo;What
did I expect when the temperature was in the eighties, and the humidity was
99%!!&rsquo; It turns out (quite logically) that disks absorb atmospheric moisture
