not use quite such big integers, so it seems to be producing less efficient
code for this benchmark. It is not easy to be sure about this, however, on
account of the stopwatch and its operator... All the routines using just
integers suffer from the same &ldquo;negative improvement&rdquo;, but look what happens
with Realarithmetic! HP5 cuts the time down quite well, while Compas is
nowhere near even HP4. And when it comes to the (number) crunch, in Program
Maths, HP5 is probably about 20% faster than HP4, even though it is doing a
lot more work in the loop counting part of the program. The &ldquo;*&rdquo; mark indicates
that I didn&rsquo;t believe the timing I got for Program Value, using Compas. Either
the compiler is very efficient at calling procedures when there are no
parameters, or this is a result of the fact that Compas procedures are not
recursive unless you tell it they should be. (In other words, it does not
normally set up a new local workspace every time a procedure begins, which
proper Pascal compilers have to do.) Or perhaps I compiled it wrong...

Since writing that paragraph, I have read Polydata&rsquo;s remarks in the last
<a href="../text/"></a>issue, and appreciate that much of what I have just said about their compiler
may well be hopelessly wrong, when applied to version 2. It would be nice if
they could let us know how fast the new version runs the benchmarks. I was
pleased to see that they are now taking a much more sensible line over
royalties on your programs, too...
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the bottom line of the table is the one you are buying, and the
<?php externalLink("HSA-88B"); ?>
is clearly pulling its weight there. By comparison, the Sage&nbsp;II, with
its 68000 processor, using the well known p-system, and costing rather a lot
more than my system, takes 7.6 seconds to run Program Maths. And if you run
this:

using MBASIC, you will find it takes about 25 seconds, running at 4MHz, even
though it is using K%, which is faster than plain K. I have also written some
other test programs which lean more heavily on the maths processor than the
benchmarks do, because they don&rsquo;t really probe very deeply into the realms of
number crunching, and there is an even more noticeable improvement, but space
does not permit the inclusion of these programs. They don&rsquo;t actually do
anything useful, anyway, unless anyone wants a list of all the prime numbers
lower than MAXINT...
</p>
<p>
If you want the answers to your sums faster, or just want to be the envy
of all the people with slow computers, then the HSA-88B has to be a good buy.
As soon as I have taken my Open University exam for this year, and have some
time to myself and Marvin, I am hoping to write some fancy stuff, using
<?php externalLink("Pluto","",""); ?>,
HSA-88B (pity they couldn&rsquo;t have given it a nice name &ndash; what does the 88B bit
refer to?) and HP5. Real 3D programs need fast matrix calculating routines to
make them work. See in particular the article in December PCW for an idea of
what can be done. Perhaps I need an array of HSA-88B&rsquo;s, say four of them,
running in parallel...
