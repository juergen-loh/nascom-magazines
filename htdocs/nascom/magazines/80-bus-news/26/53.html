When using acoustic (or direct connected) 300&nbsp;BAUD modems with Prestel,
there have to be snags of course, firstly, the 300&nbsp;BAUD service is restricted
to only one computer, with a limited number of ports for its modems. This
means that it is often engaged during the day, but evenings are a different
story. I&rsquo;ve no way of knowing, but I would guess that out of business hours,
the 300&nbsp;BAUD service is the quietest of the lot on the grounds that no-one
knows it&rsquo;s there. Another nasty is that BT don&rsquo;t offer preferential rates for
that number. If you live outside London, then dialing that number will get
charged at trunk call rates, worse, because the data rate is one quarter of
the normal Prestel data rate, everything takes four times as long to receive.
The last flaw in the scheme is gaining access to Prestel, you require an
individual access code which is many characters long. I&rsquo;m not saying how many
characters, just in case someone tries a bit of code cracking and hits my code
by sheer good/bad luck; mind you that could be expensive, because if you get
the access code wrong a couple of times, Prestel tells you you are an idiot,
and disconnects the line. You get your access code when you apply for the
Prestel service. They ask you what device you intend to use. You reply,
&ldquo;Personal computer&rdquo;. They ask you what. You say, &ldquo;BBC&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;Oric&rdquo; or some other approved device depending upon the computer you are
using, or if you are using a 300&nbsp;BAUD modem, you must make sure you get logged
onto the Kipling computer, then you say &ldquo;300&nbsp;BAUD modem.&rdquo;. Typically the
person taking the logging details knows nothing about the 300&nbsp;BAUD service so
you&rsquo;ll have to tell them. After a while, you get your access code, and given
suitable software, away you go.

<p>
Now to suitable software, I&rsquo;m writing a bit to make the
<?php externalLink("Climax"); ?>
card look
like a Prestel display, &rsquo;cos it&rsquo;s got colour and all that. But David
Parkinson&rsquo;s dumb terminal routine works well enough to extract textual data
and Ward Christenssen&rsquo;s MODEM 7 works well for textual data with the advantage
that you can store the incoming data and use it for testing Climax colour
routines, etc. If you&rsquo;ve got a Winchester Technology colour card collecting
dust, you&rsquo;re laughing, just plug it in and with the simplest of dumb terminal
type software, you&rsquo;re away.

Apart from Prestel with Micronet, which costs, there are a lot of
telephone numbers with modems and active computers on the end. There are
billboards, companies advertising, all sorts of things, most of which allow
access for nothing. A whole bunch were published in PCW a couple of months
back and some of these can provide hours of endless fun (providing someone
else is paying the phone bill). One person I know tried the Swedish number
published, hoping that the Swedes with their liberated views had something
interesting to say. Unfortunately the computer replied in Swedish, so he&rsquo;s
none the wiser.

<u>HDLC and Packet Radio</u>
</h3>
<p>
On the subject of serial communucations, I have recently come across
references to a subject called &lsquo;Packet Radio&rsquo; which has raised some interest
in the States. On first reading this was pretty meaningless due to the sketchy
nature of the odd paragraphs that appeared over here. However, Practical
Wireless has seen fit to reprint the whole of one American explanatory
article, and with a sigh (Oh no, not another protocol!), I sat down to read
it. Now it turns out that &lsquo;Packet Radio&rsquo; is not &lsquo;just another protocol&rsquo;, but a
radio adaptation of an old enemy, HDLC. Now I say old enemy, as not so long
ago one of the 80BUS board manufacturers asked me to look into high speed
synchronous serial communications, in other words, making micros talk to
