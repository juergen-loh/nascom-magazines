GEMPEN, then his registration document will have been returned to Gemini, who
as far as I know have not circularized the owners of GEMPEN. This is probably
because they are more interested in supporting WORDSTAR than later versions of
DISKPEN, see the WORDSTAR commercial on vol 2 <a href="../text/"></a>iss 5 p 24 in the middle of the
unsolicited appraisal of DISKPEN. [Ed. &ndash; Unsolicited?? Well, I believe you!
But the reason that the comment (not commercial) was added was to make sure
that anyone reading the article was aware that the &lsquo;equal space justification&rsquo;
that the article was printed in is a feature of WordStar, and that PEN output
would be visually different. You wouldn&rsquo;t like anyone to be mis-led, would
you?] What the Editor omitted to say was they he has a conversion program
that turns PEN text into WORDSTAR text, so that either is equally acceptable.

<u>COMAL&ndash;80</u>
</h3>
<p>
Mr Davies also asks about COMAL-80 and the disappearance of the tape
based version. The simple answer is that although it existed, it didn&rsquo;t work
properly in tape based form. The trouble stems from the way in which it tries
to save a file to tape and the simplfied workings of RP/M compared with CP/M.
I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what was wrong, but it was to do with COMAL checking
to see if a file existed and RP/M faking an answer which implied it did, at
this point COMAL tried to delete the file and found it couldn&rsquo;t. That doesn&rsquo;t
look right, but it was something on those lines, resulting in COMAL getting in
a knot. As far as I know no-one has attempted to cure the problem.

<u>Disk Content</u>
</h3>
<p>
Mr. Piper of Sheffield writes complaining of the disk based content of
the mag, understanding that we publish what we&rsquo;re sent. He goes on to write
that he&rsquo;d like disks, but lack of pennies prohibits this, &ldquo;Could someone
provide bare pcbs, etc, to allow these facilities to be provided as pocket
money allows.&rdquo; The simple answer is yes, a few of the early
<?php externalLink("Henelec","",""); ?>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM805"); ?>
single density controllers are still available in both &lsquo;pcb plus
circuits&rsquo; form, and in complete kit form at much reduced prices. Disk drives
are still a problem, but drives are becoming cheaper and can be bought new for
about &pound;170 each by reading the small ads. Secondly, there are few second hand

<?php externalLink("GM809","G809",""); ?>&rsquo;s
knocking around which have been taken as &lsquo;trade in&rsquo;s&rsquo; for the
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
controller at about &pound;70.00, likewise some dealers have second hand
drives, traded in for the same reasons, at prices between &pound;100 and &pound;150
depending upon condition. So it&rsquo;s worth phoneing around. The last pricey thing
on the list is an operating system. This I&rsquo;m afraid is going to hurt the
pocket whatever you opt for. One dealer has a few old CP/M&nbsp;1.4&rsquo;s for the
<?php externalLink("GM805"); ?>
available, but CP/M&nbsp;2.2 for most other permutations will cost about &pound;120.
Polydos is a viable alternative for the Nascom owner, and cheaper, but will
cost about &pound;103. The answer is that you won&rsquo;t get much change out of &pound;300 to
put a disk system together, but I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s a lot cheaper than you
thought. The above prices include VAT.

<u>NASPEN Problem</u>
</h3>
<p>
Mr Piper also comes up with a permutation problem with NASPEN. He says he
can&rsquo;t do a Read or a Join with Nascom&nbsp;1 running NAS-SYS&nbsp;3. Now this is one I
haven&rsquo;t heard of. As far as I know, it works, which suggests the EPROMs are
corrupt. Get them reprogrammed by Henry&rsquo;s, but check which version, there was
a NASPEN VN.1 and a NASPEN VN:1 (subtle difference), the VN:1 version was
later. As I said, as far as I know, they should both work as neither Read nor
Join was monitor dependant.
