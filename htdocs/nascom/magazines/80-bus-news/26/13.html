Both tape and EPROM versions of NASPAS are supplied with two booklets, a
programming manual and an operating manual. The operating manual contains
information on getting the system going and details on running the editor, the
compiler and other miscellaneous information. The details in both manuals are
quite sufficient and well written, but the programming manual, whilst
accurate, is rather formal and could be rather heavy going for a novice to
Pascal. The programming manual describes the format of Pascal, including data
types, declaration expressions, statements, procedures, functions, parameters,
etc, all very carefully. But I found the lack of examples made it somewhat
difficult to define problems and sort out syntax errors when I got going. A
good book on Pascal programming would seem to be a great help as well as the
information supplied.
</p>
<p>
The tape version was supplied on a high quality cassette and loaded
easily at 1200&nbsp;BAUD. The EPROM version is supplied as six 2716 and runs from
D000H to FFFFH, and is started in the same way as the Nascom Basic, that is,
typing &lsquo;J&rsquo; for cold start, plus the memory space to be allocated, otherwise
NASPAS defaults to all available memory allocated. &lsquo;Z&rsquo; warm starts NASPAS.
</p>
<p>
I had some difficulty with the EPROM version, as the title on the screen
and the keyboard input routines appeared to be corrupt. As a listing is not
supplied, I was unable to check the code myself, so the chips were returned,
only to be sent back with &lsquo;no fault found&rsquo;. As the fault was still apparent, I
resorted to checksumming the EPROMS and found that one would occasionally give
a different result. I made a copy of the chip to tape, and then erased and
reblew the EPROM. After that my troubles disappeared. The fault seeming to be
poor programming of the chip in question.
</p>
<p>
A good selection of functions are available including trig. functions,
string functions, some graphics functions and port I/O. Also external machine
code routines can be called, and external printer patches are provided to
allow listings to be made from the editor.
</p>
<p>
In use, programs are written with the NASPAS editor which uses screen
editing facilites similar to NAS-SYS with the exception that a line may be up
to 80 characters long, the text scrolling sideways to the left off the screen
as text is added to the right. When first used, the effect can be a little
disconcerting. Editing of lines which &lsquo;wrap round&rsquo; the screen can also be
achieved by moving the cursor to the correct position on the screen, editing,
and then pressing the ENTER key.
</p>
<p>
Once a program is written, it may be compiled and the error codes are
displayed one at a time on the top line of the screen with the cursor pointing
to the approximate place of error within the text. The meanings of the error
codes are listed in the back of the manual. When a successful compile is
achieved, then a message is displayed giving the memory locations of the
source code, and the also of the machine code program produced.
</p>
<p>
Both the source code and the machine code produced can be loaded to and
from tape, with or without file names. The machine code program produced can
be reloaded and run &lsquo;stand alone&rsquo; so long as the run-time program in NASPAS is
present at the same time.
</p>
<p>
It appears to be very versatile and very fast. A comparison drawn with
Nascom Basic indicates truly remarkable speed, and programs containing masses
of &lsquo;IF&rsquo; statements and the like cause no problems at all. Most of my programs
are written for amateur RTTY operation and in the past have been mostly
machine code; the Pascal versions appear to run with almost machine code
speed.
</p>
<p>
Overall NASPAS appears to be a very versatile package as supplied, and is
an excellent addition and alternative to the Nascom ROM Basic.&rdquo;
