Some of the above I got from Belectra&rsquo;s part of the documentation, which
is clear, if rather brief; much of the rest of the information about the 9511
came from &ldquo;Modern Microprocessor System Design&rdquo; by Daniel R McGlynn. Also
included in the information Belectra give you are details of the ports used by
the board, but there is no need to repeat them here. If you do reconfigure the
board to other ports, you can easily patch the Pascal compiler&rsquo;s run time
routines to take account of this, as the address of the data port is stored at
&pound;0103, and the address of the control port is at &pound;0104. (Quoted from Hisoft&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Functional Differences between Hisoft Pascal 5D and Hisoft Pascal 4D&rdquo;, which
comes with the Pascal manual.)

Belectra&rsquo;s documentation gives brief but very clear examples of how to
program the board using Z80 assembly language, and it is clear that this is
quite an easy job, when compared with writing your own set of floating point
routines. The thing is, the rest of the program is going to be a bit of a pig,
if it uses the calculations the board can do, to any great extent. I once
wrote a biorhythm program in 1K of Z80 code (and I hasten to point out that I
do not believe in biorhythms!), and it was no fun at all, especially the bit-
that drew the sine waves. So I will move hurriedly on to the sensible way of
doing things, namely with high level languages, pausing only to note that if
you do program the board in assembler, then there is no reason why the Z80 can
not get on with something else while the HSA-88B is working. For instance, it
could be preparing the next data to be worked on. It could just as easily be
controlling another HSA-88B, if you have the money to run more than one of
them! Then you would need to write some nice queue handling routines,
especially if there was another board that also ran independantly, like the
Pluto. I think you had better forget that sort of programming style, unless
you are a real masochist. After all, you are supplied with Hisoft Pascal 5
along with the board, and Hisoft&rsquo;s compilers are renowned for the speed of the
code they produce. HP5 uses the HSA-88B for all its arithmetical work, which
means that as well as compiling programs that run faster, it also needs a lot
less memory space for its completely rewritten run-time routines. (Sometimes
you can have your cake and eat it too!) If you want to use some other compiler
with the board, or even an interpreter, this is possible, as long as you know
how to do things like modifying the run-time routines the compiler churns out,
or finding the bit of the interpreter you need to change. Belectra give brief
notes about what is required, but also say &ldquo;The only remaining consideration
is whether a particular compiler or interpreter is worth modifying; some
generate code which is so inefficient that even if the HSA-88B performed its
function in zero time there would not be any noticeable difference in overall
program execution speed.&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t tried the patch to MBASIC from the last
issue, as I can&rsquo;t afford MBASIC...

Hisoft Pascal 5D is supplied with the manual for the earlier 4D version,
and six pages of notes concerning the differences between the two compilers,
marked &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; on my copy. The major change, obviously, is the use of
the HSA-88B for all arithmetic. This includes integers, all of which are now
to 32 bit precision. As a result of this, MAXINT is now 2,147,483,647, which
is a big number! I am not at all bothered by the compiler&rsquo;s inability to
handle recursive WITH statements, though there is bound to be someone,
somewhere who thinks this is a fatal flaw! Instead of RANDOM, you now put
RANDOM(X), where X is either zero, or a seed for the random number routine. If
you use 0, the value returned is between 0 and 65535 inclusive, rather than
the old 0 to 255. GOTO (whatever that is) can not transfer execution to
another block. I haven&rsquo;t written a GOTO in Pascal yet, and if I ever need to,
I will be quite surprised. The provisional manual gives the addresses in the
