<h3>
<u>An apology</u>
</h3>
<p>
Sorry; a little late again. My fault. Too much working and socialising
and not enough editing. Anyway, this is the latest effort and I trust that you
enjoy reading it and find a number of useful items in it.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Future issues</u>
</h3>
<p>
I have recently received a number of conflicting letters concerning the
type of article that we publish. Some say &ldquo;I now find very little of interest
in the magazine&rdquo; whilst others say &ldquo;80-BUS News is invaluable&nbsp;&ndash; there is so
much useful information in every issue that is just not available elsewhere&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash;
both of these are actual quotes, both are probably right, but I&rsquo;m pleased to
say that the latter is the more frequent. It obviously depends on your
individual interests, and there is no doubt that there is a fairly wide cross-section
of readership. Really all I can do is repeat, for newcomers, what has
been said before. All articles published in 80-BUS News are non-commissioned
items received from readers. From these potential articles I select a cross-section
of items to cover as wide a range of topics that I believe will be of
reasonably wide interest. In the main this seems to be very successful, but
starting with the
<a href="../../../31/01/text/#page">next issue</a>
I will also start to include the occasional
article that, in my own opinion, is aimed at a much more specialised area than
normal. I await any feedback with interest. Incidentally, this means that if
you have submitted an article that has not yet materialised, you are now in
with a chance!

<h3>
<u>Money</u>
</h3>
<p>
Owing to a little internal problem there are a couple of contributors to
this esteemed publication who have not been remunerated for their efforts, and
with whom we have lost contact. If this is you then please drop us a line
stating the article for which payment is required. We will then try to oblige!
</p>
<h3>
<u>And finally</u>
</h3>
<p>
A belated Happy New Year to all our readers!
