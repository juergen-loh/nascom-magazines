piece of relocatable code which loads the B register with the number of copies
to be printed, calls the Naspen print command, and loops until the B register
is zero. The code can go anywhere except the Naspen workspace. I use 0C80H.
</p>
<p>
ocso0 06 3A LD B, 3AH ; 58 copies wanted
ocs2 CD BAC2 CALL BAC 2H ; Naspen print routine
ocs5 10 FB DINZ 0C82 ; Loop 58 times
</p>
<p>
OC87 C3 B806 JP B806 ; Return to Naspen
</p>
<p>
Load the text into Naspen and leave the cursor pointing at the first character
to be printed. Exit from Naspen using the &lsquo;N&rsquo; command. Enter the above code,
setting the second byte for the number of copies required (in HEX) and execute
at the address loaded. As Naspen prints each copy, the word &lsquo;complete&rsquo; will be
displayed on the screen, this is because this is in the Naspen print command.&rdquo;

sys

&ldquo;Lastly, from Mr Hill of Newhaven a little tweek to SYSN7, the last of the
series of SYS for the Henelec/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini G805 disk sysetm. Mr. Hill uses the
system under CP/M 1.4 with a Gemini GM812 video card:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The modification allows me to use *X to switch between the two keyboard
options. Each successive use of ^X flips between the alternative options. The
control can be used inside all the CP/M packages that I possess, although
there may be some exceptions to this. The listing below shows my modification
to the CP/M 1.4 version of SYS.
</p>
<p>
CICRT1 LD HL,CHCD ; Existing program
cP (HL)
JR NZ, CICRTX ; Jump to new section
LD A,BS ; Existing program
LD (BOPT),A
JR CONIN
3; NEW CODE
CICRIX LD HL,KOPT ; Point to new keyboard option flag
cP 18H ; Is it &ldquo;Xx
JR NZ,CICRT2 ; Skip if not
LD A,1
XOR 1 ; Flip the keyboard option flag ..
LD (HL),A 3&raquo;. and put it back
JR CONING 3; Done
CICRT2 sees ; Continue with SYS&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Looking at the code, something seems a little wrong, where does the
contents of register A come from at CICRTX? I&rsquo;ve just rechecked what I have
typed in and that&rsquo;s correct, but as I don&rsquo;t have a copy of SYSN7 to hand I
hope the code works.

NASPAS Review
</p>
<p>
Here endeth the letters and, lastly, on to a mini review of the Nascom
WASPAS sent in some time ago by Mr. Pennell who doesn&rsquo;t live a million miles
away from me, in Pinner Middlesex, although we&rsquo;ve never met except perhaps
unknowingly over a pile of bean cans in the local Safeways.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I first purchased the tape version of NASPAS, but later exchanged it for
the EPROM version as my Nascom&nbsp;1 has acres of EPROM space being fitted with
two EPROM cards. My Nascom is also fitted with 64K of RAM, an I/O board and an
external CUTS tape interface.
