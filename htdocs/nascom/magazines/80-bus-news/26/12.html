piece of relocatable code which loads the B register with the number of copies
to be printed, calls the Naspen print command, and loops until the B register
is zero. The code can go anywhere except the Naspen workspace. I use 0C80H.

Load the text into Naspen and leave the cursor pointing at the first character
to be printed. Exit from Naspen using the &lsquo;N&rsquo; command. Enter the above code,
setting the second byte for the number of copies required (in HEX) and execute
at the address loaded. As Naspen prints each copy, the word &lsquo;complete&rsquo; will be
displayed on the screen, this is because this is in the Naspen print command.&rdquo;

Lastly, from Mr Hill of Newhaven a little tweek to SYSN7, the last of the
series of SYS for the
<?php externalLink("Henelec","",""); ?>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM805","G805"); ?>
disk sysetm. Mr. Hill uses the
system under CP/M&nbsp;1.4 with a Gemini

video card:

<p class="noindent">
&ldquo;The modification allows me to use ^X to switch between the two keyboard
options. Each successive use of ^X flips between the alternative options. The
control can be used inside all the CP/M packages that I possess, although
there may be some exceptions to this. The listing below shows my modification
to the CP/M&nbsp;1.4 version of SYS.

Looking at the code, something seems a little wrong, where does the
contents of register A come from at CICRTX? I&rsquo;ve just rechecked what I have
typed in and that&rsquo;s correct, but as I don&rsquo;t have a copy of SYSN7 to hand I
hope the code works.

<u>NASPAS Review</u>
</h3>
<p>
Here endeth the letters and, lastly, on to a mini review of the Nascom
NASPAS sent in some time ago by Mr. Pennell who doesn&rsquo;t live a million miles
away from me, in Pinner Middlesex, although we&rsquo;ve never met except perhaps
unknowingly over a pile of bean cans in the local Safeways.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I first purchased the tape version of NASPAS, but later exchanged it for
the EPROM version as my Nascom&nbsp;1 has acres of EPROM space being fitted with
two EPROM cards. My Nascom is also fitted with 64K of RAM, an I/O board and an
external CUTS tape interface.
