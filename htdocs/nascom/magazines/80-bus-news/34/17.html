is the only authorised method of implementing
<?php externalLink("GM862","",""); ?>/<?php externalLink("GM802","802"); ?>
RAM on this system.
Explicit examples are shown in the GM862 Manual of how to select each 64K page
via switch ICl, disable Extended addressing and enable Page mode via poles 4 &amp;
5 of switch IC2, and disable the 4K/8K &lsquo;Common Area&rsquo; via poles 2 &amp; 3 so that
an entire 64K memory bank is switched each time a different page is accessed.
As existing software for Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini Page Mode operation already provides
simultaneous Read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Write to the top of each memory bank or page, a hardwired
Common Area is NOT required to run CP/M&nbsp;2 etc. on the GM862. Future
developments like CP/M PLUS may need this facility however, and dedicated
experimenters could find it interesting.

<h3>
A HARD&shy;WARE FIX
</h3>
<p>
When the GM862&rsquo;s DIL switches were carefully set up as per the manual to
provide 4 pages of 64K, the Nascom refused to work under CP/M and other DOSs,
or even good old Nas-Sys. It would run all systems as usual with the old
<?php externalLink("GM802","802"); ?>
board without page mode selected, but would not boot CP/M when this board was
set to read and write as page zero. Under Nas-Sys it seemed that none of the
new board&rsquo;s RAM was being addressed, while the old 64K board could be
addressed when setup as any of the four pages. I suspected that the GM862 was
not responding to the 80BUS /RAMDIS signal but without a circuit diagram was
disinclined to poke about with over &pound;300 worth of brand new hardware.
Nevertheless I could have kicked myself when our esteemed Editor told me
brightly some days later that a pull-up resistor was needed on (you&rsquo;ve guessed
it) the /RAMDIS line when using the 256K board with a Nascom. All Gemini CPU
boards have pull-ups, on some (open collector) bus lines, which the original
Nas-Bus specification expects to find on the auxilliary board/s. Note also
that /NASIO, /NASMEM and DBDR signals are not provided on the GM862. Gemini
have provided the mounting holes and pads for the necessary 4k7 (4.7k&nbsp;ohm)
resistor quite close to the /RAMDIS edge connector (pin No.9) and the +5V
termination pad of electrolytic capacitor C6, but for some strange reason have
not laid tracks between the resistor pads and these points. Only short links
are needed however, and the layout allows the resistor to be inserted and its
leads bent and soldered neatly to the capacitor pad and edge pin track.

<h3>
MODIFYING SIMON
</h3>
<p>
With the resistor fitted, each 64K page of the 256K RAM could be accessed
via Nas-Sys and, with page&nbsp;0 selected, would support programs and DOSs running
under Nas-Sys. CP/M still refused to boot-up however, and the clue to the
solution of that problem is to be found in the manual under Note 1 of Section
4 &ndash; SOFT&shy;WARE IMPLICATIONS. This states that the GM862 Page-Mode latch is
cleared on RESET, disabling its memory until any given page is selected by
writing to Port 0FFh. The standard Gemini CP/M auto-boot EPROMS and versions
2.0 or later of RP/M for the
<?php externalLink("GM811"); ?>
and
<?php externalLink("GM813"); ?>
CPU boards, include
initialisation code to select Page&nbsp;0 on start-up or RESET. Earlier software
and firmware for the Nascom has no such code and so it must be modified. The
routine is simple and fortunately there is ample space within SIMON to
accomodate it. My method was to change the first jump table instruction at the
begining of SIMON to go to the Page&nbsp;0 selection routine, and when this is
completed a jump is made back to the original target address. The A register
and Flags are saved and recovered to allow the routine to be portable i.e. to
be used in other locations or boot systems. The assembled patch listing for
SIMON 1 located at F000h is shown below and can be easily be adapted as
required:&ndash;
