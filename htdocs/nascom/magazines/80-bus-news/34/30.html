exists by what it is in the correct place, and what isn&rsquo;t. If you can&rsquo;t even
find the EPROM, then the fault may lie in the /CS decoding, or the enable to
the output buffer. It is at times like these that a &ldquo;scope (or logic probe) is
useful, especially when used in conjunction with a complex test program like:
</p>
<p>
0D00 2100B0 LD HL, OB000h : Load address of ROM
0D03 &laquo;=7E LOOP: LD A,(CHL) ; Access the ROM
O0D04 18FD JR LOOP ; Continue
</p>
<p>
A tight loop like this allows you to synchronise a &ldquo;scope easily, and to
follow various signals through the circuit.
</p>
<p>
If everthing checks out to this point, but problems still exist in
executing programs in the EPROMs, then it looks like its a case of switching
on wait-states. (Or else revising the modifications to generate an earlier /cs
signal&nbsp;.)

CLIMAX PROBLEMS (No it&rsquo;s not that type of Agony column) &ndash;
</p>
<p>
It has come to my notice that somebody has problems in trying to use the
Climax card in a Gemini Network system. After initial suspicions of the
software, it was finally realised that some Network systems had been shipped
fitted with a particular model of power-supply which did not provide a-5v
supply &ndash; a fact that didn&rsquo;t matter with the supplied boards (GM813 CPU + RAM,
IVC, etc). The Climax, however, uses 4116 RAMS (which require a &ndash;5V supply),
and so when this oversight was rectified.... This struck a chord with me,
because I can remember doing something similar several years ago. I hadnt
bothered to wire the -l12v supply through the backplane because I didn&rsquo;t use
it, and then some months later came to connect a serial printer to the RS232
interface....
