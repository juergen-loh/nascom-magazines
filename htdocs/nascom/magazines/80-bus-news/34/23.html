My only critisism of these centres on UNSPOOL, for which only source is
supplied, as it would not compile with M80 until tweaked a little. This is one
program that should have been supplied as a COM file. Having said that, the
source of UNSPOOL supplies the solution of how to write programs that can
relocate themselves (and also reveals the purpose of the &lsquo;r&rsquo; on every second
line of SYS listings).

Well that was a brief review! Not so much a review as a list of what&rsquo;s on
the disk. Considering the number of useful programs packed onto the disk it
must be value for money as are both CCPZ and BDOSZ.
</p>
<p>
This magazine also represents excellent value for money (a Superbrain
friend of mine eyed it enviously). Readers, support your magazine with more
letters and articles; Editor, what has happened to all the issues this year?
