Configuring Soft&shy;ware
</h3>
<p>
There are other ways to do it, but the above code works on both of my
Nascoms, and CP/M, CCPZ etc, boot up and run with either
<?php externalLink("GM862"); ?> or
<?php externalLink("GM802"); ?> RAM
boards installed. Having got thus far, there was still the job of configuring
CP/M to actually drive the other memory page/s as <span class="uppercase">Ramdisk</span>. If Gemini&rsquo;s
CONFIG.COM is available for the version of CP/M used, then it&rsquo;s a doddle. One
simply selects Menu option 8 (7 on some versions) and if you are using the
GM862, have SIMON in EPROM at F000h, and run 60K CP/M or whatever, enter 3 for
the number of extra pages and 60 for the Kilobyte size of each page. By
selecting the appropriate number of pages, CONFIG can accommodate up to three
additional 64K
<?php externalLink("GM802"); ?>
boards in the same manner, but do NOT specify more boards
or pages of RAM than are installed because the system will crash and/or fail
to boot. Test the system by typing M: to select the <span class="uppercase">Ramdisk</span>, when the M&gt; or
M0&gt; prompt should appear. A DIR command should respond with a NO FILE message.
Return to &lsquo;normal&rsquo; via an A: command and type STAT M: when the response should
indicate between 172K and 178K &lsquo;bytes free&rsquo; if three 60K pages are in use. If
only one 60K page is in use the response will be a (disappointing) 52K to 58K
depending upon the size of the BIOS and the allocated <span class="uppercase">Ramdisk</span> Directory. Try
PIPing and STATing programs around between Disk and RAM to ensure that all is
well. SWEEP may also be used, but the versions written in high level code
hang-up if zero sized files are transmitted and exhibit a few other minor
bugs. However NSWEEP 2.07, a later Z80 code version, has behaved faultlessly
with <span class="uppercase">Ramdisk</span>s. The proven configuration on the Disk system tracks may now be
SYSGENed onto other disks or the configuration process can be repeated as
required.

SYS Assembly

<p>
To activate Page mode <span class="uppercase">Ramdisk</span> operation under later versions of SYS
requires that module SYSB1 be re-assembled using M80 with the appropriate
software switches set as follows:&ndash;
