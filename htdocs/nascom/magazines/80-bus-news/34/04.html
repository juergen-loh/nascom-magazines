They have even agreed to give me a list of registered NasDos users to
assist in expanding the NasDos Users&rsquo; Circle. As to what have they been doing
&ndash; well, I can answer that at least in part. They have been developing a CAD
system now called Lotti II. As a professional engineer, I can say that this
is an excellent product and could well transform their sales forecasts. If
any readers are thinking of buying a CAD system, then make sure you see Lotti
before parting with green stuff.

b) The NasDos Users circle is now actually happening &ndash; thanks mostly to
Roger Dowling. Hopefully this circle will grow as it becomes better known.

c) The recent article in your magazine comparing various colour cards for
Nas Bus/80-BUS was very useful &ndash; it was the final straw that prompted me to
invest &pound;150 on the Nascom AVC. Incidentally, I had CP/M&nbsp;2.2 installed at the
same time with the Business &amp; Leisure switch to select either CP/M or NasDos.
This is extremely handy since it allows files to be transferred from NasDos
disks to CP/M disks by moving to middle memory before switching formats. They
still need modifying to run under CP/M of course &ndash; should keep me busy for the
next 999 years! I have already got NasSys&nbsp;3 working under CP/M by following
the instructions in Chris Blackmore&rsquo;s Monitor.COM article which was found in
an early Nascom N.....tter, as modified by Chris Bowden in the next issue &ndash;
thanks to both gents.

Lucas/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom attitutude; 80-BUS irregularity
</h3>
<p>
Thanks for the latest issue of 80-BUS News (vol 3 issue 2) and the
questionnaire. I hope that lots of readers return them.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m not at all surprised to read about the demise of the Nascom
Newsletter &ndash; which appears to reflect the generally &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t care less&rsquo;
attitude of Lucas/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom to Nascom owners. Mr Scadden may have had more luck
than most in that the above firm actually acknowledged his letters &ndash; they
ignore my requests for information or pricelists and seem unwilling to supply
spares in less than trade quantities. A great pity!
</p>
<p>
I would also like to reinforce Mr Scadden&rsquo;s plea for more regular issues
of the magazine; perhaps an increase in the part-time editorial staff would
help so that pressure of work at Gemini would not cause the erratic
appearances to which we have had to accustom ourselves. From the potential
and actual contributors&rsquo; point of view, I hope that the replies to the
questionnaires will be published and that we will be told what types of
article are required, and, having put our minds in gear, and articles on tape
or disk, that you will let us know whether or not the contribution is suitable
and roughly when it will appear. This would do much to avoid the annoyance
which contributors experience with the present system, to which M. Dasnoy
referred. In spite of previous vicissitudes, I do feel that the magazine is
very useful and it has a great deal more potential now that it is effectively
the only one catering for 80-BUS users.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, Dr P.D. Coker, Orpington, Kent

<p class="noindent">
[Ed. &ndash; It is certainly our intention to publish a summary of the information
gleaned from the questionnaires, and hopefully this will be in the next issue.
We are also forever hopeful that we can achieve improved regularity of the
magazines, although this has never been our strongest point!! Finally, it is
our intention during 1985 to implement a much faster feedback system to
potential contributors on whether an article is to be published or not.]
