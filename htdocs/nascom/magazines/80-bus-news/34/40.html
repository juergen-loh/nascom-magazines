specified in the Gemini CPU card manual. Connecting the computer to the modem
is then dead simple; all you then need is a cable with a male plug at one end
and a female socket at the other with each pin connected to its corresponding
number, ie, 2 &ndash; 2; 3 &ndash; 3; 4 &ndash; 4; 5 &ndash; 5; 6 &ndash; 6; 7 &ndash; 7; 8 &ndash; 8; 20 &ndash; 20.

4) Connecting To BT
</h3>
<p>
Connecting to BT is something of a grey area. Presumably if you buy a brand
spanking new modem, ie, spend more that &pound;100 and it is BT approved with a BT
jack plug, you can plug it straight in and off you go. Surplus modems, even
ex-Telecom, are, however, a different ball game since:
</p>
<table class="bbs-access">
<tr><td>i</td><td>When becoming surplus they probably lose immediate BT approval.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ii</td><td>They generally do not have a correct jack plug on them when you buy them.
As far as I understand the current regulations, you are supposed to call
BT up to put a correct plug on your modem to work with your existing
phone.
<br>
Technically, if you do not comply with the above you can be prosecuted by
BT for using illegal equipment especially if when you wire it up, you
make a mistake and damage BT equipment. However, I am sure many readers
have at least wired their own extension and adding a modem is similar.</td></tr>
<tr><td>iii</td><td>The 2b modem has a two-wire connection to BT, this is to the red and
white wires in current BT coding ie, pins 2 &amp; 5 of the new wiper style
socket. If you have a Senator style multi-extension system this also
works.
<br>
Wire your phone in parallel to the modem, the best way to do this would
be to wire an extension box with 2 sockets one for the phone, the other
for the modem. If you feel at all uneasy about this either get a BT
engineer who you know to do it, or get BT to do it officially.</td></tr>
<tr><td>iv</td><td>For Nascom&nbsp;2 owners with no RS232 control signals try and find out how
many control signals the modem needs, some may only require DTR which
could easily be faked.</td></tr>

5) More On UKM715
</h3>
<p>
UKM715 as supplied by Henry&rsquo;s is about 64K of source well commented with a
single patch area at the start. There are source copies either for Macro-80
or MAC, the Macro-80 version contains a Nascom&nbsp;2 set of port numbers so
somebody has got it working. There is also an installation program UKINSTL
for those of you who get a .COM file which saves you assemblling it. For
those interested in telexing, a Telex utility is available called UKTLX.

6) Testing Your Handiwork
</p>
<p>
Having built all this marvellous equipment, what will it do? Well, every
month PCW prints a list of public access networks with tone standards and
operating times. The problem with quite a few of these is that they operate
only in the evenings when phone calls are a bit cheaper, most of them only
