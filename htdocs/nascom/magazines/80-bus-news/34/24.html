There must be a fair number of Nascom&nbsp;1 owners who have wondered how to
connect up a series of Licon keys in the 10 spare holes in the mounting frame
so that they actually do something useful. Compared with the Nascom&nbsp;2
keyboard, the original Nascom&nbsp;1 keyboard lacks the following keys:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Graphics, Cursor Home, Cursor Up, Down, Right and Left, Control,
right and left square brackets and a Shift key next to the &lsquo;Z&rsquo; key.
</p>
<p>
Provision of the facilities offered by these would make many aspects of the
Nascom&nbsp;1 a great deal more user-friendly, particularly when screen-editing
facilities are required or supported as in Nas-Sys or Naspen, for example.

in
<a href="../../../../inmc-80-news/02/01/text/#page">INMC80 issue&nbsp;2</a> gave details of the
connections for an additional Shift key but there were still 9 holes to fill
in on the keyboard. I acquired some keys and tops from B &amp; L Micros
(Lucas/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom were a bit sniffy about orders less than &pound;25); new Licon keys
are a bit pricey (about &pound;1.50, tops about 60p but Nascom dealers may have some
ex-equipment, or you may be able to acquire a defunct Nascom keyboard and
carefully (with a solder sucker and patience), extract what you need. You
will also need 1 each of 22R, 1K and 2K2&nbsp;ohm 0.25 watt 5 % resistors and some
fine, PVC insulated wire (NOT enamelled). Note that this modification will
nullify any guarantee on the keyboard and DONT attempt it unless you have a
steady hand. Licon keys must be used &ndash; the usual keyboard &lsquo;N.0.&rsquo; switch
won&rsquo;t work in this circuit. After the conversion the keyboard will be
equivalent in its functions to a Nascom&nbsp;2.
<a href="../../../../inmc-80-news/05/30/text/#article1">A short article by David Pears</a>
dealing with this keyboard appeared in
<a href="../../../../inmc-80-news/05/01/text/#page">INMC80 issue&nbsp;5</a>
and shows the majority
of the &lsquo;new&rsquo; keys connected to bit D6 of the data bus and their relationship
to the driver lines from the 74145 (IC&nbsp;5 on both types of board).
</p>
<p>
There were at least 2 issues of keyboard &ndash; issue A boards have tracks running
very close to some of the new key pins which will have to be cut and re-routed
as necessary but there are convenient gaps in all the right places on the
issue B boards. The issue letter is in the top left hand corner of the
underside of the board next to the Reset key. Having turned the board over
to find out its issue letter (and gender), arrange it so that the space bar is
nearest you and place a ruler along the pins of the top (numeric) keys. Draw
a line about 2&Prime; long at the left-hand end with a fine point indelible marker &ndash;
with luck this line will enable you to locate the pin positions for the square
bracket keys! Draw a similar line 1&Prime; long on the right hand end of the next
(QWERTY) row of keys. The third row needs a 1&Prime; line on the left hand and
right hand ends of this (ASDF) row. Another 1&Prime; line on the right hand end of
the ZXCV row follows and finally a line on either side of the Space bar pins,
exactly 0.75&Prime; below the ZXCV row, extending 4.5&Prime; either side of the key pins.

<p>
If you look at the base of a Licon key, you will find that the terminal pins
are assymetrically arranged, as in the diagram:
