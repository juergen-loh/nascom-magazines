INTRODUCTION
</h3>
<p>
The Gemini GM862 is a 256K RAM board that supports Page-Mode addressing
when used with Nascom&nbsp;2 or Gemini GM811 CPU boards, memory mapped Extended
Addressing when used with the Gemini GM813 CPU/RAM board, and Direct
addressing within the 512K 80-BUS address range when used with the Gemini
GM888 8088 CPU board. Although its advanced features are intended for use with
current (and future) Gemini 8 bit and 16 bit products, owners of more
venerable Nasbus/80-BUS machines can also put it to good use as a Virtual or
RAM disk &ndash; given that they already have at least one Disk Drive in operation.
The advent of 256K and 512K memory boards has led to used 64K GM802 boards
being offered for sale at modest prices as professional users (and fanatical
amateurs) upgrade their machines. This means that &lsquo;normal&rsquo; Nascomaniacs can
get to experiment with Paged RAM at relatively low cost. This article attempts
to provide a few tips on installing the GM862 or GM802 as a RAMDISK on a
Nascom&nbsp;2 that are absent from, or perhaps beyond the scope of the original
Instruction Manuals.

<p>
Having aquired a Gemini GM862 256K RAM board [Ed. &ndash; Mr. Williams won it
in a contest, but perhaps is too modest to say so!] the task remained of
implementing it on either of my trusty Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini computers. Each of these
has a Nascom&nbsp;2 CPU, GM812 IVC, GM809 FDC and (originally) a GM802 64K RAM
board, plus interchangeable I/O, EPROM, and Programmer facilities. CP/M or
Nas-Sys and various DOSs are available on both by means of switches. One
machine is housed in a Kenilworth case while the other is built into a Vero
card frame. Currently the 256K board is installed in the Kenilworth console,
and both 64Ks are used in the Vero rack, providing respectively 180K and 60K
of RAMDISK with 60K CP/M operating systems. However, to achieve this happy
state a few problems had to be overcome, as shown below.

<h3>
DOCUMENTATION and HARDWARE
</h3>
<p>
First a quick look at the GM862 and its documentation. Mine was an early
production sample, and the original documentation consisted of photocopied A4
sheets without a circuit diagram; however an additional A5 booklet and A3 size
circuit diagrams were supplied within about two weeks of my posting the
request slip thoughtfully provided by Gemini. The Manual omits detailed
discussion of how the circuits work but concentrates strongly on the setting
of the two 8 bit DIL switches and drops carefully concealed hints on other
matters. The information is accurate and some thought has been put into
presenting the various complex modes and options available. The trick is to
pick out ALL the parts vital to your own requirements and avoid bending your
brain on the rest. WARNING! There are (were?) vital omissions about Nascom
usage.
</p>
<p>
As for the board itself; construction was well up to standard and all the
RAM and a few other selected i.c.s are socketed. It has proved to work
reliably on both a friend&rsquo;s Gemini and my own two Nascoms. On the Gemini, the
CM862 worked first time without a hitch in Extended Addressing mode when the
appropriate onboard switches were set according to the detailed manual, and
the software was configured to suit. Extended (memory mapped) addressing
capability is not available on the Nascom&nbsp;2 CPU board, and Page Mode operation
