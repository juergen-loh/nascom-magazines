How to access them there Bulletin Boards by R. D. E. Brown
(Or a better solution to Dr. Dark&rsquo;s Ring of Rust.)
</p>
<p>
1) What You Need
i A computer with an RS232 (V24) interface.
(Nascom&nbsp;2 Owners NB: this generally means including the control signals
but do not despair, read on.)
ii A Modem or acoustic coupler.
iii A terminal program (with file up/down load facilities).
iv Various bits of wire, plugs, your infinite patience, etc.
v A telephone line. (Preferably someone else&rsquo;s to keep your own bill down.)
</p>
<p>
2) Where You Get The Above From
i&amp;v Most readers will already have one.
</p>
<p>
ii Surplus stores; I obtained an ex-GPO Modem 2b from Display Electronics
for &pound;30. The modem only does CCITT V21 300 bd but it is a well-built
device in a very smart box (about the size of a Kenilworth case),
complete with its own PSU.
</p>
<p>
iii CP/M users have it easy here:
Henry&rsquo;s have both the original MODEM 7 program and an improved UK version
called UKM715, so pick a time when they aren&rsquo;t very busy, wander in with
a disk, get down on your knees and grovel, and you might get a copy.
Tape Nascomers, PolyDossers, etc:
Not having tried this myself (you understand), start with a simple rewrite
of one of the terminal programs already published, then progress to
a terminal file saving program by dumping all characters typed into
memory before saving. (Similar to the Prestel program.)
</p>
<p>
iv The wire and plugs bit should be easy, as for the infinite patience,
well, er ...

3) How You Put It All Together
</p>
<p>
Assuming you haven&rsquo;t fallen asleep yet, here&rsquo;s how you get the thing working.
</p>
<p>
Connecting the modem to the computer (serial interfaces, here we go again,
YAWN ee)
</p>
<p>
When the RS232 standard was conceived (7) it was assumed that communication
would proceed thus.

<p>
Computer &ndash;&ndash;&gt; Modem &ndash;&gt; (Telephone) &ndash;&ndash;&gt; Modem &ndash;&ndash;&gt; Computer
</p>
<p>
Computers are always thought of as
Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or just plain Terminals
</p>
<p>
Modems are always thought of as
Data Communications Equipment (DCE) or Hosts
</p>
<p>
as they protect BT from its users by hosting the communication.
</p>
<p>
All computers, therefore, should be wired up as terminals and have a MALE
plug. All modems are hosts and have a FEMALE socket. Thus, for Gemini serial
connector wire a male DB25 plug onto it with transmit data out on pin 2 and
receive data in on pin 3, bring all other control signals out to the plug as
