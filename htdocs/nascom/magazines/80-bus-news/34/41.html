have 1 line so when ringing around, you will find they are virtually always
engaged. So when testing, try the 24 hr ones during expensive call times and
you should get through.

<p>
When testing, set your software into terminal mode and do not plug in your
modem till you hear the high pitch modem answer tone from the other end, then
connect your modem and type a couple of spaces or carriage returns to wake the
other end up. Then follow the instructions as they appear if you get any
problems, then putting your phone down and unplugging your modem will log you
off. Good luck!

7) Where Is All This Leading To?
</h3>
<p>
Having thought long and hard about this it appears to me that 80-BUS
subscribers could communicate far more easily and more frequently through a
bulletin board. Public domain software (80-BUS oriented), letters and
information could easily be moved about without all the hassle of posting
disks, tapes, etc. The 80-BUS Board should, however, be solely for 80-BUS
News subscribers with a name (subscriber no) and password protection scheme.
Such a Bulletin board could replace much of 80-BUS News, although it should
not entirely kill off the newsletter. It may even provide more articles, who
knows!

8) The $64K Question
</h3>
<p>
Who is going to (ought to) set it up???
</p>
<table class="bbs-access">
<tr><td>i</td><td>Not me (cor, what a cop out!)</td></tr>
<tr><td>ii</td><td>Gemini themselves??! After all, 80-BUS is their product and they are
committed to supporting ex-Nascom hardware and they could afford to
donate (hint, hint) much of the necessary hardware. They could also
publish any product news and fixes on the Bulletin board.</td></tr>
<tr><td>iii</td><td>A leading MicroValue Dealer?? or all of them! A MicroValue Dealer could
also provide many bits of product information as well as even enhancing
his own sales by allowing 24 hour credit card orders, assuming that the
necessary security is available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>iv</td><td>80-BUS News! Obviously, one would have thought that this is the best
solution, ie, the Board existing and maintained by 80-BUS News, however
such a system needs a fairly large outlay on hardware which 80-BUS
subscriptions could not cover. Thus, the best solution would be for 80-BUS
News to run the Board in conjuction with hardware and technical
assistance of either Gemini or the MicroValue group or both, in order to
create a mutually beneficial service for Manufacturer, Dealers and most
important of all, Users.</td></tr>

I hope that the above notes are thought-provoking rather than provocative.
