I&rsquo;ve just got the
<a href="../../../32/01/text/#page">April issue of 80-BUS News</a>
(in November&nbsp;! &ndash; honest I&rsquo;m
not complaining) and feel prompted to write after reading
<a href="../../../32/08/text/#article1">Robin Scadden&rsquo;s letter</a>
echoing my disquiet with Lucas Logic and Roger Dowling&rsquo;s article on
<a href="../../../32/35/text/#article1">Nascom Enhanced Basic for Nas-Dos</a>.
</p>
<p>
It starts back in the New Year after reading the
<a href="../../../../nascom-newsletter/34/-1/text/#page">December issue of the Nascom Newsletter</a>
and the &lsquo;advert&rsquo; about Lucas Logic&rsquo;s CP/M Rev. 2.3. This
included details of the 80 column screen available on the
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
and virtual disk
on the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 256K RAM","MAP80 RAM"); ?> card.
I decided to take the plunge and &lsquo;upgraded&rsquo; from Nas-Dos
to CP/M and purchased Nascom Enhanced (XBASIC) for CP/M. So starts the
epic.
</p>
<p>
I checked with Lucas Logic that all new CP/M purchases were of Rev. 2.3,
and they agreed, so I ordered both through the Leeds Computer Centre. You can
guess what happened. I got Rev 2.1. Leeds Computer Centre were very good and
phoned Lucas Logic who said I would have to send my master disk back. This was
done and returned with MDISK.COM, but no documentation despite a note with the
disk requesting it. Of course the damn thing didn&rsquo;t work. After a lot of
costly phone calls by the Leeds Computer Centre, all to no avail, I wrote to
Lucas Logic and eventually received the documentation. Totally useless. MDISK
would still not work. So, I sent Lucas Logic a letter asking for help. No
reply. Like Robin Scadden I can write scathing letters when necessary, so I
sent another letter with a print out of the first 1K of garbage of my MDISK. I
soon (yes SOON!) received a nice reply with a disk with a copy of a working
MDISK and away I went. It really is very good. The ram card is treated just
like a floppy disk from the users point of view and is VERY fast. You get 192K
of file space with the fully populated card. One problem though. It doesn&rsquo;t
work with my XBASIC&nbsp;!!! My first letter has not been replied to. So it&rsquo;s
another unpleasant letter to Lucas Logic. I&rsquo;ll let you know what happens. But
it&rsquo;s very bad form when you HAVE to get nasty to get anywhere with people like
this. It makes me wonder if they&rsquo;re NHS administrators who&rsquo;ve moved to the
Private Sector&nbsp;!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, now I&rsquo;ve got that off my chest, what about the rest of Nascom
CP/M&nbsp;? Well it&rsquo;s just like any other. AVCTXT.COM gives AVC users the 80 column
screen which is really handy, if not essential for wordprocessing. However,
it&rsquo;s a bit slow when scrolling, but very readable because it IS a high
resolution graphics card.
</p>
<p>
There are 47 special keyboard functions which are probably similar to the
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>/<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
plus the ability to use the numeric keys as function keys via the
GRAPH key. These are of course user-definable and there&rsquo;s a neat little
example program to show you how to do it. However, Lucas Logic let themselves
down again. The manual has a table of flags, parameters, etc in it, but when I
asked how the cursor position is stored as the manual doesn&rsquo;t make this clear,
I get no reply. Can anybody else help&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
Like any CP/M you buy it&rsquo;s got all the dross from Digital Research, but
what surprised me most is it&rsquo;s speed. Actually it&rsquo;s lack of it. It&rsquo;s so slow
compared to Nas-Dos, but of course not as versatile (?). How to get the most
out it for the least investment of money&nbsp;? &ndash; see below.
