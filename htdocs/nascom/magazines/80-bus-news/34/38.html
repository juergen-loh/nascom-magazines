off the disk at once&nbsp;!! I discovered this after three nights, when in an
inebriated state I used DDT on a file that had just dumped itself
everywhere but I wanted it to be. (Actually it&rsquo;s been scientifically
proven that with a blood alcohol of approximately 12% you&rsquo;re most
creative&nbsp;!!)

Why Lucas Logic have chosen this tedious file handling systemy is
difficult to determine. I was hoping that XBASIC would do all the file
handling for ME. However, this method has a slight advantage. You can
concoct a file of fixed length from mainy variables. Prepare it for input with
INPUT&nbsp;&pound; &lt;SV&gt;,&lt;I&gt; alone, and then nibble away at the records using INCH$(N).
This speeds things up a bit and you can bung all the data to the variables
immediately afterwards.

What about GXBASIC&nbsp;? Well the commands are the same as the Nas-Dos based
G32 and G48 running with Rom Basic except the &lsquo;SET&rsquo; prefix is dropped.
However, it draws at a much faster rate, and dumping pictures off the disk has
been turbocharged&nbsp;! There is a command to dump graphics from the screen to a
printer, but I can&rsquo;t get that to work either. My printer is a Gemini-10X so
it&rsquo;s probably not compatible. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me at the moment .... but,
perhaps another letter to Lucas Logic&nbsp;?

<p>
So is XBASIC worth sixty quid&nbsp;? Well had I but known I wouldn&rsquo;t have
bought it. If only someone had told me about the CP/M Users Group (UK). This
is an &lsquo;amateur&rsquo; organisation on similar lines to 80-BUS. Membership is &pound;7.50
p.a. with a really good quarterly journal. But, the real benefit is the
software library. Over 250 VOLUMES (YES&nbsp;!!!!) of software in the public domain
i.e. NO copyright. Choose a volume, send a disk with &pound;2.00 for copying and
postage and it&rsquo;s returned tout de suite. Theorectically, you don&rsquo;t need to buy
anything from the &lsquo;big-boys&rsquo; again. If you want more information write to &ndash;

Why havent our great leaders told us this before&nbsp;???
</p>
<p>
So what do I use XBASIC for&nbsp;? Well, it has a really good on screen editor
in the old Nascom tradition, so I use it to write all my letters on! (If I
bought a decent text editor I&rsquo;d have to throw it away and my fiancee would be
very annoyed at the cost.) Actually, this article was prepared on it. The AUTO
command keeps churning out the line numbers as needed, then I edited it to
something vaguely acceptable to our Editor (oh Lord and Master hear my
prayer). Next, saved it to disk as an ASC file and then used EDIT (a much
improved ED.COM from the CP/M Users Group) to remove all the line numbers. Not
very difficult, tedious, but a damn site easier than using EDIT denoveau (from
scratch&nbsp;!).

<p>
With regards to Lucas Logic, I personally think that many computer
companies will be going to the wall next year, and that Lucas Logic will be
one of them, but there won&rsquo;t be anybody to buy them this time.
