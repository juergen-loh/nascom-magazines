80-BUS &ndash; BBC
</h3>
<p>
Could someone please tell me (via the Newsletter) whether anyone has
interfaced an 80-BUS system to a BBC B via the 1 MHz tube?
</p>
<p>
Yours truly, Paul Young, London, W2.

[Ed. &ndash; I wonder if Mr Young would like to contact another of our subscribers
who also sounds like he&rsquo;s from the group Band-Aid &ndash; he just happens to be
called Phil Collins&nbsp;!!]

<h3>
BBC BASIC
</h3>
<p>
Having read Vol 3 Issue 1, I felt compelled to write regarding Dave
Hunt&rsquo;s Bits and especially his article &ldquo;.. and BBC BASIC&rdquo; which I found rather
confusing.
</p>
<p>
After reading this several times I finally concluded that the article
refers to BBC BASIC as found in BBC machines, Electrons, etc. Is Dave Hunt
aware that there is a very good version of BBC BASIC available for Z80 based
machines called BBC BASIC(Z80)?
</p>
<p>
I must admit I was unaware of this fact until May of this year.
</p>
<p>
In April of the previous year, I had saved hard and managed to put
together a Multiboard system working under RP/M and using CCSOFT&rsquo;s GBASIC with
GRAPHPAC. Then I added a disk drive and purchased CP/M. Looking around for a
suitable (and above all, cheap) BASIC language became the next priority.
</p>
<p>
There seemed to be nothing advertised under about &pound;250 + VAT (MBASIC) and
I was almost resolved to buy COMAL or PASCAL instead, when a very helpful Mr
Creutzberg at OFF RECORDS in Clapham told me of this BBC BASIC(Z80) which was
retailing at &pound;125 + VAT.
</p>
<p>
I purchased a copy and have been most satisfied. The program is marketed
by M-Tec of Norwich and was written by RT Russell. It is supplied with many
useful utility programs and HELP files with many example programs. It has its
own Assembler too!
</p>
<p>
All the BBC BASIC commands are supported with the exception of the
colour, graphics and sound commands, but I understand there are moves afoot to
link these with the colour graphics boards eventually.
</p>
<p>
It would be interesting to hear from other Gemini users who have BBC
BASIC(Z80) and to see a review of it in 80-BUS NEWS. I would write one myself
but have no word processing facilities as yet.
</p>
<p>
It is interesting that there has never been an advertisement for BBC
BASIC(Z80) in 80-BUS NEWS and indeed no mention of it. I do not read many
computer mags, I have only ever seen it once advertised there and then only in
a very small space.
</p>
<p>
I can only say that I would recommend this language to anyone and feel
that Dave&rsquo;s comments were a little derogatory. Speaking as someone who has
only ever used BASIC, I found it easy to use, powerful and challenging. I
agree with him that the actual BBC machine is next to useless. Having tried
to write a useful program on one I found that with the DOS and Hi-Res mode in
place, there was about 7K of free memory left and a 2-D array I had to use
meant there was no room to run the program. The same program transferred to
my Gemini ran perfectly well, giving the same screen image without Hi-Res just
on the IVC and there was still 30K free memory left to play with!
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for an excellent publication even if it is often
frustratingly late!
</p>
<p>
Yours truly, Chris Hellen, Colchester
