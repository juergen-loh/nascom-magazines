<h3>
<u>HELP&nbsp;!!!</u>
</h3>
<p>
Seeing various things in the last 80-BUS News reminded me that I had
never got going a V&amp;T tape system that I have. I wonder if there is any
reader in the NW who has one and could advise. I am at the level of an
intelligent dodo as far as this sort of thing is concerned.

<h3>
<u>Booby Prize</u>
</h3>
<p>
As an added incentive for 80-BUS readers to fill in their questionnaires,
may I suggest a personally signed picture of your friend and his, the mighty
Lawrence, as a first prize.
</p>
<p>
For those poor people who do not win the first prize, you could give them
a personally signed picture of Lawrence as a consolation prize.
</p>
<p>
Listen, here&rsquo;s an idea. How about a personally signed picture of
Lawrence as a booby prize!

<h3>
<u>IMP PRINTER RIBBONS</u>
</h3>
<p>
P.A. Cooper of Brentwood, Essex, in
<a href="../../../12/01/text/#page">Apr-Jun issue</a>, was enquiring about
<a href="../../../12/07/text/#article1">re-inking ribbons for his
Imp printer</a>.
I have just replaced the ribbon in my
<?php externalLink("IMP","Imp"); ?>
with a nylon fabric refill for an Epson MX-100 cartridge. The refill was
obtained from Inmac (UK) Ltd, &pound;2.40 (less VAT) each. The minimum postage was
&pound;2, so unless you are buying several refills or other items, one refill is a
bit expensive.
</p>
<p>
To change the ribbon, lay out a sheet of newspaper, carefully prize off
the top of the cartridge and remove the old ribbon. The refill comes wound as
a double coil of ribbon. I put one coil in the cartridge and the other on the
table and feed the ribbon through the feed wheel and the slots. I replaced
the lid and wound in the ribbon from the table, the coil in the cartidge stops
it packing too loosely. Once the ribbon was wound in, the other coil was
placed on the table, and the process repeated. The lid was finally glued on
with a few dabs of &lsquo;UHU&rsquo; ready for next time. I hope this may be of some use
to Imp owners.

<h3>
<u>PolyDos Languages&nbsp;?</u>
</h3>
<p>
Does anyone know of the existence of a high level language other than
BASIC for PolyDos. I have no grumble about the PolyDos BASIC (it is in fact
quite good), but there comes a time when one needs something a little faster
and structured, eg, PASCAL or if one is really feeling brave, &lsquo;C&rsquo;. I have the
Hi-Soft PASCAL HP4, but it is on tape (after disks, tape is too frustrating
