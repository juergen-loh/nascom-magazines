Blotting applications. The various software selectable options
are invoked by sending an ESCape code followed bv specific
byteta) to the printer. Underlining can be turned on or off at
will. The printer can be instructed to set the left margin of
the print area, and alsa the riqht margin, forcing the type ta

These can all be accessed by using the appropriate ESC code,

As Io am sure ia obvious, [ am very pleased with the
printer. Tt costs anoroax &pound;4 pius VAT. and the Gk serial
butter costs approx &pound;1LSS. A rall paper halder is stranaly
Sormmericleecl&nbsp;, and tractor feed would be necessary for label oar
narrow form handling. Its speed of 164 cps is very impressive.
though it does slow down for twiddly bits. I Suqqest that many
of ibs users will opt to drive it at 9604 or 19.2bk baud. I look
forward to many years of service fram it, when I have finished
customisina my text editor to allow for the differing spacings
and type densities. This is being written on a quickly cabbled
up set of patches to an existing text editor, but the printer
demands better than that!
