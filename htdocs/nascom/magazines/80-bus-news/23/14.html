RENUM
This is an extremely handy command and allows program lines to be spread
</p>
<p>
or packed, particularly after editing; new lines can be inserted between existing
lines. To use RENUM, type:
</p>
<p>
renum [&lt;A&gt;[&lt;B&gt;[,&lt;m&gt;]]]
where A is the new line number of the first line to be renumbered, B, the line
</p>
<p>
number, numbers below which will NOT be renumbered. I is the increment. Default
values for A and I are 10, and if B is omitted, the whole program will be
renumbered in sequence. For example:
RENUM &ndash; renumbers the whole program in increments of 10, starting with line 10.
RENUM 150,,20 &ndash; renumbers the whole program which will then start at 150 and line
numbers will be incremented by 20.
RENUM 1000,100,50 &ndash; renumbers lines from 100 so that they start at 1000,
incrementing by 50.
</p>
<p>
Note that RENUM alters correctly all line numbers appearing after a GOTO,
GOSUB, IF....THEN, ON....GOTO or ON....GOSUB. RENUM cannot be used to change the
order of program lines nor can it (in common with AUTO) create line numbers
greater than 65529; an error message will result!

REM:
Apart from the normal use of &lsquo;REM&rsquo; after the line number for program
</p>
<p>
comments, it is possible to use a single quote (&rsquo;) which may be placed anywhere
on the line, after the line number. Everything on the same line which follows the
&ldquo;&rsquo; " Will be ignored; this can be particularly useful for detailed comments &ndash;
for example:
</p>
<p>
400 FOR I=1 TO 255 &lsquo;GO THROUGH THE ASCII CHARACTER SET
</p>
<p>
110 PRINT I,CHR$(I) &lsquo;PRINT THE APPROPRIATE CHARACTER ON THE SCREEN
</p>
<p>
420 FOR T=1 TO 500 &lsquo;WAIT A BIT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE IT
</p>
<p>
130 NEXT T
</p>
<p>
140 NEXT I &lsquo;GO ROUND AGAIN! (AND AGAIN!)
</p>
<p>
EDIT:
</p>
<p>
The EDIT command in MBASIC is quite sophisticated and only a few of its
features will be covered here. Editing can be carried out both while the program
is being typed in and on the finished program. Single characters can be changed
either by typing &lt;backspace&gt; or &lt;delete&gt;. In the latter case, the deleted letter
is enclosed by backslashes (\) and a carriage return occurs if there are no
preceding characters. In this version of MBASIC, the typing of &lt;*A&gt; instead of
the &lt;cr&gt; at the end of the line puts you into EDIT mode and allows the use of
almost all the features of the EDIT command. If, having typed a &lt;cr&gt; you wish to
edit the line just typed, use &lsquo;EDIT&nbsp;.&rsquo; &ndash; the full-stop indicates to the EDIT
command that the current line is to be edited.
</p>
<p>
EDIT Commands:
</p>
<p>
T Inserts new characters into the line which is being edited (to a maximum
of 255 characters including the original text). Insertion is stopped by typing
&lt;ese&gt; or &lt;altmode&gt;, depending on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>
&lt;del&gt; The delete key typed during an Insert command will delete the character
to the left of the cursor.
</p>
<p>
&lt;er&gt; If a carriage return is typed during an Insert command, the effect is to
terminate the Insertion and print the rest of the line; the edited version will
then replace the original.
</p>
<p>
x The action of the X command is similar to the I command, but it causes
the printing of all characters to the right of the cursor, then it enters the &lsquo;IT&rsquo;
mode. This is a useful facility when new statements are to be added to the end of
an existing line (but don&rsquo;t forget the colon which is used as a statement
separator).
</p>
<p>
H The H command has a similar action to the X command but it deletes,
rather than prints all characters to the right of the cursor, before entering the
I mode.
