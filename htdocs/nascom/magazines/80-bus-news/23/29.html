Temporary string pointer.<br>
This contains a pointer into the temporary string pool.

<tr><td><p>TMSTPL</p></td><td><p>10B3</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
Temporary string pool.<br>
This is a store of 4 temporary strings that were created by
such things as &ldquo;LEFTS&rdquo;,&ldquo;CHRS&rdquo; and string concatenation.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>TMPSTR</p></td><td><p>10BF</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
Temporary string.<br>
This string block for the current string being constructed.
All string blocks are four bytes long. The first byte gives
the length of the string. The second byte is not used and the
third and fourth bytes form the address in memory where the
string itself can be found.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>STRBOT</p></td><td><p>10C3</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
Bottom of string space.<br>
This contains a pointer to the bottom of the string area that
is currently being used. Each time a new string is defined it
is moved into the string area below this pointer and the
pointer is adjusted to point to the new bottom of string area.
If there is not enough room for the new string then a
&ldquo;garbage collection&rdquo; is performed to remove all unused strings.
If there still is not enough room then an &ldquo;?OS Error&rdquo; occurs.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>CUROPR</p></td><td><p>10C5</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
Current operator address.<br>
This contains the address of the current operator in EVAL
so that the registers may hold other values without using the
stack which is being used to hold sub-expressions.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>LOOPST</p></td><td><p>10C7</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
Loop start address.<br>
This contains the address of first statement in the FOR loop
which is being constructed. This address is later moved into
the FOR block on the stack.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>DATLIN</p></td><td><p>10C9</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
DATA statement line number.<br>
This contains the line number of the current position of the
DATA statement pointer. It is used by DATSNR to tell the user
in which line the bad DATA occurred.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>FORFLG</p></td><td><p>10CB</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
FOR / FN / array flag.<br>
This contains a flag as to what GETVAR must find.<br>
A value of 00H means find a variable or array element.<br>
A value or 01H means find an array name.<br>
A value of 64H means find a variable only.<br>
A value of 80H means find an FN function.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>LSTBIN</p></td><td><p>10CC</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
This flag is set when ever any input is made into BUFFER.<br>
RETURN first tests to see if the GOSUB was a direct statement
and if so checks this flag, if this flag is set then an INPUT
statement has occurred within the subroutine and so as far as
RETURN is concerned, BUFFER now contains garbage so it jumps
back to command mode.
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>READFG</p></td><td><p>10CD</p></td><td colspan=2><p>
READ / INPUT flag.<br>
This contains a flag to tell the READ/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>INPUT routine if it is
processing a DATA statement or data for an INPUT statement.
If this value is zero then INPUT is active else READ is.
