I could hardly believe it when I was asked for another contribution so quickly.
What could I find to write about so soon after my last load of rubbish? Well, I
suppose a reasonable start would be talk about things that have NOT arrived.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Where are they now?</u>
</h3>
<p>
For example, the Sinclair Microdrive! Yes, it&rsquo;s only 15 months(ish) since it was
first announced, and I only mention it here because I know of one certain
individual who intends to try and interface one to their 80-BUS machine. Could
be interesting, and somewhat cheaper than a Winchester. Which reminds me! (Note
the subtle way of changing topic &ndash; very clever!) In a long, long lost price list
from Nascom (or should that be Lucas Logic, or even Lucas/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom? &ndash; I get
confused so easily) I seem to remember a line that said something like &ldquo;5MB
Winchester Disk Drive &ndash; price to be advised&rdquo;, and at about the same time there
was a Nas-Net leaflet with &ldquo;optional hard disk&rdquo; mentioned &ndash; where has that got
to? And how about Gemini, their last catalogue mentioned
&ldquo;<?php externalLink("GM818"); ?>
Serial Board&rdquo; &ndash;
no sign of it yet. And nor is there any sign of IO Research&rsquo;s
<?php externalLink("Mini Palette","Pluto Pallette",""); ?>,
Frame Grabber or IO-Net boards. What are these people all so busy doing that
they can&rsquo;t produce these almost forgotten (but not by me!) &lsquo;products&rsquo;?
</p>
<h3>
<u>What are they doing instead?</u>
</h3>
<p>
Lucas must be putting all their current effort into the Lucas LX range. What is
that? Well, remember the &lsquo;Conspiracy&rsquo; that I mentioned two issues ago &ndash; that&rsquo;s
to do with the LX. The original idea was to take a Quantum 2000 case and put a
Nascom&nbsp;2,
<?php externalLink("AVC","",""); ?>, MAP RAM board and Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
FDC/SASI board inside it. It was
first shown at Which? in January, but I don&rsquo;t think that it has been sighted
since. Interesting developments afoot?
</p>
<p>
And Gemini? Well they have launched one or two new things in recent months.
There is the
<?php externalLink("GM839"); ?>
prototyping board at &pound;12.50. Made of fibre-glass, and laid
out for high density packing, it&rsquo;s ideal for that washing machine and central
heating controller! Then there&rsquo;s their
<?php externalLink("GM833"); ?>
RAM-DISK board. (It seems they
managed to resist the temptation to call it a Virtual Disk board, because of the
possible abbreviation of the latter!) This board provides 512K bytes of RAM,
port-mapped in such a way as to allow very easy interface software, using the
otherwise little-used Z80 INIR and OTIR instructions. Apparently a DIL switch on
board allows upto 8 Megabytes of the things. Fancy a dose? Then there&rsquo;s the
Gemini Multi-Net (briefly described last issue) and a permutation on the Galaxy
called &ldquo;M-F-B&rdquo;. And what does that stand for? Multi-Format-BIOS of course. A
Galaxy is supplied, fitted with (or surrounded by) drives of different TPI
(tracks per inch), an optional Winchester, and an optional 8&Prime; drive. M-F-B links
it all together, and allows easy transfer of software between almost all
soft-sectored 5.25&Prime; and 8&Prime; formats. &ldquo;Superbrain to Xerox? &ndash; No problem. IBM to
Osborne? &ndash; One moment sir.&rdquo; They are obviously looking at Software houses as
their market for the M-F-B, and I am sure that there is little point in printing
a price here. (Actually, I don&rsquo;t know it, but I don&rsquo;t want to admit to that.)
</p>
<p>
And finally, IO Research. Well, to be quite honest I have heard very little
about what they are upto. I understand that sales of
<?php externalLink("Pluto","PLUTO"); ?>
are pretty good,
mainly to non-80-BUS computer owners, who also have to buy special interfaces.
Why don&rsquo;t these people buy a REAL microcomputer, which this board would plug
straight into? Some people have no idea!
