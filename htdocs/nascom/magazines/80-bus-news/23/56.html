Both compilers provide a way to include machine code routines in erograms, and
call. them. This means that they both adwit that carefully written machine code
Hoes even faster than their standard run time routinesr I suerose. There is no
shame in that. Still&raquo; given the rrogram seeed that either compiler dives YOU s
saghine code routines are only rarely &ndash; necessary, when vou are using the
computer to control some tricky &lsquo;Peripheral, for example.
</p>
<p>
Both compilers have random number routinesr but the Hisoft one is primitives as
it just returns the contents of the Z8Q refresh resister, which often causes
Programs that use it to be far less random than the programmer wanted them toa
be. Compas has a function &ldquo;random( id&rdquo; which returns an inteser roiin the range
Oeriezi. This is verv useful in: dame erogramming!
</p>
<p>
Another of the things Pascal could have dene with is a little extension to the
CASE statement, so that vou could specify what was to hareen if the controlling
variable didn&rsquo;t match any of the items in the CASE statement. Surrrise! Compas
has OTHERS, and Hisoft has ELSE. These mean the same as each other!&mdash;

Standard Pascal only knows about seauential files, Compras has random a&amp;cess
files toc. Hisoft have been eramising to add theses but have not vet dene its
or have forsetten ta send me the new version!
</p>
<p>
In the event that you manage to write a Program &ldquo;that is tos bid for vour
machiner what can you de? If you have Compas, vou can chain prodrams,&raquo; which is
handy. You can dae it with Hiseft rrograms as welly IF vou know enough about
using CP/M.

<p>
Selling vour programs.
</p>
<p>
If vou write it with Compass vou are forced by the licence vou have signed te
pay Polyvdata aio rercentase of the money vou set far vour Program. This is
supPosedly because the rerosram will centain FPolyvdata&rsquo;s run time routines. In
facts they would be -of no use to the buver on their owny with no way of knowing
how to call them. Peorle who sell software with cenditions like this attached
should be forced to sav so in their advertising. Given the erice of Compas, T
think they ought to be harpey with what they haver and not try to make even more
money from the work of others. Hiseft do NOT demand money in this wav.

The suitability or otherwise of either of the compilers for your PurFoses will
depend very much on what those rureoses are. If vou want to write large suites
of business prosirams, and do it without having te write youtown routines to dao
fancy screen handlings string handling and high precisien calculations for yous
then it will have to be Compas. You will also have all the betHer of raving
them asain if vou sell vour work. If. on the other hands vou want to learn
Pascal, and write amazing games: fast contre] programs and generally stay close
to &ldquo;Proper&rdquo; Pascal&raquo; then ao for Hisoeft. Thens when you sell 104,409 cories of
vour dame to all the Srectrum owners Cves, Hisoft Pascal 4 is available far the
SPectrum, so you can write dames/ete for a huge market!i] you can keer all the
Moneys until the tax man finds out. My own preference? Frankly, it is the
Hiseft Products and I am looking forward toa the dav they bring out Modula 2!
