THE EB FSOoOMn FXO FRINTeER.

<p>
A review by Rory O&rsquo;Farrell
tf there is a standard printer in the microcomputer
</p>
<p>
world, it is probably the EPSON Mxo@. While considering the
purchase of one of these, I learned af the imminent arrival of
a new model, the FXG@. Its preliminary specification and the
repubation of EPSON decided me to wait a few weeks and get ane
of these. &amp; la David Hunt in INMC No. 7, I prapose to review
this printer, using it to print out its own review, which will
be sent to the Editar ag camera-ready copy. This will @xplain
any departure fram &ldquo;the high standard of typesetting in the
BARBUS News.

<p>
The FREE is approx i ime twice the size of the IF,
Measur LG ae L4"d AS shandard, it comes with a

provided by the buffer manufacturers. Heinq desiaqned for the
Mk, the buffer was a tight squeeze, as a 40 way umbilical
cheated it of about @fa.&rdquo;. Evy loosening the adjoining board,
enough roan was created. The buffer board is selectable tor the
usual parity and atop bit operons. These selections are made by
sliding little (supplied: caonmmectars down antoa prepositioned
lines of contacts. These are known as Berg connectors. Ne
soldering is required. This complete, it only remained to set

<p>
the power-on options of the FRE@ and the Microbutfer, then

refit the lid. A little panel over the Centronics connector
