If there is a standard printer in the microcomputer
world, it is probably the EPSON MX80. While considering the
purchase of one of these, I learned of the imminent arrival of
a new model, the FX80. Its preliminary specification and the
reputation of EPSON decided me to wait a few weeks and get one
of these. &agrave; la David Hunt in INMC No. 7, I propose to review
this printer, using it to print out its own review, which will
be sent to the Editor as camera-ready copy. This will explain
any departure from the high standard of typesetting in the
80BUS News.

The FX80 is approx twice the size of the IMP,
measuring 17&Prime;w x 14&Prime;d x 4&Prime;h. As standard, it comes with a
Centronics interface, but optional interface boards are readily
available to give RS232 and IEEE 488; these may also provide
bigger buffers. I purchased my printer with an RS232 8k buffer.
The printer was delivered in a sturdy card carrying box, with
foam inserts. To insert the 8k RS232 interface buffer, it was
necessary to open the case by removing four Phillips-type
screws. The 8k buffer plugged into a prefitted socket within,
sitting on four plastic supports, for which screws were
provided by the buffer manufacturers. Beinq designed for the
MX80, the buffer was a tight squeeze, as a 40 way umbilical
cheated it of about 1/16&Prime;. By loosening the adjoining board,
enough room was created. The buffer board is selectable for the
usual parity and and stop bit options. These selections are made by
sliding little (supplied) connectors down onto prepositioned
lines of contacts. These are known as Berg connectors. No
soldering is required. This complete, it only remained to set
the power-on options of the FX80 and the Microbuffer, then
refit the lid. A little panel over the Centronics connector
removes to allow access to the DB25 connector for the RS232
interface. The options I set as follows:
