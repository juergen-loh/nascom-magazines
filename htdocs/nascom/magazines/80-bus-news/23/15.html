D Characters may be deleted by the use of this command. nD deletes n
characters to the right of the cursor where n is an integer in the range 0 to 255
(O defaults to 1 and if n is omitted, a default of 1 character is assumed). The
deleted character(s) are enclosed in backslashes and the cursor will be
positioned just to the right of the last character which has been deleted.
</p>
<p>
5 Searching for a character is carried out by this command which has the
general form nSx where n is the nth occurrence of the character &lsquo;x&rsquo;. The default
value for nis 1 and the search begins with the second character to the right of
the cursor. All characters passed over by the cursor in its search are printed
and if the sought-for character is not found, the cursor will stop at the end of
the line; if the search was successful, the cursor will print the character and
stop to its right.
</p>
<p>
K This has a similar function to the 5 command but instead of printing all
characters as it passes over them, the command deletes them. The command has the
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;
</p>
<p>
general form nKx where n is the nth occurrence of character &lsquo;x&rsquo;; a default of 1
</p>
<p>
is assumed.
C The C command is used for character replacement in a line. It has the
</p>
<p>
general form Cx and changes the character on the right of the cursor to the
character &lsquo;x&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
iE The E command terminates editing and outputs a carriage return; unlike
the &lt;cr&gt; command, the remainder of the line is not printed.
</p>
<p>
Q Typing of Q restores the original line and control is passed to command
level.
</p>
<p>
L If the L command is used, the remainder of the line is printed&nbsp;, a &lt;crm
</p>
<p>
is output and then the line number is printed; editing is restarted at the
beginning of the line.
</p>
<p>
NOTE &ndash; If, during the running of a program, a SYNTAX ERROR is found, MBASIC will
automatically enter the EDIT mode, printing the message &lsquo;Syntax error in nn&rsquo;,
followed by the line number of the offending line. Editing can then start.
</p>
<p>
The best way to find out how the Editor works is to practice before you
write your Pan-galactic Black Hole Simulation program. (Ra. &ndash; This is all
superfluous if you use the Gemini on screen edit mode or Richards&rsquo; SYS, although
under nese circumstances the line length must not exceed the width of the
screen.

<p>
SYSTEM: .
The SYSTEM command exits from MBASIC and returns to the disk operating
</p>
<p>
systen.

<p>
LOAD:
The LOAD command has the format &lsquo;LOAD &ldquo;&lt;filename&gt;&rdquo;&rsquo; and locates and loads
</p>
<p>
the file into memory ready for use. On completion of a successful load, the &lsquo;Ok&rsquo;
prompt is given. The first double quote (") is mandatory but the second can be
omitted. [ md. &ndash; For drive selection see the note under SAVE.
</p>
<p>
SAVE:
</p>
<p>
The SAVE command is used, as its name suggests, to save a program from
memory to disk. It has the following format:
SAVE &ldquo;&lt;filename&gt;",[&lt;disk drive no-&gt; |
The effect of the SAVE command is to leave the current version of the program in
the computer&rsquo;s RAM and to copy an exact replica to disk where it is stored under
the &lt;filename&gt;. A frequent cause of program losses is when one inadvertently uses
a previously used filename (of a different program) as the &lt;filename&gt;. In this
case, the previous program is deleted from disk and replaced with a copy of the
current program under the old name &ndash; which can be frustrating! The moral is to
remember your filenames or to backup your program disks. SAVEing an ASCII file is
done by specifying the disk no. (usually 0 or 1), followed by an A &ndash; for example,
SAVE &ldquo;TEXT.BAS",O,A saves THEXT.BAS as an ASCII file on drive 0. ASCII files are
larger than the normally saved files and are both slower to load and more
extravagant of disk space; their chief advantage is that they can be used as
direct input to other programs if required.
