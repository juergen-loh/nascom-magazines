FEATURES:
</p>
<p>
EFFECTIVELY REPLACES EPROMS
</p>
<p>
Does away with the inconvenience of EPROM programming
</p>
<p>
and the compromise of assigning valuable address space
</p>
<p>
to RON.
</p>
<p>
ON BOARD RE-CHARGEABLE Ni-Cad BATTERY
</p>
<p>
RETAINS MEMORY FOR OVER 1000 Hrs.
</p>
<p>
Battery is automatically charged during power-up periods.
</p>
<p>
HIGH SPEED OPERATION up to 6 MHz WITHOUT WAIT-STATES.
</p>
<p>
FULLY NASBUS! and GEMINI-80 BUS? COMPATIBLE.
</p>
<p>
PAGE MODE SCHEME SUPPORTED
</p>
<p>
The board can be configured to provide one 32k byte page or
</p>
<p>
two completely independent 16k byte pages.
</p>
<p>
Complete pages of 64k bytes are simply implemented by adding
</p>
<p>
more boards on to the bus.
</p>
<p>
SOFTWARE and/or HARDWARE READ/WRITE
</p>
<p>
PROTECTION.
</p>
<p>
4K blocks in either page are link selectable to be aligned on any
</p>
<p>
4K boundary.
</p>
<p>
FULLY BUFFERED ADDRESS, DATA AND CONTROL
</p>
<p>
SIGNALS.
</p>
<p>
MEMORY I.C. SOCKETS ARE LINK SELECTABLE TO
</p>
<p>
SUPPORT ANY 24 PIN 2k byte MEMORY L.C.s.
</p>
<p>
Thus the board can support up to 32k bytes of any mixture of
</p>
<p>
cmos, nmos rams or 2716/2516 eproms.
</p>
<p>
All options are link selectable using wire links plugged into
</p>
<p>
gold-plated socket pins, avoiding the risk of damage and the
</p>
<p>
inconvenience caused by soldering links directly to the board.
</p>
<p>
The printed circuit board is manufactured to the high quality
</p>
<p>
demanded by industrial users and conforms to B.S.9000.
</p>
<p>
The board comes assembled and tested and is supplied with a
I
</p>
<p>
minimum of 2k bytes of low-power cmos ram. Fully
documented.

&ldquo;Aspirins are not the only solution
</p>
<p>
to your backplane problems&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
BP14C BACKPLANE
</p>
<p>
14 SLOT 80-BUS &amp; NASBUS
TERMINATED BACKPLANE
</p>
<p>
BP14C has been designed, using mainframe techniques,
to solve microcomputer problems. As the speed of
microcomputers increases, the demands on the bussing
system become more and more critical. Without the
use of a properly terminated backplane, system
performance and reliability will inevitably suffer.
</p>
<p>
BP14C has been designed to overcome the three major
backplane problems:
</p>
<p>
1. Noise generated
</p>
<p>
2. Noise generated
</p>
<p>
3. Noise generated
</p>
<p>
backplane power
</p>
<p>
by reflected signals.
by crosstalk.
</p>
<p>
and transmitted through
rails.
</p>
<p>
These problems have been attacked on the BP14C by:
</p>
<p>
1. Terminating ALL active bus signals into a
potential balanced R.C. filter.
</p>
<p>
2. Interlacing all active bus signals with
ground &lsquo;shield&rsquo; tracks.
</p>
<p>
3. Forming a complete ground plane on one side
of the backplane and using very wide tracks
for the other power rails.
</p>
<p>
The Backplane measures 14" by 8" and supports up to
14 slots. Smaller lengths can be obtained by a
simple &lsquo;score and break&rsquo; operation.
</p>
<p>
The backplane will fit neatly into a 19" rack with
spare space available for a Power Supply Unic.
</p>
<p>
The backplane features proper implementation of
both the interupt and the bus request daisy chains.
</p>
<p>
BPi4C is another product designed in line with
Microcode (Control) Limited&rsquo;s commitment to
industrial quality 80-bus and NASBUS performance.
