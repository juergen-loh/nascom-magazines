Taking the serial case first. On a Nascom there is no input provided for the
DTR signal to be received by the computer. However, there are one or two spare inputs
available on the keyboard port (one or two depending upon whether the machine is a
Nascom&nbsp;2 or a Nascom&nbsp;1). By long standing convention with Nascoms, bit 7 of the
keyboard port is used for this purpose. On a Nascom&nbsp;2 this is conveniently returned to
test point 3 whilst on a Nascom&nbsp;1 this is available on the keyboard plug. Note that
this input is at TTL levels, that is the signal applied to this pin must be between +5
and 0 volts. Also note that this input is not &lsquo;pulled up&rsquo; to +5 volts on the Nascom&nbsp;1,
and only &lsquo;pulled up&lsquo; on the Nascom&nbsp;2 by a 10K resistor which is located for some
improbable reason on the keyboard. This lack of &lsquo;pull up&rsquo; on the keyboard input tends
towards atrocious noise immunity and in either case the inclusion of a 470R resistor
mounted on the back of the pcb, connected between the input pin and some nearby +5
volt point is a good idea.

Now with some printers the DTR signal is provided at TTL levels and this may
be connected directly to bit 7 of the Nascom keyboard port. More typically the DTR
signal swings between +12 and &ndash;12 volts, this being the standard voltages employed by
the RS232 protocol. Direct connection of this signal to a TTL input will lead to the
instant death of the input latch and possibly other damage. Some method of limiting or
converting the +12/-12 volt signal to an acceptable +5/0 volt swing must be used. The
ideal answer is a 4.7 volt zener diode with the cathode (the end with the coloured
band) connected to the input pin, and the anode connected to the 0 volt rail. As the
zener is reverse biased when the +12 volt signal is applied, it will conduct and limit
the incoming voltage to +4.7 volts. When a &ndash;12 volt signal is applied the diode it is
forward biased and the voltage will be limited to about &ndash;0.6 volts. Entirely suitable
for the TTL input. Unfortunately, the zener diode can not be connected directly across
the incoming DTR line, as, if the sending device, the printer, is capable of supplying
any amount of current the conduction of the diode would allow a considerable current
to pass, damaging either the diode or the printer or both. A series limiting resistor
of 150R provides the answer. This should be connected in series with the incoming DTR
line. The complete circuit is shown below:

On the Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM811"); ?>
and
<?php externalLink("GM813"); ?>
boards connection for the DTR signal is provided
in the for of the Clear To Send (CTS) input. This is another line in the RS232
protocol and is the complement of the DTR output. By connecting the two, the DTR
output from the printer indicates to the CTS input on the computer that all is ready
and data transmission can commence. On the Gemini cards there is no need to convert
the DTR signal to TTL levels as the CTS input on the Gemini is fully RS232 compatible.
The CTS input is also TTL compatible, although noise immunity may be improved by
changing the values of resistors on the main board. The details in the technical
manuals are adequate, so refer to them if the DTR signal is at TTL levels.

When considering the RS232 protocols what has been previously described is
somewhat simplified, and RS232 has other signals which may or may not play a part in
the handshaking process. Some printers, usually those with keyboards and designed for
two way communication may require additional signals to enable; them to print. My old
Texas Instruments 745 and the Teletype 43 are two such printers. The additional
