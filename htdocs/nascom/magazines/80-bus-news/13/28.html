Handling the printer was the next problem, characters are output at 9600 baud,
which is a lot faster than the printer can print them. The printer has a 1K buffer,
but this is soon filled. Fortunately the printer is equipped with a handshake signal
which may be connected to pin 2 of SK2, signalling when the buffer is full, or the
printer is out of paper, etc. A simple piece of software supervises the printer.
Before sending a character the following code is called:
</p>
<p>
PUSH AF 3; Save the flags and the A register
</p>
<p>
?
BUSY IN A,(0) ; Get the input into the A register
RLA 3; Move the bit to be tested into the C flag
JR C, BUSY 3; Test and loop if busy
POP AF
</p>
<p>
After which the software may direct the character to be sent to the printer.

hope the above will be of help to someone, and that it will solve some of their
problems.
