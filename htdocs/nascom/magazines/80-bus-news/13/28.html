Handling the printer was the next problem, characters are output at 9600&nbsp;baud,
which is a lot faster than the printer can print them. The printer has a 1K buffer,
but this is soon filled. Fortunately the printer is equipped with a handshake signal
which may be connected to pin 2 of SK2, signalling when the buffer is full, or the
printer is out of paper, etc. A simple piece of software supervises the printer.
Before sending a character the following code is called:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
        PUSH AF 3         ; Save the flags and the A register
BUSY    IN A,(0)          ; Get the input into the A register
        RLA 3             ; Move the bit to be tested into the C flag
        JR C, BUSY 3      ; Test and loop if busy
        POP AF
</pre>
<p class="continued">
After which the software may direct the character to be sent to the printer.

This finishes my summary of the major changes I have made to my Nascom&nbsp;1, I
hope the above will be of help to someone, and that it will solve some of their
problems.
