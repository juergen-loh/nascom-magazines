REAL TINE CLOCK FOR NASCOM
</p>
<p>
Bring a new disension to your Nascom,
This teal time clock runs independently of the
Nascom CPU thus vastly reducing real time
activities.
Accurate timekeeping is maintained by battery backup

Plugs into Nascom P.1.0.
A wajor feature of the unit is its ability to
provide a contirwally updating display of the tine
on the Nascom screen. This facility utilises
interrupts (NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 only}, thus allowing rornal
software to be used at the same tine as the clock.
This reqires no sodifications to existing
software,
A relocatable interrupt routine is supplied complete
with software to allow the clock to be read from any
