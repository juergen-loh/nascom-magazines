mistakes learnt in correcting the mistakes from the original program and so on. The
ultimate learning machine cannot be programmed, as no programmer exists with the
answers to all things, therefore the ultimate computer can not be built. No machine,
no matter how intelligent, can be more intelligent that the man who programs it. All
this is within the bounds of philosphical thought and current technology. So it seems
that we are safe for a while yet from the computer that thinks it is God.

On the other hand, things in nature are always changing. As man&rsquo;s knowledge
expands and his comprehension of things around him grows, who is to say that
philosophies will not change. A way may be found to enable to machine to preprogram
itself from the environmental factors which surround it. It may be able to pass it&rsquo;s
intelligence from one machine to the next learning as it goes. It would probably take
on some form of locomotion and have sensory and manipulative capability. When that day
comes, the machine will probably have evolved into to bipedal structure for
locomotion, have two arms terminating in hands with fingers for manipulation, a large
single central processor in a safe place on top of the body structure. In fact the
computer would probably be indestinguishable from the person who programs a computer
today. You think that is far fetched&nbsp;? I only hope I shall not be around when (not if)
such a machine is built.

What has this to do with the computer and the outside world&nbsp;? Not a lot
really, it is simply an extension of the ways in which the micro is already affecting
our lives. The vision of the mythical microprocessor controlled washing machine always
springs in to view at this point. Well it now exists. What about processor controlled
radios, televisions, video tape recorders, cameras, etc. These are here, and the micro
is already finding it&rsquo;s way into more computer oriented equipment; printers with
intelligence, dedicated disk controllers, intelligent keyboards and the like. In fact
the medium sized micro these days does not contain a single microprocessor (although
the one that does the number crunching will always be thought of as THE micro), no the
medium sized micro computer already contains four or five dedicated microprocessors
subserviant to the THE MAIN MICRO. What about the way these communicate. As a simple
example I intend to discuss printer interfaces, and the whole theme of this article
came about in a strange way, mainly from my feeling rather piqued by an insignificant
action on the part of my favourite micro company.

A couple of days ago I reread the Nascom &lsquo;Dealer and OEM Technical Newsletter
No. 3&rsquo;, paying attention instead of glancing through. Now this irregular newsletter is
published by Lucas at Warwick and I attribute most of it to the pen of Mike Hessey,
Nascom&rsquo;s Engineering Manager, a very capable engineer, ardent Nascom fan, and
generally nice person to know (stop blushing Mike). The Nascom newsletter is
distributed free to Nascom dealers and contains a stack of useful information although
to date it has been unnecessary to draw attention to it as a fair chunck of what has
been published so far has already appeared in the pages of the Program Power magazine,
INMC, INMC-80 and this rag, albeit uncredited and now covered by a lucas copyright.
Which brings me to the point.

Part of the Nascom Applications Note AN-0006 caught my eye as being somewhat
familiar, this concerns the software for driving parallel printers and would appear to
be a re-write of the Centronics driving routines I sent Nascom, gratis, shortly after
Lucas took over Nascom. Now I agree that the software driving routines published in
the Nascom newsletter could have been arrived at independantly, as there are only a
couple of ways of sensibly driving a parallel printer with the Nascom hardware after
all, but I somehow doubt it. It&rsquo;s not the fact that they have published the software I
object to, after all I wrote it to help other people, and I&rsquo;m glad to know that it was
considered adequate for general publication amongst Nascom dealers. No, it&rsquo;s the fact
that it&rsquo;s not credited and now covered by a Lucas copyright I object to. You may have
noticed that when I crib routines from other people that I always credit the source I
pinched it from, after all, it&rsquo;s the polite thing to do. Once I wondered why Richard
Beal put a copyright notice in the NAS-SYS source when he had declared it public
domain software anyway, so I asked him, and he told me it was so that he could retain
