<u class="double">The Arfon light pen (If you can still get it)</u>
</h2>
<p>
The Arfon light pen is housed in a black anodised aluminium cylinder about 18cm
long and 2cm in diameter. It&rsquo;s not heavy, weighing in at about 2.5 Ounces (my
wife&rsquo;s scales aren&rsquo;t metric!), and is supplied with about 130cms of lead
terminated in a 5-pin DIN plug. This DIN plug will plug directly into the Gemini

card. I believe there is an interface available for a Nascom, but I have
not seen this and cannot comment on it. There is a push button mounted in the pen
body close to the end that carries the photo-diode. This push button falls
conveniently under the fore-finger when the pen is held in a &lsquo;pen-like&rsquo; manner.
</p>
<p>
The output of the photo-diode is amplified and limited to produce a TTL compatible
STROBE signal. The switch is debounced and produces a TTL compatible ENABLE signal.
</p>
<h2>
<u class="double">Using the light pen</u>
</h2>
<p>
I have used the light pen in conjunction with the Gemini IVC and shall thus
restrict my discussions to this particular combination.
</p>
<p>
The 6845 CRT controller used on the IVC directly supports a light pen. The STROBE
output of the light pen is connected through to the LPEN input on the 6845. As
supplied the light pen provides a negative going strobe pulse. The CRI controller
uses the rising edge of this strobe as a trigger for latching the screen address,
and so all coordinates returned will be found to be offset by the strobe pulse
width. Purists may like to dismantle the light pen and select the opposite polarity
for the strobe, but this is of little consequence as it can easily be catered for
in software. Note, however, that if the strobe is left as it is the offset required
will be dependent on the light pen used, and also on the screen width in use. (A
strobe width of 6us is 12 characters in the 80-wide mode, and nearly half that in
the 48-wide mode).
</p>
<h2>
<u class="double">The IVC software &ndash; ESC P</u>
</h2>
<p>
The video card supports the ESC P command for returning the coordinates of the
light pen. At the time the IVC software was written no light pen was available to
try with it, and so the function only performs the simple operations as follows:&ndash;
</p>
<table class="lightpen-ivc">
<tr><td>i)</td><td>Wait until the light pen switch is found to be operated.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ii)</td><td>Wait one TV frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>iii)</td><td>Read the light pen register in the CRT controller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>iv)</td><td>Adjust the address to account for IVC hardware delays.</td></tr>
<tr><td>v)</td><td>Test for a valid screen address.</td></tr>
<tr><td>vi)</td><td>If the address is not valid then go to i).</td></tr>
<tr><td>vii)</td><td>Convert the address to equivalent Row/Column coordinates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>viii)</td><td>Return the coordinates to the host system.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This performs the basic function required by a controlling program, but to get the
best out of it a little more support is required. This is illustrated in the
following sections using the ESC L and ESC U functions of the IVC. (See IVC
manual). One small point to take into account with the function is that if the
switch on the pen is held down the IVC will immediately return a set of
coordinates whenever the ESC P sequence is received. ie The function is level
sensitive, not edge triggered. The controlling software will have to decide if the
coordinate pair represent a new selection, or if the operator has still not yet
released the switch from his last selection. (See example 4 for a way round this).
