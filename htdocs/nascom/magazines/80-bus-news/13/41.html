further test to find out which bit was set as the AND instruction will have also
set the sign bit in the flag register to indicate the state of bit 7. Thus if it is
Positive (i.e. bit 7 was 0), then bit 0 must have been set to create the NZ result
of the AND.
</p>
<p>
Turning now to the execution timing of the code: It can be seen that even the
fastest loop is outside the time limit that has to met, so the code &ndash; simple as it
is &ndash; needs revising to make the loop tighter. Setting the mask byte of 81H in a
register and performing the AND with that register will save 3 T states, and making
the last JR a JP will save a further 2, but that only reduces the loop to 68 T
states, still 4 over the target. The &ldquo;Exit on IRQ&rdquo; JP in the middle of the code is
a bit of a time waster as it only serves to terminate the loop and contributes
nothing to the data transfer itself, and so could be moved with some benefit.
</p>
<p>
With some re-organisation the code could now look like this:
</p>
<?php imageInsertMgz("Image-41-1.png"); ?>
<p>
The re-organisation has effectively removed one JP from the critical loop (at the
expense of an extra JR at the start to get into the loop), and has improved the
timing figures as a result. Going straight through is now well under the 64 T-state
limit, but the extra 27 T-states that occur when there is a wait for the DRQ are
slightly worrying. A more detailed cosideration is required to see if they matter.
</p>
<p>
Assume that a DRQ has appeared towards the end of the execution of the IN
instruction that is checking the status port, and has just been missed. Now the
number of T states that occur until the data byte is actually read is:
4+<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>12+<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>11+<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>4+<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>7+<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>10+<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>11
= 59 &ndash; so that byte will be read before the controller assembles
the next byte (which comes after 64 T states). When the label LOOP is next reached
the DRQ bit will be set (because it has taken &gt;64 T-sates to get back there) so the
next data transfer loop will be a short one (56 T states) and some time will be
caught up. This will continue until the routine overshoots and has to wait again.
Anyway it all seems possible.
</p>
<p>
The code for a Write transfer is similar:&ndash;
</p>
<pre>
DRQ:    LD      A,(HL)
        OUT     (DATA),A
		.......
</pre>
<p>
So the time has come to code the routines up and to try them out.
Disaster! They don&rsquo;t work! Why not?
</p>
<p>
When all else fails read the data sheet. For those readers who like a challenge
read no further until you&rsquo;ve found the answer in the 1797 data sheet.....
