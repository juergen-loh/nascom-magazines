Having read E.P.T. Anderson&rsquo;s interesting article (INMC80-5) on installing
2K EPROMs on the Nascom&nbsp;2, I endeavoured to use the same technique to instal 6116
2K static RAMs but without success. Eventually I had to resort to the last option
of actually trying to understand the address decoding on the Nascom&nbsp;2 in order to
come up with an alternative solution to the problem.
</p>
<p>
I found that it was only necessary to increase the 1K bandwidth pulses from
the address Multiplexer IC46 (CS0 &ndash; CS7) to 2K and to connect pin 19 of the
linkblock to A10 on the address bus.
</p>
<p>
The resulting solution is simple and flexible and can also be used with
2716 EPROMs requiring no extra components and less wiring than the published
solution (without which I would not have attempted this).
</p>
<p class="noindent">
The modifications for 6116 Rams are:
</p>
<p class="noindent">
1. Wire up the link blocks as for 4118 static RAM except pin 19 which should be
connected to A10 available on the link block below the VRAM IC&nbsp;48 (I prefer to keep
all my wiring on the component side of the board).
</p>
<p class="noindent">
2. Lift out IC46 and bend out pins 3 and 13 to the horizontal position and
carefully solder wires from A12 &amp; A11 (available on the linkblock as above) to
these.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
3. Wire the appropriate decode pads as normal on LKS1. Note that since each block
is now 8K and not 4K then extra decode addresses will need to be connected to each
block e.g. to assign block A to addresses 1000-2FFF would require pins 5, 6, 13 and
14 to be mutually connected.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
4. Switches LSW1/7,8 both need to be down (Open)
</p>
<p class="noindent">
If 2716&rsquo;s are required then the Link block should be configured as in the diagram.

<h3>
Switching RAM/EPROM or EPROM/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>EPROM
</h3>
<p>
To do this it is necessary to pull pin 18 to +5 volts using a 1K resistor.
The appropriate chip pulse can then be switched to or from the relevant chip
without the chip enable causing spurious read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>writes to occur. If it is only
desired to select Block A instead of Block B or external memory /Block A or B, then
it is only necessary to switch the address decodes on LKS1 to the appropriate
RAM/ROM selects on pins 1 to 8 (or to open circuit).
</p>
<h3>
Warning!
</h3>
<p>
Note that &ldquo;even&rdquo; 4K blocks (e.g. 2000, 4000 etc.) will normally occur on
the lower 2 chips in each block, whereas odd 4K addresses will occur on the upper 2
chips i.e. it is not possible to select two odd addresses to the same block (e.g.
B000 &amp; D000). This should not be a problem. Note&nbsp;!!! Pin 9 on LKS1 is for
E000-FFFF, not E000-EFFF as claimed!
</p>
<h3>
4K RAMS and EPROMs
</h3>
<p>
It appears that the same technique could be applied for 4K chips, in which
case pins 3 &amp; 13 of IC46 would be connected to A13 &amp; A12.
