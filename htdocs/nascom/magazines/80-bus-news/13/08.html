is that you do end up with a machine readable version of the source code but if
anyone else follows this path I would strongly advise them to spend more time than
I did on identifying the DATA areas before dis-assembling!

<p>
For my particular purposes this is a better solution because, although
relocated, all parts of Nas-Sys are still in the same relationship to each other. I
am using a CP/M system to develop software that will then run on &lsquo;standard&rsquo;
NASCOMs, (without disk) which are used to drive other equipment and if I write the
software with all absolute references to parts of Nas-Sys (such as revised command
tables) of the form &ldquo;Location + Offset&rdquo;, I can initialize &ldquo;Offset&rdquo; to 0 or 100H and
produce two versions of the same program very easily. VRAM must be modified also,
of course.
</p>
<p>
For the Disk routines I use the &ldquo;F&rdquo; command to switch between tape and disk
and to set up the filenames. &ldquo;R&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;W&rdquo; then Read and Write from the designated
devices. &ldquo;D&rdquo; is used to Delete files from disk. One facility that would be nice
would be the ability to obtain a directory listing from within Nas-Sys. It galls me
to have to write the code myself when the &lsquo;built in&rsquo; CP/M commands are loitering in
the top of memory. Can anyone tell me whether it is possible to call the built-in
routines (DIR &amp; REN in particular) as subroutines?

NASPEN
</h4>
<p>
Following the advice given in Dr Dark&rsquo;s diary I have now converted my EPROM
Naspen to a RAM version. However, the end result irritated me and I have made two
other alterations that may be of interest to other readers.
</p>
<p>
Having the printer routines called via the Nas-Sys UOUT routine is a
necessary evil when the program is in ROM, but a RAM version can be easily modified
so that the printer is directly accessed when the P command is used.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
The required changes are:
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 70%">
<tr><td></td><td></td><th>Existing</th><td></td><td></td><th>Replace with</th></tr>
<tr><td>B859</td><td>DF</td><td>)</td><td></td><td>C3</td><td>JP ppqq</td></tr>
<tr><td>B85A</td><td>6E</td><td>)</td><td>SCAL UOUT</td><td>qq<br><br></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>B85B</td><td>C9</td><td></td><td>RET</td><td>pp</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">
where ppqq is the start address of a printer subroutine.
</p>
<p>
The next problem is that the N command (return to Nas-Sys) operates by
Executing from location 0000. Unfortunately that location is now the CP/M warm
start and so the command does not have the required effect. A simple call to MRET
doesn&rsquo;t work because Naspen has modified the Nas-Sys work space and the latter
looks silly with the Upper and Lower case convention reversed! I have added the
following code to the end of the program where the original authors have
conveniently left 5 spare bytes:
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 40%">
<tr><td>BFFB</td><td>CD</td><td>)</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BFFC</td><td>0D</td><td>)</td><td>CALL STMON</td></tr>
<tr><td>BFFD</td><td>00</td><td>)</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BFFE</td><td>DF</td><td>)</td><td>SCAL MRET</td></tr>
<tr><td>BFFF</td><td>5B</td><td>)</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">
(If you don&rsquo;t understand this you haven&rsquo;t read your Nas-Sys manual)
</p>
<p>
This new segment is called by modifying the execution address of the N
command in the Naspen command table as follows:
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 70%">
<colgroup><col><col style="width: 30%"><col><col><col></colgroup>
<tr><th colspan=2>Existing</th><th colspan=3>Replace with</th></tr>
<tr><td>B99A</td><td>00</td><td>FB</td><td>)</td><td>the start address of</td></tr>
<tr><td>B99B</td><td>00</td><td>BF</td><td>)</td><td>the new segment above</td></tr>
</table>
