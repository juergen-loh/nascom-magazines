I was interested in the article by J.R. Williams in Vol. 1 Iss. 1 using the
National Real-Time Clock (RTC) chip. I have been perusing this device for similar
reasons, and the following comments may be of interest.
</p>
<p>
The RTC requires a delay between chip select and the write pulse (NWDS) of
at least 310nS., and a write pulse width of 430nS minimum. Although Mr. Williams&rsquo;
design is working at 2 MHz on a Nascom&nbsp;1, it may not always because it does not
provide the chip select delay. This would be worse on a Nascom&nbsp;2 at 4 MHz.
</p>
<p>
I am not yet in a position to try the circuit shown below but I hope that
the idea behind the modification may assist someone. Basically, the circuit forces
one extra WAIT state, and creates a new NWDS at a later time than the Z80 WR. (The
Z80 hardware manual fig. 4.0-3 can be used to analyse the circuit timing.)

[Bd. &ndash; It looks like this is the year of the RTC! Not only is there the article in
80-BUS Iss. 1, plus the Gemini GM816 I/O board with RTC and Gemini GM822 PIO driven
RTC, but now I hear that there are two or three other manufacturers about to launch
their own versions of Real Time Clocks! ! |

This replaces the direct connection between WK and NWDS in the original diagram.
