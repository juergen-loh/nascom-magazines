Well, hello again, and what wonderful new products and rumours of new
products are there for me to tell you about this time? And will you believe
anything I say anyway?
</p>
<p>
It seems that new product lines never come in ones, always in quantity.
Nascom have recently been publicising there &lsquo;Nas-net&rsquo; network system, based on
Nasom&nbsp;3 slaves with a Nascom disk system running Nas-Dos as the master. But they
are not alone in the networking world. IO Research have started talking about an
intelligent add-on &lsquo;IO-Net&rsquo; board, and Gemini have let (only a little) info. out on
their &lsquo;Multi-Net&rsquo; system based on cased MultiBoard slaves and a Galaxy with hard
disk as the master. Nas-net is available, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve no dates on the
others. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned hard disks I also ought to add that Gemini Winchester
units (pre-production?) have been spotted (5.4&nbsp;MByte formatted &amp; &pound;1500-ish), and
also a &lsquo;Winchester &ndash; TBA&rsquo; line has appeared on Nascom&rsquo;s latest price list. Better
start saving!
</p>
<p>
Whilst on about Nascom&rsquo;s price list, I wonder if they are running a secret
competition to see who can find the most mistakes? There are some lovely entries,
like a &lsquo;UART 6402&rsquo; at &pound;5.75, but a &lsquo;6402 UART&rsquo; at &pound;6.50; an &lsquo;MK3881 PIO&rsquo; at &pound;7, but
a &lsquo;PIO MK3881&rsquo; at &pound;4 (&ldquo;It must be the way I tell &lsquo;em.&rdquo;); some &lsquo;C/O cassettes&rsquo;, and
some &lsquo;Bridge rectifiles&rsquo;! Interesting to also note quite a few price rises
including; Nascom&nbsp;3 &pound;549 (or &pound;599 &ndash; 64K), FDC card &pound;145, NAS-DOS &pound;60, CP/M &pound;125,
and oddly the only recently available
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
at &pound;185. Mind you there has also just
been a special reduced price offer on Nascom&rsquo;s disk drives, so I hope some of you
got in there quick.
</p>

Having just mentioned things going up, a little story now of something
going down. A company. Those of you who &lsquo;go back a very long way&rsquo; in micros (that
means about three years) will remember Kerr Borland, then marketing director of
Nascom. It was the Kerr Borland/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>John Marshall team that pushed the Nascom&nbsp;1, then
Nascom&nbsp;2 so forcibly and successfully onto the &lsquo;micro-ignorant&rsquo; market-place. Then,
unfortunately, and to most people extremely surprisingly, Nascom went into
receivership. Some months later (as most readers will know) JM started up Gemini
Microcomputers and KB started Arfon Microelectronics. Arfon&rsquo;s first products were a
speech board (for 80-BUS systems and other machines) and a light pen (compatible
with Gemini&rsquo;s
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>),
followed by a growing range of VIC20 peripherals. Now I hear,
for reasons not really known, that Arfon has gone into receivership. I understand
that the products will continue to be available from other companies, but as for
Kerr, I have no idea of his current or future activities.
</p>
<p>
Several miscellaneous comments have floated through to me from the dealers.
How about the story of the customer who enquired about the availability of a modem
for his Nascom? It seems that this guy wanted his computer to be able to phone up
TIM, the speaking clock, and then set up its Real Time Clock itself!<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>......<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>some
dealers are agreeing with claims that
&lsquo;<?php externalLink("Pluto","",""); ?>&rsquo;
is &lsquo;out-of-this-world&rsquo; as it would
appear that for all their efforts to get hold of then, they might as well
be<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>......<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>other dealers report Nascom&nbsp;2s being &lsquo;thrown away&rsquo; as users change to
Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM811","811s"); ?>
&amp;
<?php externalLink("GM813","813s"); ?>
&ndash; please throw them in my direction!!<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>......<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>one dealer wonders if
Interface Components Ltd&rsquo;s (initials ICL) recent name change to Amersham Computer
Centre (initials ACC) gives a warning about the level of support to be given in
future (think about this one)<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>.......<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>and finally there was the guy who was told that
one dealer&rsquo;s (No hints as to who, but their initials are HR) &lsquo;forthcoming&rsquo; EPROM
programmer was &lsquo;simply years ahead&rsquo;; his response was that if their past record was
anything to go by then that is precisely when it would be available!
