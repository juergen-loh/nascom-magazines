Changing all locations marked equal to each other for the same character is

Reading 80-BUS News <a href="../text/"></a>issue&nbsp;1 regarding changing over the &lsquo;line feed&rsquo; and
&lsquo;newline&rsquo; keys, I made an attempt to do this under software control, the following
being the result. N.B. EPROM blower is essential.
</p>
<p>
Change Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 location 05A8 to 89, 05AB to 0F, 0585 to 09 and 05B9 to 8E
and swap over the keytops for L.F. and Newline.
</p>
<p>
One problem, ESCape works OK in machine code routines, however to escape
from BASIC (usually shift and newline twice) requires shift L.F. followed by shift
newline. I cannot find the reason, I suspect something in the BASIC chip. Has
anyone the answer? [Ed. &ndash; Yep, the BASIC ROM does shortened keyboard scans directly
whilst RUNning programs, and is looking for the specific key depressions that
correspond with the original shift and newline key positions.]
</p>
<p>
While in the Nas-Sys EPROM why not change locations 03BC to 03C4 (Nas-Sys&nbsp;1
message) to your own, my own displays MIKES m/c, a very personal message. Location
0077, normally 5F, is the cursor blink character, changing to B6 will give you the
little man.
</p>
<p>
Going back to messages, I have a second EPROM with software for the IVC
from Gemini which I fitted at 0494 (load command for paper tapes). If you want a
longer message than the 8 available at 03BC then put a jump to 0494 from 03BC and
put your message from 0494. (The software at 0494 is my own and not from Gemini.)
</p>
<p>
Lastly, still in Nas-Sys, I changed location 07BE to 00B0 which gives me my
Bits and PCs toolkit by simply typing D on the keyboard and newline.

<u>MONITOR, Naspen &amp; Reset</u>
</h3>
<p>
As a relatively new convert to the 80-BUS and the associated products I
have a lot to learn and I am greatly indebted to your magazine and its two
predecessors for their assistance in my learning process. May I take this
opportunity of wishing the new title a long and successful publication run.
</p>
<p>
My learning curve has now extended far enough that I am in a position to
make some rather hesitant contributions to the store of knowledge that I have so
far drawn on so heavily.

<h4>
MONITOR.COM AGAIN
</h4>
<p>
I rather regret that I did not receive my back copies of <a href="../text/"></a>MICROPOWER, that
other magazine, including Chris Blackmore&rsquo;s article on MONITOR.COM until after I
had devised my own solution to the problem. However, your readers may be interested
in a different approach. I dis-assembled Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 using NAS-DIS, identified the
references to VRAM and the work space from the published listing, and then
re-compiled the resulting source code with a revised origin at 100H, VRAM set to
F800H and the work space unchanged at 0C00H. Locations 100 &ndash; 102H were changed to a
jump to new code at 900H &ndash; 0BFFH which writes appropriate jumps into the Restart
locations, adds support for an EPSON Printer and adds disk routines. One advantage
