HIGH SPEED CASSETTE INTERFACE
</h2>
<p>
We have received the following letter and article from W. Van Malderen in
Antwerp, which comes as a reply to our request for high speed interfaces. Far be it
from us to ridicule our overseas friend&rsquo;s somewhat idiomatic use of English (and
to that end parts of Mr. Van Malderen&rsquo;s article have been rewritten) but we reproduce
his original letter here uncorrected, as in some strange way we feel it encapsulates
the spirit of experimentally inclined Nascom&nbsp;1 owners. DRH

Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
Until now I was rather a silent overseas member of the INMC, each time waiting
until the next INMC News was published. Then when it arrived, it was again joy for
lots of days. Sometimes the magazine came up with solutions for problems I had,
sometimes it containt programs that could enjoy me, but for some also my children.
</p>
<p>
The only thing that stayed very annoying was the slowness of the cassette
interface. First I speeded it up to 488 baud, thus doubling the standard baudrate
(Nascom&nbsp;1). Finally I found a promising circuit in a Dutch magazine. Then I thought I
couldn&rsquo;t keep this circuit unknown for the fellow INMC members, and I started to write
the additional article. I hope it will help on its turn someone else who struggles
with these problems.
</p>
<p>
To conclude, I wish the INMC News to stay as excellent as it is.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Your sincerely,<br>
W Van Malderen

Although the Nascom&nbsp;1 is a very fine machine (and I have no experience with
the Nascom&nbsp;2), I find that the Nascom&nbsp;1 needs something better than it&rsquo;s standard
cassette interface to avoid frayed nerves during a Read, Write or Verify cycle. An
article in the Dutch magazine &lsquo;Elektuur&rsquo; [published in the UK as Elector. Ed.] of June
1980 brought the solution to this problem. I shall try to summarize the contents of
that article.

Fast cassette interfaces
</h4>
<p>
The most commonly used cassette interfaces employ some form of f.s.k. and
Kansas City (CUTS) standards. The following cassette interface uses the rather more
professional &lsquo;Manchester II&rdquo; standard, which has the following advantages:
</p>
<p class="indent">
&ndash; Clock reclamation is fairly easy as it is a component of the recorded data<br>
&ndash; The circuits are not particularly complex<br>
&ndash; The redundancy (efficiency) is 50%
</p>
<p class="continued">
The redundancy figure being 50% means that the baud rate may be equal to the highest
tone frequency used, the lowest frequency will be half the maximum baud rate and
therefore half the maximum tone frequency used. This means that to use a baud rate to
4800, the cassette recorder has to be capable of reproducing 4.8KHz. Given a recorder
with a response of 10KHz, it would be possible to use a baud rate of 9600, assuming
the read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>write software can go that fast. The version discussed here and used by
myself and several other Belgian Nascom owners, and owners of other Z80 based machines
runs at 3900 baud. This speed can be handled by the existing Nas-bug T4 and Nas-Sys
software. The system has been found to be extremely reliable even on very large tape
files.
</p>
<p>
Generation of the Manchester II system signal is simple and is done by
combining the clock and data signals into a composite signal using a NOR gate, pulses
