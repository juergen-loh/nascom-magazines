Note: Example 3 has used Microsoft&rsquo;s MBASIC in a CP/M environment. Other versions
of Basic may be used in a similar way, but the syntax may need adjusting to suit.
(eg The Nascom version of Basic supports only a single USR function which is
accessed in a slightly different way). The same technique may be employed in other
langauges, the exact approach to take depending upon the way the language executes.
If there is a poll of the keyboard inbetween statements (as in the Basic
interpreter), then the machine code subroutine approach will be necessary,
otherwise the direct port access (WAIT/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>INP etc) can be used satisfactorily.

Example 4&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Single Shot&rdquo; Operation
</h4>
<p>
This example is in fact an extension to example 3, and uses the ESC L and ESC U
commands to provide a &ldquo;single shot&rdquo; operation of the light pen switch. This is done
by downloading a very short program to the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
and calling it before requesting
(or after reading) the light pen coordinates. What the routine does to sit in a
loop until the switch on the light pen is released, and so the switch has to be
released before another pair of coordinates can be read.

Try adding the above subroutines to the code of example 3. Also include
