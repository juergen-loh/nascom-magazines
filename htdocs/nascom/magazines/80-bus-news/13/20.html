Note: Example 3 has used Microsoft&rsquo;s MBASIC in a CP/M environment. Other versions
of Basic may be used in a similar way, but the syntax may need adjusting to suit.
(eg The Nascom version of Basic supports only a single USR function which is
accessed ina slightly different way). The same technique may be employed in other
langauges, the exact approach to take depending upon the way the language executes.
If there is a poll of the keyboard inbetween statements (as in the Basic
interpreter), then the machine code subroutine approach will be necessary,
otherwise the direct port access (WAIT/INP etc) can be used satisfactorily.

EXAMPLE 4 &ndash; &ldquo;SINGLE SHOT&rdquo; OPERATION
</p>
<p>
This example is in fact an extension to example 3, and uses the ESC L and ESC U
commands to provide a &ldquo;single shot&rdquo; operation of the light pen switch. This is done
by downloading a very short program to the IVC and calling it before requesting
(or after reading) the light pen coordinates. What the routine does to sit ina
loop until the switch on the light pen is released, and so the switch has to be
released before another pair of coordinates can be read.
</p>
<p>
Subroutine for the USER area of the IVC card.
</p>
<p>
This subroutine does nothing other than sit in a loop
if the light pen switch is found to be operated.
</p>
<p>
The code will be loaded to the user area at O&amp;400H
put it is position independent anyway.
