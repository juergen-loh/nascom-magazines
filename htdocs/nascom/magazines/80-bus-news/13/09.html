The N command should now work correctly but I am afraid that it still prints that
damned n! The warm start back into Naspen is still achieved by EB806.

Reset Switches
</h4>
<p>
I would like to thank Dusty Pulver for all his CP/M notes which are of
tremendous value to a CP/M novice like me, but just in case no one else has pointed
it out, his reset switch 1 (which resets Nas-Sys) will not give a CP/M warm boot
because the switch is activating the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> reset line and the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> at that point
clears all the Port set up for the disk drive controller card! He will just have to
be content with EO enter from

<u><span class="uppercase">Randomise For Nascom</span> ROM BASIC</u>
</h3>
<p>
One of the niggling omissions from the Nascom ROM BASIC is a <span class="uppercase">Randomise</span>
function, to make the RND function produce unpredictable numbers. This USR callable
subroutine should help a bit.
</p>
<p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-09-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
This can be put anywhere in unused memory by a series of DOKEs, such as:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-09-2.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
It uses the neglected Z80 instruction which reads the refresh register. If
the computer has been waiting for an input from an unpredictable source such as the
user, this will provide a number in the range 0 to 127. This can be used to send
the RND function as in:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
100 A = RND(-USR (0))
</pre>
<p>
This will start one of 127 different sequences of random numbers, which may
still be too predictable for some purposes. In this case, a subroutine to step
through the sequence would be better. This can be called after each INPUT line if
necessary:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
50000 FOR I=0 TO USR(0):A=RND(1):NEXT:RETURN
</pre>
