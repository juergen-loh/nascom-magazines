ON-GOING SITUATIONS
</p>
<p>
Starting off back in the Nascom days, the main expansion memory was the
domestic tape recorder. Using this programs and data were saved for reloading
later. The data transfer rate varied from about 110 Baud upto 2400 Baud. (A
few adventurous souls reached the dizzy heights of 4800 baud). In fact there
must be megabytes of data held on the humble audio cassette, which was
recorded on ordinary domestic tape recorders. The next step on from this was
the arrival of the floppy disk in the form of GM805, followed in a little
while by double and quad density disk drives and the various 80-BUS disk
controller boards. The disk systems offered far higher performance than the
cassette, and after a while those who were using disks began to wonder how on
earth they used to manage with cassette tapes. The trouble is that users&rsquo;
habits change to meet the capabilities of the equipment they use. With the
faster access time of disks they started using multipass compilers, linking
loaders, and a lot of other software that uses disk for the intermediate
storage of data. So after a while the cry goes out again for higher
performance. The next step on is the Winchester disk. This offers high
capacity, (you don&rsquo;t have to keep changing disks), together with faster access
times. But unfortunately it is expensive, requires a specialised controller
(which isn&rsquo;t exactly cheap either!), and is still a mechanical device with the
attendent constraints on access times. By now some programs are manipulating
large amounts of data, and as the system memory is finite (64k), most of this
manipulation is done via intermediate storage on disk. Life would be far
better if more memory was available.

MEMORY EXPANSION
</p>
<p>
Various approaches have been used to expand the address space of the Z80.
The two that 80-BUS readers will be familiar with are the original Nascom
&ldquo;page-mode&rdquo;, where individual memory boards are paged into and out of the
system, and the Gemini memory mapping scheme implemented on the GM813
CPU/Memory board. .
</p>
<p>
Any method of expanding the address space of the Z80 suffers from the
problem that it tends to be unique to a particular system, and no standard
software will support it. Only software written specifically for the system
would be any use, and it is likely that software like that would be extremely
thin on the ground. So the approach being taken now, by a large number of
manufacturers, is to use the extra memory in conjunction with disk operating
systems (DO0Ss), and to make the memory appear as a disk. This solves virtually
all the problems. The DOS handles the management problem of organising data in
the extra memory, and all that has to be added to the BIOS of the disk system,
is a simple driver to convert a disk track/sector read/write request into a
read/write request to a specific area of this extra memory. All the standard
disk software still runs perfectly under the DOS, but any read/write request
to the &ldquo;Memory disk&rdquo; will result in an immediate response. This is because it
only takes a few microseconds to locate the wanted &ldquo;track&rdquo; and &ldquo;sector&rdquo; on the
memory drive, as opposed to tens or hundreds of milliseconds on a mechanical
drive.

HOW CAN WE ADD THE MEMORY?
Let&rsquo;s now consider the various ways of implementing the memory drive.

<p>
Page-Mode
</p>
<p>
The disadvantage of the RAMB/GM802 page mode is that it switches an
entire memory board in and out of the system. Considering the case of GM802 (a
full 64k board) this means that when a board is paged out, the running program
