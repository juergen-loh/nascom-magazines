Now it just so happens that DISKPEN/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GEMPEN (they are one and the same
except for the name) has recently had a major revamp. It now has the ability
to execute overlay programs, and one such, called MAXiFILE, is a &lsquo;free field&rsquo;
data controller of the type described above. With a bit of lateral thinking,
it is easy to see how a text processor can become a free field database. What
are the major requirements of a database controller apart from its ability to
find a given record? They are the ability to display and edit the record. What
does a text processor do? It displays text and allows you to edit it!! So what
does MAXiFILE do? It does the searching bit.
</p>
<p>
Lets make one thing quite clear, MAXiFILE will only work with the new
PEN, that is type VG:3 and release 1.3 or better; and the new PEN will only
work on computers fitted with the Gemini GM812 IVC card, that means Nascoms so
fitted, Gemini Multiboard and Galaxy computers, Quantum 2000s and the Gemini
based version of the Kenilworth Portable computer. Versions will soon be
available for SuperBrain and Mimi computers. New PENs can be purchased from
Gemini and Microvalue dealers at &pound;50.00 + VAT, or upgrades to earlier PENs
only from Henry&rsquo;s Radio at &pound;15.00 + VAT on return of the original distribution
disk to Henry&rsquo;s. MAXiFILE is one of several overlay programs available and is
an optional extra at &pound;20.00 + VAT.

Having got the commercial out of the way. What are the uses that
MAXiFILE can be put? Well I&rsquo;ve been using it for my letters, amongst other
things, as it treats separate disk files (all my letters are saved as single
files) as records on the disk. Having invoked MAXiFILE, it saves the existing
work in hand and asks for the file names to be searched. The reply may be an
unambiguous file name or may be ambiguous using the standard CP/M conventions.
A list of files to be searched is displayed and MAXiFILE prompts for one of
two ways to carry out the search (it also allows you to escape from MAXiFILE
at this point, or to reenter new file names). With MAXiFILE there are two
distinct and different way of carrying out the search, there is the straight
forward &lsquo;find&rsquo; and the rather more complicated and extremely powerful &lsquo;find by
logical expression&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
The straight forward &lsquo;find&rsquo; is simple, supply the key and away it
goes. Now in my letter files the key would usually be the surname of the
person I&rsquo;m looking for, as this would be most likely to be found either in the
name and address block or the salutation of the letter concerned, i.e. Dear
Mr. Bloggs, etc. Of course, if I can&rsquo;t remember the name, then part of the
address, or something in the letter will do. If I can&rsquo;t remember the name or
address or what the letter was about, then MAXiFILE can&rsquo;t help either, as I
might as well have forgotten that the letter ever existed, and certainly have
no right to go looking for it. Anyway, MAXiFILE in the &lsquo;find&rsquo; mode treats each
file as a single record, and searches through for a match with the supplied
&lsquo;find&rsquo; line. As it searches each file it displays the name of the current file
so you know how the search is progressing. If it finds a match, the file is
loaded with the cursor pointing at the first occurence of the match within the
file.
</p>
<p>
Several options are then open to me, to find the next occurence of the
match within the file and if not found continue with the next file. To forget
about this file and skip straight on to the next, to use this file, and to
edit and resave it. To merge it with the file in use before MAXiFILE was
invoked, or to forget the whole idea and continue with what I was doing before
MAXiFILE was invoked. As I said, this mode of searching is very useful for
