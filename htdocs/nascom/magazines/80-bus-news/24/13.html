Overall I found the
<?php externalLink("Climax"); ?>
card very fast indeed and very effective
with no vices. Nothing I did locked it up, either by design or
unintentionally. The documentation, whilst not as thorough as the Nascom was
adequate and the provision of the primitive source listings was most helpful.

<h3>
<u class="uppercase">The Summary.</u>
</h3>
<p>
I have tried to examine the salient points of all three cards, and in
the process have glossed over a lot. I suggest that any potential purchaser
try to get hold of the manuals for all three before making a choice as there
is a lot I have missed here and there may be things which are of some
importance to the potential user that I haven&rsquo;t mentioned at all. As to how I
rated the cards:
</p>
<h4>
<u><?php externalLink("Pluto","",""); ?>.</u>
</h4>
<p>
The worst buy, being expensive and poorly documented. Most suited to
specialist uses and finding its way into broadcast standard equipment. Very
definitely not a cheap way of playing colour space invaders.
</p>
<h4>
<u>Nascom.</u>
</h4>
<p>
The best buy, the cheapest, the best documented and with very adequate
resolution. A little slow in some respects and pity about the 10&Prime; x 8&Prime; card
format, but in all other respects fine.
</p>
<h4>
<u><?php externalLink("Climax","",""); ?>.</u>
</h4>
<p>
The one in the middle nearly equal with the Nascom but let down by the
higher price for slightly lower resolution. The square display leaves margins
on the screen but well worth considering from the speed and provision of the
primitive source listings alone.
