processor, along with its memory management unit, and 64K words of RAM. An
alternative would be to use the Intel 8086 processor, in conjunction with the
Intel 8087 floating point processor, which gives truly amazing speed of
calculation. In either case, the result of using such a board would be a
system that could not be described as old fashioned, as it would be able to
keep up with the latest in hardware, while not wasting the investment in the
existing system. In the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; system, the original main processor would
still be in use, running programs that had as their main function the transfer
of data and programs from one processor board to another. What a good idea the
80-BUS is! [Ed. &ndash; makes you wonder what is so &lsquo;original&rsquo; about the Tycom
MicroFrame claims?]

Here endeth the quotation from the competition entry, and we are back into the
present. Notice that last idea? I&rsquo;am sure that there is no connection between
Micropower and Belectra Ltd, who announced their
<?php externalLink("HSA-88B"); ?>
recently, and am not
for one moment suggesting that they have not had the same idea as I did,
completely independantly. It is an extremely good idea, no matter who had it
first, and I will be ordering a board from them as soon as I get the readies
together. In the meantime, anyone who wants to use any of the other ideas in
the list above is welcome to help themselves, as long as they send me a free
board to review. I am surprised that Belectra have not sent me a board to try
out, and review...

Actually, it is more like a square at the moment, but I expect we can improve
on that! For those of you who are new readers, the old, printed program
library has met its end &ndash; but I thought it would be a good idea to circulate
discs or tapes with programs on, as a substitute for the library. Not many
other people found the time to write and say that they thought so too, and it
nearly didn&rsquo;t get off the ground. Frank Everest WAS convinced, and set a disc
going for the CP/M users with Pertec DSDD drives, which earns him the Real
Enthusiast&rsquo;s Medal (or REM, which gets ignored!), so now there are four of us
swapping our programs. There would have been more, but I lost my list of names
and addresses of people with similar systems. So, if you are wondering what
you said that annoyed me, chaps, it wasn&rsquo;t anything at all! Those who want to
join in the loop for systems compatible with mine had better let me know,
pronto. Users of other systems, tapes, or whatever &ndash; if you want to run some
sort of exchange, it won&rsquo;t happen if you sit on your hands and wait for it! So
far, I have had free copies of some quite clever CP/M utilities, and have
given away a couple of games I wrote or adapted, and the source code for
boring old
<a href="../../../../micropower/12/12/text/#article1">MONITOR.COM</a>.
It may not sound like a lot, but it is more than
nothing at all, which is what you get if you do nothing...

Since they seem to be too busy to let the editor know what ports the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?> uses, or send me details of the price of the
<?php externalLink("Mini Palette","palette"); ?> board, I will copy the
relevant information out of the Pluto manual. (I wonder why nobody who sells
Pluto boards has thought of looking in there? I thought I was the only one who
only looked in the manual as a last resort!) I quote from the manual, with
slight changes to avoid being accused of ripping it off... [Ed. &ndash; see
<a href="../../../23/26/text/#article1">article on IO mapping</a>
<a href="../../21/text/#article1">elsewhere</a>.] This seems to cover all the questions asked,
although it does not say whether the recently announced pallette board, for
which I am willing to sell my soul, is to use the spare two ports. I expect it
does, as I can not think of any other use for then...
