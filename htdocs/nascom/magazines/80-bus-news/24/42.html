All examples given in this work are in <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>, which translates easily
to BASIC, but the author&rsquo;s background as a Professor of Mathematics assumes a
certain mathematical background on the part of the reader, and a familiarity
with Group and Set manipulation that has long since eluded me.

On the same subject, I draw the attention of interested readers to:

<b>&ldquo;Computer Applications in Archaeology 1974&nbsp;&ndash; 1982&rdquo;</b> (continuing) mostly
available from Dept. of Archaeolgy, University of Birmingham, at a price of

These 60/100 page Journals are the Proceedings of the Annual Conference
on Quantitative methods in Archaelogy (or Computer methods or similar&nbsp;&ndash; the
name is not always constant) and consist of the typescripts of most of the
papers delivered. The fields are widely ranging&nbsp;&ndash; use of the computer as an
excavation recording teminal, graphic recreation of pot shapes, cluster.
analysis of collections of (guess what?) Axeheads. They seem to use the
computer for nearly everything but Word processing! If you are an
archaeologist, try and get your hands on these&nbsp;&ndash; your University Library may
have them. They will certainly give you ideas about the use of computers in
Archaeology&nbsp;&ndash; perhaps you will be able to bring some of the flexibility of the
80-BUS systems into that field in return. Digression: consider how many
professions depend on literary output. E.g. Barristers, Orthopaedic
Consultants, Archaelogists, Historians. How many of these even consider using
a &lsquo;Word processor&rsquo;? Fools! To avoid argument, let me state here that it
doesn&rsquo;t matter what an archaeologist digs up if he doesn&rsquo;t write it up. I know
one orthpaedic consultant who spends more than half his time dictating reports
and opinions on patients for legal proceedings arising from the accidents that
brought them to his attention. The other half of his time he spends doctoring
&ndash; he can even recognise patients from their X-rays&nbsp;&ndash; but that is another
story. End digression.

One of the fields opening up is the use of the microprocessor in control
of machinery. With our detailed knowledge of the intricacies of the Z80, and
the powerful and reasonably priced CPU cards available to us, it is practical
for us to consider their use in control applications, and perhaps even to
advise on it. Consider what can be done with a CPU, a serial I/O, and a <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>. A
simple control program can be blown in EPROM and then the CPU card can control
almost anything. A marvellous read on this subject is:

Inc., costing approx &pound;22.

This is a most enjoyable book on the philosophy and practicalities of
using purpose built controllers for industrial applications. In addition to
dealing with the hardware interfacing necessary, the author deals with the
debugging and user friendlying necessary if such a machine is to work
successfully. He deals with a number of projects based on his own experience,
giving copious examples of what happened, and what went wrong, with the object
of guiding you away from these sticky areas. In spite of the expense, I feel
that this book should be on the bookshelves of every inplant engineer. The
author takes a light-hearted approach to the problems, making the book
enjoyable and easy to read, but never lightweight or trivial.
