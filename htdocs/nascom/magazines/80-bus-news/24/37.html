If the RAM-DISK memory was addressed on a byte-by-byte basis, the data
transfer rate would be slowed, and the board would be rather clumsy to use.
However Gemini have optimised the board for use with CP/M, and have made the
interface disk-like. (See Fig&nbsp;1).
</p>
<p>
One can regard the three IO ports as &lsquo;track&rsquo;, &lsquo;sector&rsquo;, and &lsquo;data&rsquo;. The
address applied to the memory array is made up of three components: A0-A6
coming from the seven-bit counter, A7-A14 from the &lsquo;sector&rsquo; latch, and A15-A18
from the &lsquo;track&rsquo; latch. In addition, the four high &lsquo;address&rsquo; lines from the
&lsquo;track&rsquo; latch are compared with an on-board DIL switch to provide an enable
signal to the memory array.
</p>
<p>
The seven-bit counter is controlled in two ways: Whenever data is written
into the &lsquo;track&rsquo; register, the counter is cleared. Whenever data is
read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>written to the data port the counter is incremented. Thus the memory
array can be regarded as a disk of sixteen tracks, (the low four bits of the
&lsquo;track&rsquo; register), with 256 sectors per track, (eight bits of the &lsquo;sector&rsquo;
register), and with 128 bytes per sector, (the seven bits of address from the
counter). So transfers to and from the RAM-DISK occur in blocks (or &lsquo;sectors&rsquo;)
of 128 bytes each. A typical CP/M driver for the board would look like:

&ndash; very simple and fast!
</p>
<p>
This way of adding extra memory, as well as being more economical in its
requirements for support software, is also economical in hardware. In the case
of a paged or mapped memory board, the memory has to be designed to work at
the full speed of the shortest Z80 memory cycle &ndash; the M1. and refresh cycle.
With the IO approach the memory array only has to meet the more relaxed
specification of an IO cycle, thus allowing slower and cheaper RAMs to be
used, and leading to a more reliable board with larger margins on critical
timing paths.

&ndash; What you get</u>
</h3>
<p>
Now we&rsquo;ve covered the principles &ndash; what about the product?
</p>
<p>
The RAM-DISK comes in the familiar Gemini packaging. On unpacking you
find a ready assembled 8x8 board. The board is to the usual Gemini standard,
with plated-through holes, silk screen component identification, and solder
resist. The first thing you notice is that almost exactly half the board holds
a dense array of ICs, the 64 64k dynamic RAMS of the RAM-DISK. The remaining
ICs, (15 in all), handle the BUS interface, and the control of the array.
</p>
<p>
Accesses to the memory array, and refresh of the memory array, are
controlled by the one large (40-pin) IC on the board. This is the Texas
Instruments TMS4500A dynamic RAM controller.
</p>
<p>
Also included on the leading edge of the board is an LED, an activity
indicator which illuminates every time the board is accessed.
</p>
<p>
A concise manual is included with the board, together with a circuit
diagram. The manual follows the usual Gemini format, and gives a description
of how the circuit works, together with a small section on software to drive
the board. The software section is not extensive, and assumes that the board
will be used in conjunction with a CP/M BIOS. (See below). It also gives an
indication of how a BASIC program could drive the board directly.
