It is highly unlikely that I will be upgrading to the Intel series of
8086 or 8088 chips especially as Zilog have announced the Z800 series where
the specification reads as if it were tailor made for the 80-BUS. I feel that
it is a sufficiently big chip to last me for the next 10 years.
</p>
<p>
We all know that BASIC is the language that everybody loves to hate but
everybody is using it, there is so much software written in it that to abandon
it would be very short sighted. Couple to this the ability to run in
interpreted mode until the program works and then compile it to run faster and
to protect your code and you have a combination of software for developing
applications programs that work.
</p>
<p>
Having said all this in praise of the humble Z80 chip and CP/M systems
all that is needed is for some volunteer to come forward to write this
program. All serious contenders please call me on ____ ______.

<u>Non-communicating Dodos</u>
</h3>
<p>
It appears that most of you (at 80-BUS News) feel rather upset that Dodos
like myself do not communicate more regularly.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m sorry about this, but I would point out that a major characteristic
of a dodo is its lack of communicable ideas.
</p>
<p>
Two possible reasons for your upset, it seems to me, are:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
i) you feel that the ratio of contributors to subscribers is far too low<br>
ii) you wonder whether there is any real demand for the mag.
</p>
<p>
Now it seems to me that, if you take these fears seriously, the solution
is easy: cut down the number of subscribers. I have no idea what the number
is, but it must be reasonable for your contributors to wonder what we&rsquo;re all
doing (fiddling with our appendages Chris, but we call it &lsquo;getting on with
life&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>
I think that this approach is silly, and that a large number of
subscribers, at &pound;2.25 an issue (&pound;9/6 issues per year = &pound;2.25 if 6=4 as it did
last year) is something to be proud of, but a way of implementing it, if you
really want to, is to return the &pound;9 if it is not accompanied by usable
material for the mag.
</p>
<p>
If you think that anyone but me will read articles on what I do with my
Nascom&nbsp;2 /
<?php externalLink("GM805"); ?>
with DCSDOS II /
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
(baby) /
<?php externalLink("IMP","Imp"); ?> then you are mistaken, as
it <u>doesn&rsquo;t work anyway</u>.
</p>
<p>
If you think that all we dodos are sitting on a goldmine of ideas, you
fail to recognise that YOU WROTE THE GOLDMINE!!!
</p>
<p>
As long as I can keep buying it, I will read it!

<u>The Final Word</u>
</h3>
<p>
I wrote to you on 14/4/83 to ask why there were only 4 issues of 80-BUS
News 1982 when you clearly stated there would be 6. I have not yet had a
reply.
</p>
<p>
I enclose a cheque for &pound;9 for a years subscription in the final hope that
things will improve; although performance so far is not good. There can be few
excuses left.
