shadow mask of the tube and tube size. The bigger the tube, the more lines it
should resolve. Some manufacturers quote the vertical resolution at the centre
of the tube, meaning that the total resolution across the face of the tube
would be this figure if the tube was good enough. It is reasonable to expect
some roll off towards the edges, but not too drastic roll off. Checking the
deflection angle can be of some help here. 90 degree tubes do not roll off so
much at the edges as 110 degree tubes. Most monitors are fitted with 90 degree
tubes for this reason.
</p>
<p>
Don&rsquo;t fall for the old trick of looking for a high input bandwidth,
all this means is that the electronics are up to it, but says nothing about
the tube characteristics. 24MHz bandwidth might imply that the monitor is
capable of 800 line resolution, but what is to stop the manufacturer fitting a
low res. tube, whereas, a quoted resolution of 800 lines means that both the
electronics and the tube must be capable of the job.
</p>
<p>
A low res. monitor would typically have a 12&Prime; or 14&Prime; tube and resolve
400 lines at the centre of the display (less at the edges, although this
shouldn&rsquo;t be too much less, perhaps 350 lines). This resolution is about the
same as a 14&Prime; colour TV (and is probably where the tube came from in the first
place) and is adequate for the
<?php externalLink("Climax"); ?>
and just about for the Nascom card.
These are typically in the &pound;200 to &pound;300 range.
</p>
<p>
The next are the medium res. monitors with about 600 lines resolution
for a 12&Prime; or 14&Prime; tube. Entirely suitable for the Nascom card in the normal
eight colour mode, and the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
at a push. Typical prices are in the &pound;300 to
&pound;400 range. The higher price is dictated by the purpose made tube with its
finer shadow mask. It is highly probable that the electronics are identical to
the equivalent low res. version. This is certainly true between the KAGA
Vision&nbsp;&ndash; I and Vision&nbsp;&ndash; II where the difference in price is solely down to the
tube.
</p>
<p>
Lastly are the real high res. monitors with 800 line or better
resolution. These are very costly, between &pound;450 and &pound;2000 depending upon the
size of the tube, in fact the major part of the cost is the purpose made tube,
so tube guarantees and insurance are well worth exploring.
</p>
<p>
Monitors will most probably have one of two types of input, logic,
where the input is either a colour at full saturation or off (black), or
analogue where the intensity of the colour is related to the level of the
input voltage. Some monitors are switchable in this respect. Logic inputs are
suitable for the Nascom card and the Pluto card (if expansion to the
<?php externalLink("Mini Palette","Pluto Palette"); ?>
is not envisaged). The Climax requires an analogue input as does the
Pluto Palette.

Various monitors and an old Philips TV were used with the colour
cards. Those used were the:

<p>
All were found to satisfactory within their specifications (except the
TV, which was awful). The analogue input on the Luxor was found to be quite
linear and could double as a TV repeater monitor. The KAGA inputs were not
quoted as being analogue, but were found to be reasonably linear although not
as good as the Luxor.
