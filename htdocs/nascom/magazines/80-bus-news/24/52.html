area of the disc that contains no useful data, (it has only just been
allocated to the file), the BIOS has no need to pre-read the sectors from the
disc, and the system performance will increase as a result. However the BDOS
only tells the BIOS on the very first sector of the area, and not on every
sector. Thus the BIOS has to maintain a flag, (saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m writing unallocated
data&rdquo;), and maintain a record of the next drive/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>track/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sector expected. If the
unallocated flag is set, it compares the next request against the stored
values to check that the write is following in sequence. As long as this
continues, it knows it can dispense with pre-reads.

<p>
As an example here are the results of doing a &ldquo;SAVE 128 JUNK&rdquo; on a
Micropolis Drive&ndash;
</p>
<table class="micropolis-drive">
<tr><td>As normal (No unnecessary pre-read):</td><td>5.6 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>C always forced to 0 on Write:</td><td>18.5 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>C always forced to 1 on Write:</td><td>57.0 seconds</td></tr>
<tr><td>Finally a Double density system, but with a physical sector size of
128 bytes. (i.e. no Blocking/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>deblocking)</td><td>11.5&nbsp;seconds.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The latter is a bit artificial, as the timing figure can be varied widely
by altering the sector skew, but I hope I picked a figure in line with the
Gemini skew. Anyway it gives an indication of performance.
</p>
<p>
I trust that equiped with the above in one hand, and the relavent section
of the BIOS in the other, you can make some sense of the blocking-deblocking
code within a few iterations.
