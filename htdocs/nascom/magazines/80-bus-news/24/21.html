<u>80&ndash;BUS IO MAP &ndash; PART 2.</u>
</h2>
<p>
In the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue a brief summary of the I/O ports currently occupied by
80-BUS/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nasbus compatible boards was given, along with a request for any
corrections to this and for any information on products not included. The
following paragraphs are extracts from various letters received in response to
the above request. Thanks to all concerned.

<h3>
<u>Pluto</u>
</h3>
<p>
Doctor Dark writes: &ldquo;Only two I/O ports are required for communication with
Pluto. The ports have consecutive addresses that may be selected to be on any
20H byte boundary. Pluto decodes 4 addresses, two of which are not used, but
are reserved for future use. Pluto is pre-configured with a base address of A0
hex. This can be changed to any of 00, 20, 40, 60, 80, C0, or E0, all of which
are in hex, of course. For compatibility with Nascom systems a NASIO signal is
optionally provided by Pluto. Only one board in the entire system should
provide this signal which is asserted when an IO address for the Nascom main
board is decoded. If this signal is to be provided by Pluto then the points
marked NASIO should be linked. Pluto asserts this signal for all addresses
from 00 to 7F hex inclusive which means that all peripheral boards (including
Pluto) should use I/O addresses above 80 hex. The Nascom Internal/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>External I/O
addressing switch must be set to enable external addressing. For compatibility
with Nascom&nbsp;1 systems, a DBDR option is provided by linking the points
marked.&rdquo;

<h3>
<u>Graphics Board</u>
</h3>
<p>
Mr R. E. Moyle writes: &ldquo;You may not be aware of S. Holmes&rsquo; Graphics Board.
This board uses ports 8 &ndash; 31 to control a Texas Colour Graphics chip, two
sound generators, a RTC, CMOS scratchpad memory and eight ADCs. Unfortunately
the board is not fully 80-BUS compatible as it omits the &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; signals
and daisy-chain protocols. These are easily added, however, and moving the I/O
addresses to 32 &ndash; 63 is also simple.&rdquo;
</p>
<h3>
<u>CMOS RAM and RTC</u>
</h3>
<p>
CHS Data Sciences write: &ldquo;We have produced a board which:
</p>
<p>
a) has 16K of CMOS RAM and a Real Time Clock which also detects power up/down
and reset conditions.
</p>
<p>
b) standard I/O address is D0-D3, no alternative is suggested until such time
as an I/O map is produced, the link selectable header plug may be changed for
any contiguous block of 4 on a boundary of 4, paged memory is also on port
FFH.
</p>
<p>
c) NASIO and DBDR are provided from open-collector gates with NASIO also being
link selected
</p>
<p>
d) the board is fully Nasbus 4 compatible
</p>
<p>
e) the memory is page selected by port FFH, additionally it will always be
selected on page&nbsp;0 (selected by reset) regardless of page switch setting, this
ensures that the board controls power up/down and &lsquo;manual&rsquo; resets
</p>
<p>
This board does not use the National Semiconductor Real Time Clock and so it
does produce the Year Date, the clock is supplied via a on-board battery so
maintaining clocking integrity.&rdquo;

<u>IO Research A/D Board</u>

it uses ports 20-23, NOT 30-33 as described in your magazine.&rdquo;
