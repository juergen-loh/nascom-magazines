<u>Re. COMPAS Review</u>
</h3>
<p>
I saw that
<a href="../../../23/54/text/#article1">COMPAS was reviewed by Doctor Dark</a>
(your graduate in Voodoo
medicine?) in vol. 2 iss. 3, and although I am always pleased to see our
products mentioned in articles, in this case I was less excited, since the
product reviewed is COMPAS version 1, and not version 2, which is a far better
package.
</p>
<p>
As opposed to COMPAS 1 and <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal, COMPAS 2 is a superset of
Standard Pascal, i.e. it supports all features of the standard language, plus
many more. The extensions that are most noteworthy are dynamic strings, random
access files, structured constants, include files and, in the latest version
(called 2.20) also overlays. All extensions are carefully thought out, and to
a large extent are compatible with other well known Pascal systems, such as
<?php externalLink("UCSD Pascal"); ?> and Pascal MT+.
</p>
<p>
Programs written in COMPAS 2 can be distributed with no royalties
payable. We realise that the terms set forward in the COMPAS 1 license
agreement were a bit harsh, not to mention the fact that they were impossible
to implement. Therefore there are <u>no royalties</u> on programs written using
COMPAS 2.
</p>
<p>
I feel that COMPAS 2 is the ideal package for anyone who wishes to learn
about Pascal since it supports the full standard, it is also ideal for
experienced programmers since the extensions make this a very powerful
implementation of Pascal indeed.

<u>MBASIC on Disk</u>
</h3>
<p>
I read with great interest the
<a href="../../../23/13/text/#article1">article by Dr. Coker</a>
in the last issue of
80-BUS News and it is obvious that he has looked at his BASIC in great detail
but has not done sufficient programming in it to find the error in his use of
the substitute REM statement. In particular he will find that while you can
use the apostrophe (27H) either at the start of the line or in the middle, if
used in this latter position it is necessary to include a colon to seperate it
from the previous command or that program could crash as BASIC will not know
where to stop interpreting and treat the remainder of the line as a REM
statement.
</p>
<p>
His second comment that MBASIC is regularly updated may have been correct
but reading the trade press one is lead to believe that MBASIC-80 is a
casualty of the CP/M versus MSDOS war, and that Microsoft will not be
supporting it for CP/M-80 in the future.
</p>
<p>
Since the 80-BUS is essentially a Z80 bus which runs CP/M and we are not
too interested in &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; operating systems such as MSDOS, what is needed
for the next 10 years is a UK supported BASIC, starting with the core
instructions of MBASIC and having extensions to cover the following:
</p>
<p>
(a) Use of full Z80 instruction set
</p>
<p>
(b) Include additional commands such as cursor addressing, clearing
screen, reverse video and other terminal attributes
</p>
<p>
(c) Enabling the BASIC interpreter or compiler to address more than one
64K page of memory where it is available
</p>
<p>
The principle reason why so called 16 bit machines have gained in
popularity is because most of the software available to run under CP/M uses
only the <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> instruction set and not the enhanced instruction set of the Z80
which we all know and love!
