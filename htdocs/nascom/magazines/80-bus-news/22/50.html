<p class="continued">
other Thursday at the Frogmore Hotel, Alma Road, Windsor. Anyway, the Thames
Rip-off Society, sorry, NAS-TUG have what they call an organised evening on one
Thursday followed by what they call a disorganised workshop evening the
following Thursday fortnight. They attract members from a very wide catchment
area (I&rsquo;ve even been known to go along myself and I don&rsquo;t exactly live in
Windsor) because they&rsquo;re a friendly bunch. Membership is not restricted to
Nascom owners&nbsp;&ndash; if their latest newsletter is to be believed, a couple of
members are currently &lsquo;down-grading their equipment to Gemini&rsquo; and one member
admits to owning an Osbourne but comes along to find out what real computing is
about. Details of who to contact can be sought through The Chertsey Computer
Centre or Henry&rsquo;s Radio. Sorry to mention shops, but they are the only places I
can remember who would know the relevant numbers. (There you are Mark, a plug,
now how about bumping our circulation up a bit by enlightening many of YOUR
members who are unaware of OUR existence.)

<u>CCPZ Revisited.</u>
</h3>
<p>
To follow up my piece about CCPZ elsewhere in this mag, I made comment
about having a go at persuading CCPZ to accept something like .13 as a command
line, that is using the full stop in place of the command word USER because it&rsquo;s
three letters less to type. Well during a chat with Mike Waters of Norwich, who
was using CCPZ and had fixed a bug concerning the way CCPZ generates form feeds,
I mentioned my problem, and he has since kindly sent me a fixed version with the
form feed bug fixed and the full stop fully implemented. In fact he notes that
it was quite surprising that the command line parser did what it did when I
tried to make it go as, of course, a full stop is the delimiter between the file
name and the file type. So of course, it should have gone away and looked for a
file called " &nbsp; .13&nbsp;" or some such. I guess the strange behaviour I
experienced was something to do with the way I patched the full stop command
into the command line parser, oh well .... I can&rsquo;t have been thinking at the
time, &rsquo;cos I should have twigged that .13, or such like, would in fact be
interpreted as a file name. Whether I would have come up with a solution quite
as elegant as Mikes and got it in the remaining space .... well that&rsquo;s a
different matter.

<h3>
<u>Databases.</u>
</h3>
<p>
And so at long last it should now come round to the DH bit about
databases. I say &lsquo;should&rsquo;, because I&rsquo;ve run out of time to write it. Paul has
been nagging me for this copy for the last week and this edition is well behind
time as it is. So it looks as if there is going to be no discourse on databases
from me this episode (do I hear cries of shame??). Any way it is perhaps as
well, as with the arrival of MAXiFILE the data handler for PEN, it forms a very
relevant transition from the simple to the all laughing dancing databases
(future episodes to come). So this &lsquo;lay-off&rsquo; for a few weeks will give me a
chance to master MAXiFILE and see exactly how good it is.
</p>
<h3>
<u>Coming Soon!</u>
</h3>
<p>
Future writings from the DH PEN are also planned. I&rsquo;ve recently had the
opportunity to spend some considerable time playing with all three of the
popular colour cards for 80-BUS/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>NASBUS&nbsp;&ndash; the Nascom
<?php externalLink("AVC","",""); ?>,
the Climax MV256 and the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
card (that&rsquo;s why this article is incomplete this time). Anyway I&rsquo;ll be
writing at length about colour cards over the next couple of weeks. Whilst I&rsquo;m
at it, I&rsquo;ll also be talking to a colleague at Paddington Tech who is having a go
at interfacing a BBC model B to a Gemini as an intelligent terminal. He thinks
it will provide him with all the colour and hi-res (about 320 x 256) he wants
and save him the cost of buying a keyboard and a video card in to the bargain.
Should be fun if he ever gets that beastly thing called the &lsquo;Tube&rsquo; to work. I
don&rsquo;t think Acorn know how it works, so who else do you ask?
