Another nice little tweek is the prompt itself, when you change USER

<p>
the

As to the commands, well all the original CP/M

</p>
<p>
If the directory is scanned for a name and no such name exists on the
disk the message &lsquo;No Files&rsquo; will be displayed. However, if the search
was for $DIR files and the file existed as a $SYS file or vice versa,
then no message will be displayed indicating that the file does exist
but the file attribute is not as specified.
</p>
<p>
BRA
</p>
<p>
To erase the specified R/W file from the directory.
</p>
<p>

The name(s) of the file(s) erased is displayed as a cross check.
</p>
<p>
