I get around the inconsistency of some programs using CR and others
using CR and LF at line ends as follows. The printer procedure
ignores LF&rsquo;s completely, and converts CR to LF before sending it to
the printer, which has AUTO FEED off. CH is converted to CR in order
to preserve compatibility with Nas-Sys cursor control. The MX80&rsquo;s
block graphic character set has different codes to Nas-Graphics. This
short procedure converts from Nascom to Epson graphcs:

Finally, I disagree with David Hunt&rsquo;s comments about XON/XOFF
protocol. At work I am user of small computers (mainly
<?php externalLink("PDP-11", "PDP 11", ""); ?>),
which use only this protocol. Both in terms of cabling costs and
interface simplicity it is greatly to be preffered to handshaking
with DTR etc. Indeed, few DEC interfaces support handshake lines, and
XON/XOFF is the only available method for 20mA current loop
communication.
