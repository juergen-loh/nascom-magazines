I get around the inconsistency of some programs using CR and others
using CR and LF at line ends as follows. The printer procedure
ignores LF&rsquo;s completely, and converts CR to LF before sending it to
the printer, which has AUTO FEED off. CH is converted ta CR in order
to preserve compatibility with Nas-Sys cursor controi. The MX8O"s
block graphic character set has different codes to Nas-Graphics. This
short procedure converts from Nascom to Epson graphes:

Finally, I disagree with David Hunt*s comments about =ON/AOFF
protocol. At work fF am aiuser of small computers (mainly PDF 11},
which use only this protecal. Both in terms of cabling costs and
interface simplicity it is greatiy to be preffered tao handshaking
with DTR etc. Indeed, few DEC interfaces suopert nNandshake lines. and
XON/ ZOFF is the only available method for Z20mA current ilooo
cammunicatian.
