D000 EPROM will go in socket B1 and D400 EPROM in socket B2. Note that ROM ZEAP
usually lives at D000 so if you keep ZEAP there you will have to tell Ikon where
you wish to put their software. Remember that one of the advantages of a reliable
storage system like the Hobbit is that utility programs such as ZEAP, Nasdis,
Debug, Pascal and Forth may be used efficiently without using up all your
valuable 64 KByte memory page.

<p>
The commands and error messages are listed with this article but are much
better explained in the Hobbit Booklet. A good description is given of how to use
the Hobbit routines in programs. This is so important for educational work where
there is a constant need to record results and use large quantities of data. The
example program is good but I would have liked a couple more, particularly one
inputting data from the tape into the program. It says much for the documentation
of the Hobbit and of NasSys&nbsp;3 that I have been able to adapt the system to suit
our special requirements. Believe me, if I can do it anyone can. I will willingly
supply any other school with a copy of my EPROM at cost if they write to me. You
will probably prefer to use the information to taylor your own system. I believe
that although no source code is provided the Hobbit manual provides all the
addresses needed and is a good compromise between perfect documentation and cost.

<p>
Finally I must add how using the unit with Blue Label Pascal (now Nascom
Pascal) has totally changed my preparation of educational programs. All my
Procedures and Functions are recorded onto the Hobbit cassette that contains the
Pascal itself. I can get 69 on one side and 58 on the side with the Pascal on. I
can find the ones I need for a program quickly, and load them automatically while
I drink my coffee. I never have to type the same routine twice, or write one out
to keep. I have vowed never to use BASIC again.
</p>
<p>
But of course the ten and eleven year olds in the school do use BASIC,
and the automatic operation of the Hobbit has made things much easier for them
too.
</p>
<p>
A super value product, but I hope I have made clear its limitations
without playing down its potential. The manufacturers are most courteous and
helpful on the telephone and delivery is very fast and efficient. Our school
units were posted two days BEFORE our cheque could possibly have arrived.
