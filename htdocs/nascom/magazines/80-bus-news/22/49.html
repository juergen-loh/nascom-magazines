which has only recently come to light. I know this affects all SYSB versions
from SYSB11 onwards, although it was correct in versions up to SYSN7 for the
<?php externalLink("Henelec","",""); ?>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM805"); ?>
system (I haven&rsquo;t got copies of the earlier versions so it
may or may not be relevant). Now to allow the CBIOS to cope with spooler type
software CP/M&nbsp;2.2 allows a call to the LST: device status to be made whilst
polling the keyboard to check if the LST: device is ready to accept further
data. In this way a file can be shoved out to the printer whilst keyboard input
is taking place. Hence allowing printer despooling to take place. If the LST:
status is busy then no printer action can take place. SYS of course allows this
with a separate LST: status routine, unfortunately by an oversight, it checks
both serial and parallel routines together and if either is busy it reports
busy. Now most users don&rsquo;t have two printers attached so it is likely that
either the serial or parallel output will be floating. By the fact that it&rsquo;s
floating, it could either return busy or not busy as it feels, Murphy&rsquo;s Law says
it will return busy, so the likelihood is that spooler operation will be either
erratic or non existence, depending &hellip; No-one has reported this, but I feel
that several people have tried and wondered what is wrong with their despooling
software and then given up, alternatively if they have tried their despooling
software under Gemini&rsquo;s CP/Ms they should have had no problem. In SYSB15 and
SYSB16 a simple change to the end of module SYSB5 will cure this problem and is
listed as program 3. Whilst on the subject of SYS, SYS fetishists may be upset
to know that SYSB16.1 already exists. If you have SYSB15 don&rsquo;t worry, SYSB16
only incorporated a printer margin facility and a software tidy up, whilst
SYSB16.1 fixes the aforementioned &lsquo;feature&rsquo;. [Late insert: Richard tells me
SYSB17 is on the way with a reported bug in the extended screen edit routine
fixed.]

<u>Super Diskpen.</u>

<p>
Another &lsquo;feature&rsquo; built in to the response to an advert in the last
issue regards the new Super Diskpen&nbsp;&ndash; those who ordered it didn&rsquo;t get any
documentation!!! Not too disastrous for those who know how to drive PEN, or
those who discovered what the &lsquo;?&rsquo; and &lsquo;??&rsquo; commands do. However, documentation
was promised and the advertiser had a file of names and addresses of those who
had purchased PEN for the purposes of sending on the documentation. Don&rsquo;t ask me
how it happened, but the file has got lost. So if you&rsquo;re sitting there staring
at a PEN command line and wondering what to do next drop the advertiser a line
and let him know your name and address.
</p>
<p>
Another command in <span class="uppercase">Diskpen</span>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GEMPEN version 3 is the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; command. Some
late versions may have been supplied with an overlay called MENU.OVL, and you
may be wondering what this is for. When the &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; command is fired up, the menu
tells you about a spooling device which allows PEN to have an intelligent
printer despooling function built in. This is the first of the PEN overlays
which are becoming available, and incedently, how the funny in the spooling
software in SYS came to light.
</p>
<p>
A second overlay for PEN has just been sent to me for evaluation and
this one is really clever. It gives PEN the ability to function as a free field
data handler. A sort of mini-database controller which whilst not as powerful as
the big business type database controllers has a number of advantages over the
way the data is formatted, and like all PEN &lsquo;bolt-on&rsquo; goodies, it is cheap.
About one twentieth the price of dBASE&nbsp;II for instance for about one quarter the
power. If you are worrying about not having MENU.OVL&nbsp;&ndash; don&rsquo;t!! When a new
overlay program is purchased a new MENU.OVL is supplied with it covering all the
previous issues. But don&rsquo;t forget that these overlays can only be used with
version 3 of PEN, and the signon will be VG:3x, VN:3x or VS:3x, where x is the
type of printer output configured.
