</p>
<p>
The Graphpac workspace will be located just below the relocated package at
6F00 hex.
</p>
<p>
If it is intended to run Nas-Graphpac in ROM it will be necessary to
locate the Graphpac workspace in the low memory area ODOO &ndash; 1000 hex. This can
be achieved by entering the following command line.
</p>
<p>
E 1000 aasa L (enter)
</p>
<p>
where asaa is the address at which the program will run and where L is
the letter D,E or F to indicate which 100 hex bytes in the low memory area
is to be used. D equates to ODOO hex etc. This decision will depend on what
other software is running on the syaten.
</p>
<p>
The relocation process in both cases is straight forward and when
complete the user will be prompted to make a tape copy of the generated
version at its execution sddress (a copy is placed at 4000 hex. if RAM is not
available at the target address). Once this tape is made the original
Nas-Graphpac tape will not be needed unless a new version is required at a
different address, and should be kept in a safe place as a master backup tape.

<p>
It is essential that you do not ask the relocator to configure
Nas-Graphpac so that it crosses the 32K address boundary. If you have a 16k
Nascom system you can only configure Nas-Graphpac to start at 4800 hex. If you
have a Nascom equipped with 32K or more, never ask the relocator to address
Graphpac between 7801 hex and 7FFF hex. as it is probable that the package
will not work correctly.
</p>
<p>
EXECUTING NAS-GRAPHPAC (COLD START)
</p>
<p>
It is important that if CGsort&rsquo;s Nas-Debug is active on the system, it
should be disabled by pressing RESET or executing Nas-sys at address zero or
by using the Nas-sys N command before Nas-Graphpac is used.
</p>
<p>
Your generated Nas-Graphpac must first be loaded using the Nas-sys
READ command. Execute WNas-Graphpac at the first address that was displayed
during the READ process, i.e.
</p>
<p>
B 7000 (enter)
</p>
<p>
where Graphpac was relocated originally at 7000 hex.
</p>
<p>
Nas-Graphpac will be initialised together with the BASIC and an
attempt to set the MEMORY SIZE at 101 hex bytes below Nas-Graphpac will be
made irrespective of the position of the Nas-Graphpac workspace. If Nas-Graphpac
resides in ROM, the MEMORY SIZE message will be printed and the
normal BASIC cold start procedure is used.
</p>
<p>
If it is wished to set the MEMORY SIZE Manually this can be achieved
by entering a second argument on execution.
</p>
<p>
&amp; 7000 SYFF (enter)
</p>
<p>
Graphpac will be executed at address 7000 hex and the MEMORY SIZE will
be set at SFFF hex. This will be confirmed on entry to BASIC as the free
memory size will be printed in decimal. If the second argument entered is
invalid, the MEMORY SIZE message will de displayed and the user will be
prompted to enter the correct value (in decimal). DO NoT just press the enter
key without entering a decimal value if this point is reached, unless
Nas-Graphpac resides in ROM.
</p>
<p>
EXECUTING NAS-GRAPHPAC (warm start)
</p>
<p>
If the user has returned to Nas-sys, Nas-Graphpac and BASIC may be
re-entered by executing Nas-Graphpac at it&rsquo;s normal execution address. (The
same as cold start.)
</p>
<p>
EB 7000 (enter)
</p>
<p>
A second argument should not be entered unless the user is aware of
</p>
<p>
the consequences as explained in appendix 2.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
ENTERING NAS-GRAPHPAC COMMANDS
</p>
<p>
Nas-Graphpac commands can be entered in the DIRECT MODE or as part of
a statement line. If the command is to be entered while in the DIRECT MODE, it
must ALWAYS be preceded by a colon (:) otherwise a syntax error will occur.
Nas-Graphpac commands can be used as part of a statement line using normal
BASIC conventions except a colon must precede a Nas-Graphpac command that
follows the word THEN in an IF THEN statement.
</p>
<p>
BASIC variable and array names should not match Nas-Graphpac command
names. (although this is usually acceptable if a LET is not implied and the
word LET is used in a statement line.)
</p>
<p>
BASIC PROGRAM EXECUTION TIME
</p>
<p>
Every care has been taken to ensure the graphic routines execute as
fast as possible and speed problems should not be encountered while actually
producing graphic displays, however, there ig a time overhead caused by
searching the Graphpac command table, before deciding whether Graphpac or
BASIC is to take control. In long program loops that do not include
Nas-Graphpac commands (i.e. setting up a large array) it may be worth while
disabling Graphpac temporarily. This is achieved by the following line which
POKE&rsquo;s the N.M.I. flag in BASIC&rsquo;s workspace.
</p>
<p>
POKE 41&rsquo;73,0
</p>
<p>
Before a Nas-Graphpac command is executed, the N.M.I. flag must again
</p>
<p>
be modified with the following line
POKE 4175,1
</p>
<p>
This facility should only be used in a program where the execution
speed is critical. An INPUT statement, keyboard interrupt or a return to the
direct mode will cause Graphpac to be enabled.
</p>
<p>
Another problem with program speed is associated with screen blanking.
It is possible to plot and erase short lines on the screen extremely quickly,
so much so, that if this process is repeated in a FOR NEXT loop the line may
appear to be plotted in slow motion due to the blanking effect. The following
program illustrates the problem (on a 4 Mhz Nascom&nbsp;2).
</p>
<p>
10 CLS : STARTAT 48,23 ; PENFLIP
20 FOR A=1 TO 400
30 DRAW 8,8 : PR: NEXT
</p>
<p>
Insert extra colons before the PENRET command to vary the timing and
observe the results.
</p>
<p>
PLOTTING ON THE SCREEN
</p>
<p>
Graphic co-ordinates have been changed slightly while using Nas-Graphpac.
&ldquo;Y&rdquo; co-ordinates 45, 46 and 47 no longer appear on the top
unscrolled line of the screen but are found in their correct positions
near the bottom of the screen. This should not affect existing software as
SET, RESET and POINT are unchanged and use the old graphics co-ordinates.
X,Y co-ordinates are still numbered in the usual way. co-ordinate 0,0 is found
in the top left hand corner and 95,47 is found in the bottom right
corner. An option is available whereby attempting to plot at X,Y co-ordinates
off of the screen will not cause an FC error. With this facility it is
quite possible to place the CAP at X,Y co-ordinates 200,23 and draw a circle
using the CIRCLE command with a radius of 175. Part of the circle will
appear on the screen. Arguments given to Nas-Graphpac commands must not exceed
32767 or BASIC will cause an FC error.
</p>
<p>
The location which has to be PEEKed after a PTEST command is executed
can be found the the ROM BASIC workspace at 4177 decimal (1051 hex).
