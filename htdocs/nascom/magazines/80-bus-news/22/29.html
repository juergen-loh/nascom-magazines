GRAPHPAC COMMAND MANUAL
</h2>
<h3>
Introduction.
</h3>
<p>
Graphpac allows the user to SET, RESET, INVERT or TEST any pixel on
the screen. Routines are also supplied to draw lines using rectangular (based
on X,Y values) or polar co-ordinates (described by an angle and distance).
This manual gives a general description of Graphpac features and commands in a
similar format and notation to Microsoft Mbasic documentation. An entry is
given for each command showing the syntax used.
</p>
<h3>
Plotting on the screen.
</h3>
<p>
The resolution of the graphics is determined by the hardware used and
can range from 96 pixels across the screen by 46 pixels down, to 512 X 256 or
more.
</p>
<p>
Graphpac commands control an invisible graphics cursor, the position
of this cursor is described by X,Y co-ordinates. Values supplied to Graphpac
are treated as signed 16-bit values between &ndash;32768 and +32767. A screen X coordinate
value of +32767 is the maximum distance to the right of the screen
that the graphics cursor may be placed. Negative values are to the left of the
screen, &ndash;32768 being the maximum. It is not necessary to use the INT function
before passing a value to Graphpac.
</p>
<p>
Note that if Graphpac is used with Microsoft Mbasic or BASIC-80,
numbers between +32768 and +65535 will be accepted. Graphpac will interpret
these values and all values in between as negative numbers between &ndash;32768 and
&ndash;1.
</p>
<p>
As a general rule numbers greater then 32767 should not be passed to
Graphpac.
</p>
<h3>
GRAPHPAC COMMANDS
</h3>
<p>
Not all the commands described in this document will be available in
the software supplied. Some would be unsuitable or impractical on your
particular hardware, in other cases they may just be unnecessary. The
documentation specific to your hardware (Graphpac System Manual) will inform
you which commands are available.
</p>
<p>
Graphpac commands are stored in memory usually as normal ASCII
characters and not as one byte tokens which represent normal BASIC reserved
words.
</p>
<p>
The PLOT DRAW and DRAWTO commands may have more than one set of values
passed at a time by separating each set with a semi colon.
</p>
<pre class="indent">
i.e.    10 DRAWTO 0,0 ; 20,0 ; 20,20 ; 0,20

will be no change.
