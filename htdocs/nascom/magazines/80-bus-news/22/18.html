wasn&rsquo;t interested in the idea, I kept getting funny totally uninformative error
messages. Anyway as the linker and LOAD both didn&rsquo;t want to know, and as I didn&rsquo;t
have the manual for the linker anyway, it was back to the instructions. These
woffled on about using DDT and reading in the .HEX file with an offset calculated
from the start address and the destination. Frankly it didn&rsquo;t make a lot of
sense, as it seemed to mean that DDT could take a HEX file, convert it to code
and stuff it in the right place. This sounded cleverer than the DDT I know and
hate, but as I hadn&rsquo;t read all the words about DDT &hellip; perhaps &hellip; you never
know. So I did it and it appeared to work. I examined the code at the start of
the CCP as now overlayed by CCPZ and it was certainly different, but did CCPZ
work? So save the file and SYSGEN onto the system tracks and find out!!

Now this is the natural cliff-hanger, where I should say this is the end
of part one and watch this space for future developments. Aren&rsquo;t you lucky this
isn&rsquo;t a serial, because of course it worked. I still don&rsquo;t know why, and if it
hadn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d have actually had to read ALL the documentation to find out why. (Have
you noticed I&rsquo;m a great believer in &ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t work try reading the
instructions&rdquo;.) Anyway it worked, and I proceeded to check all the functions.
There was one nice little tweek that Gemini have in their modded version on the
Winnie, and that was to do with the USER command. You could either type:
</p>
<pre>
A&gt;USER 13
</pre>
<p class="continued">
or
</p>
<pre>
A&gt;.13
</pre>
<p class="continued">
Now as . is three letters less than USER, this seemed a good idea. So back to the
source. It was easy enough to find the command jump table, so I added the extra
command &lsquo;.&rsquo; and reassembled it. Tuf, it now looked for the user number, the &lsquo;13&rsquo;,
in the wrong place. I could get away with:
</p>
<pre>
A&gt;.   13
</pre>
<p class="continued">
or even
</p>
<pre>
A&gt;   .13
</pre>
<p class="continued">
But of course the routine that actually got the user number wasn&rsquo;t bright enough
to look for it someplace else if you actually moved it. Oh well, back to the
source and find the routine, which, surprise surprise, was labelled GETNUM. At
that point I looked at the clock and noted that it was well passed the witching
hour and I was in imminent danger of turning into a pumpkin so I left it .....
and left it ..... and left it. One day I&rsquo;ll get round to it but honestly, is it
worth the bother I ask myself, and of course this is the way it will stay until
the day when I have to change the user number 99999 times in one evening, THEN
I&rsquo;LL FIX THE B....RI!!

<span class="uppercase">A Change Of Tactics</span>

<p>
At long last, and about time too, the bit about the change of operating
methods that this all brought about. Now I have lots of software, some purchased,
odd bits stolen, some borrowed, a little &lsquo;liberated&rsquo; and enough of my own to
cause me considerable grief when trying to find what I&rsquo;m looking for. Have you
noticed that a lot of proprietary software often has a file called <span class="uppercase">Install</span>, so if
you are trying to keep things together, it&rsquo;s a bit daft to put two suites of
programs on one disk without renaming the <span class="uppercase">Install</span> program of at least one of
them. Now consider the case where 788K is available on one disk, this problem is
not going to apply to just a couple of suites of programs, more like half a
dozen. How to keep them separate? The simplistic answer is to use different user
areas for each. Fine, but how to find them.
</p>
<p>
A long time ago I came across the cataloguing suite by Ward Christennsen
in the CP/M users library and to date this has proved ideal, although I took it
apart a long time ago because I didn&rsquo;t like some of its &lsquo;features&rsquo;. Richard also
had a go at it soon after. Well of course, this couldn&rsquo;t keep track of things on
different user areas, but one Sunday evening soon fixed that. Now CATUD can be
called from any user area, CCPZ will of course find it where I left it, having
loaded CATUD, CCPZ will switch back to the original user area and then execute
the program. CATUD then constructs the names list for possible insertion into the
