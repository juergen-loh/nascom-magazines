has a good approach to programming, in that he recommends that you build up a
library of macros, rather than re-invent the wheel each time you need a
particular routine, and he supplies the code for the actual macros. He shows
how to read and write disk files from machine code programs, and gives a good
explanation of how the directory works, which is something most authors avoid
like the plague. There are several appendices, mostly useful, and a good index
too. So, what is the catch? Well, remember that the professor has been using
CP/M for a long time? He started out with the <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> processor, and all the
example programs and macros are in those funny mnemonics that we modern Z80
fans can&rsquo;t stand. You could use the indices to translate from one to the
other, if you wanted to: if you have the assembler he recommends (the grossly,
absurdly over-priced Macro&nbsp;80), it will accept either sort of mnemonics. Even
with this disadvantage, this is still the best book on CP/M that I have seen
so far. I was preparing a series of articles about using CP/M routines in your
own machine code programs, but I won&rsquo;t bother.....

<u>BOOK REVIEW 2</u> &ndash; THE SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE
</h3>
<p>
This one is on sale at W H Smiths, if you can get past the hordes of children
fingering all the computer magazines they stock (about 500, from the look of
things), reading the blurbs on all those garish cassette cases under the
S*ncl**r Sp*ctr*m (which is busy demonstrating itself to an audience of
baffled shoppers, most of whom seem to think it is Channel 4 television they
are watching). It is actually in the shelf with the top ten paperback books of
the moment, and costs a mere &pound;1.95, which is a nice change from computer book
prices in general. It is a description of how a firm called Data General
rushed out their 32 bit machine in an impossibly short time. The reviews I had
read about this book made it sound as if they burned out the brains and bodies
of hundreds of their staff in the process, but having read it, I think they
had it pretty cushy. Only one bloke actually left, and he stayed in the
business, in spite of the note he left, saying he refused to deal in any unit
of time shorter than a season. The engineers in particular seem to have lived
a life of comparative luxury. Did you ever hear of a logic analyser being used
on a Nascom
<?php externalLink("RAM&nbsp;A"); ?>
board? They don&rsquo;t know they are born, as the saying goes.
Mind you, I found it a good read. There are rude words in it, but only one, in
various forms, since American swearing seems pretty monotonous and is rather
unimaginative. Nobody says swut, turlingdrome, or (heaven forbid) Belgium!
Almost forgot, it&rsquo;s by Tracy Kidder, and has a p-picture of a P-Penguin on it.

<u>VIRTUAL DISK TESTED</u>
</h3>
<p>
I said I would do some sort of benchmark program to find out what sort of
difference using virtual disks makes to the speed things run at. True to form,
I have not yet done things, but I have an estimate. Loading the 32K of an
Adventure game from disk takes about 8 seconds on my system, although I
believe some of the more recent drives than my Pertec will do it faster.
Loading the same 32K from virtual disk takes under half a second. It should be
pretty obvious from this that any program that does updates of files on disk
will speed up in a dramatic way, so I tried out a program called Marvin. Hey
Presto! The main bottleneck, or one of them any way, disappeared, as the file
update went through in about two seconds. Even the accompanying Zap program
goes acceptably fast, when run from the virtual drive.

<h3>
<u>PLUTO UPGRADE ROM</u>
</h3>
<p>
As if the facilities provided by the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
were not sufficiently incredible,
there is an upgrade ROM available, which adds some extra commands to those
already available. It costs &pound;60.00, however, which is pretty steep for an
EPROM and a revised manual. The manual is a distinct improvement on the
earlier one, thank goodness. However, for people like me, it would have been a
good idea if they had said where the new ROM goes. Do not put it in the nice
empty socket, because that is not where it goes. Take out the old <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> ROM,
and put the new <?php externalLink("2764"); ?> in that socket, with the new chip&rsquo;s pin 1 in the hole
