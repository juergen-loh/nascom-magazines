I would also like to correct the impression that a Biphase signal
contains only frequencies between half the Baud rate and the Baud
rate itself. By chance I had been experimenting with FFT&rsquo;s (Fast
Fourier Transforms) and had calculated spectra for NRI. Biphase and
Biphase-M encoded random data streams shortly before the arrival of
<a href="../../../13/01/text/#page">issue&nbsp;3</a>.
These show that in fact the spectra of both Biphase signals
reach a peak at the Baud rate, and have minima at 0 frequency (ie DC)
and twice the Baud rate. NRZ on the other hand has a minimum at the
Baud rate but is not DC free and so cannot be used for taping data.
This is not to say however that Biphase data cannot be recovered
after passing it through a bandpass filter such as a tape recorder.
(My FFT program is written in <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Tape Pascal 4, and takes about
30 seconds to calculate a 512 point spectrum.)

Can it be that I am the only reader of 80-bus News to realise that
the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>&rsquo;s RDY and /STB lines are ideally suited to handshaking with
the printer&rsquo;s /STROBE and /ACKNLG lines? All that is required is the
addition of an LS TTL inverter:

The port must be in mode 0 (output). Busy should still be taken back
to an input line on the other port to allow the driver software to
monitor the printer status, unless that is you drive the printer on
interrupt. My printer is at the end of 3m of ribbon cable, but I have
had no problem with spurious signals oar the lack of a program
determined settling time.
