<u>The Bad News</u>
</h3>
<p>
It had to happen, didn&rsquo;t it? I open my big mouth (in the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue) and
confidently state that as we had actually managed to produce several
consecutive issues reasonably on time, the trend would continue. And what
happens? A conspiracy, that&rsquo;s what, the net result of which is that this will
probably now reach you approx. 6 weeks late (if not later).

<h3>
<u>The Good News</u>
</h3>
<p>
One consolation (as a result of this conspiracy) is that I have already
managed to get a considerable amount of material together for the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue,
and all things being equal (which they rarely are) it should follow this in a
matter of days.

<u>More Bad News</u>

In the Editorial of the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue I stated that I was trying to get
together information on the I/O ports used by 80-BUS/Nasbus compatible boards.
The purpose of this is to draw up an I/O map of all boards past/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>present and
(individual manufacturers allowing) future so that everyone can see what
product clashes with what (which some unfortunately do), and what space is
available to locate that 256 channel, polyphonic, quadrophonic noise-maker
that you are currently building. I gave all of the manufacturers that I am
aware of several weeks and at least <b>TWO</b> reminders to give me the necessary
information, and still I have not received all of the information I requested.
So to <b>Climax, EV Computing, Gemini Microcomputers, MAP 80 Systems</b> and
<b>Microcode Processes</b> many thanks for your time and effort in returning the
requested information to me so promptly and so completely. And as for the
others, that is <b>Lucas/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom</b> and <b>IO Research &ndash; RASPBERRIES&nbsp;!!!</b> As a result of
this apathy I am going to hold the I/O map over to the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue ... so this
is your last chance Nascom and I/O. If you don&rsquo;t send me the details that
are, after all, in your own interest (of selling product) to have published
correctly, I shall &lsquo;interpret&rsquo; the ports used myself, and suggest that EVERY
80-BUS reader sends you a personal letter asking to verify that we got it
right. OK?

I am pleased to report that CCsoft have very gratiously given us their
permission to publish the code for their Nas-Graphpac package. This links
with the standard Nascom ROM BASIC to provide twenty additional commands for
controlling the Nascom&rsquo;s 96x48 block graphics. In addition they have allowed
us to reprint the System manual for the package, and Gemini (who have bought
the rights to CCsoft&rsquo;s other Graphpacs) have also given us permission to
reprint the Command manual. This means that we are able to bring you totally
free, gratis and for nothing software which normally retails (on cassette) for
&pound;20 + VAT. All you have to do is type it all in!
</p>
<h3>
<u>Even More Good News</u>
</h3>
<p>
Last <a href="../text/"></a>issue (I think) we included an advert for a book on &lsquo;Nascom BASIC
disassembled&rsquo; that said something to the effect of &lsquo;coming soon&rsquo;. Well the
publication of that has slipped too, and so we have decided, in our extremely
infinite wisdom, to &lsquo;serialize&rsquo; it starting in the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue. This is a
series that Gemini and Nascom owners alike should find of interest, as the
listing is extremely thoroughly commented and should give the 80-BUS reader
interested in machine code programming (all one of him) a great insight into
many programming tricks that keep code as short and fast as possible.
