master catalogue in RAM. At that point I added a routine to save the original
drive and user numbers and then do a hierarchical search similar to CCP4Z for the
master catalogue. The same as CCPZ with the exception that it always ends it
search for the file at drive A: USER O as it was too much like hard work to make
the thing search CCPZ for the final DFU number (and what about if CCPZ wasn&rsquo;t
there anyway, it could do all sorts of wierd and wonderful things). Having found
the master catalogue, this is updated from the names list. CATUD then restores
the original drive and user and then goes home. I[ didn&rsquo;t need to update the
catalogue search program CAT as I reckon that it will naturally be on the same
</p>
<p>
drive/user as the master catalogue.
</p>
<p>
Of late GEMPEN/DISKPEN has being undergoing a face lift with the addition
of lots of new features, two of which involve looking for overlay files, the
master HELP overlay and the master MENU overlay, a quick word with Peter and PEN
grew the hierarchical search as well.
</p>
<p>
So having found a way of cataloguing the software on various user areas,
how to get it there? Even when using CCPZ, PIP is only capable of PIPing software
from one drive to another with the same user number, so that&rsquo;s not a lot of use.
[Ed. &ndash; wrong, Wrong, WRONG. If you actually READ the doc. that came with the
GM835 Winnie that you have at work you will find it refers you to the &lsquo;G&rsquo; option
of PIP. Now go and read up on PIP at once!!] The answer came with SWEEP, another
find from the CP/M User Group library. This is an all laughing dancing utility
which not only allows movement from one user area to another (even on the same
disk) but allows you to tag a load of files (and of course not tag others) for
bulk movement or bulk erase. It also has the ability to rename files and a sneeky
command for allowing you to &lsquo;TYPE&rsquo; ASCII files to the screen to find out if it is
the one you wanted. All clever stuff. I think it was written in some high level
compiling language because of its size, 26K, but even so it earns its keep.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, having gained the disk capacity, implemented a means of ready
access, fixed up a means of cataloging the files and got a means of putting the
files where I wanted them, comes the way of organising then. The cataloging suite
requires you to give the disk a name, and with my mod, the user areas on the disk
can all be given different names. So let&rsquo;s say I want to sort out a disk full of
source files into different groups. Now my disks live in books of 20 plastic
wallets made for the job, a bit pricey at about &pound;13.00 each, but ideal. Anyway,
for sake of argument, the disk we are to play with is disk number 6. So I decide
the CCPZ source suite with its&nbsp;.DOC files will live on USER 0, so I SWEEP them
across and give that user area the name -CCPZASM.O60. The next lot is the suite
of&nbsp;.MAC files for taking the cataloging suite apart and putting it back together
again. These are &lsquo;SWEPT&rsquo; across to USER 1 and given the name -CATMAC.061. Next
comes a suite of&nbsp;.MAC files about the RTC, a couple of mine, and Richards lot,
these go on USER 2 and are called -RTCMAC.O062. --- And so on --- Notice that the
file type starts with&nbsp;.06, meaning disk 6, and the last number is the user area
used for the particular suite. So when I ask CAT where the devil did I put the
file called TIME.MAC the reply:
</p>
<p>
File Disk
TIME.MAC RTCMAC.062
immediately tells me that the file is on disk 6, USER 2, get the idea?
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s all very simple, and of course entirely unoriginal, but it&rsquo;s
surprising those I&rsquo;ve mentioned it to have all seemed very impressed, hence the
preceding 34K of file describing the system and how I use it.
</p>
<p>
Now for the commercial, the utilities I&rsquo;ve mentioned are advertised
someplace in this magazine and CCPZ is available from the same source for a
tenner + VAT (state disk format when ordering). Of course the suppliers aren&rsquo;t
going to accept responsibility if you muck up your CP/M master disk, that&rsquo;s your
problem and serve you right for doing it on the master disk. Also, if you intend
to have a go at fitting CCPZ you&rsquo;ll have to find your own copy of DRI MAC.
</p>
<p>
Overall CCPZ is well worth it and a well designed piece of software.
