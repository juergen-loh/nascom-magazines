Il was interested in W Van Malderen*s article in Val.1l Iesue.3: it
_omfirmed what I had thought for some time, that with appropriate
ci cuitry data rates significantly higher than Nascom&rsquo;s standard 1200
and 2400 Baud are possible.

<p>
I would like toa point out a possible problem with the Biphase
(Manchester II) coding used, namely that the recorded data for a
stream of ones and a stream of zeros are ambiguous, as the following
sketch shows.

Thus. when the tape is replayed, the &ldquo;blank? sectian before the data
starts can be decoded randomly as mark or space, and in the latter
case the first data character will be missed. This does not matter
for tapes recorded in Nas-Sys format as a block of mulls is autput
before the data, and these will guarantee synchronisation af the
decoder. For other file structures (eg Hisoft Fascal 47) reliable
data recovery will not be achieved.
</p>
<p>
There is a related Biphase coding method, Biphase-M, which does not
suffer from this deficiency, and is also unaffected by possible
signal inversion in the recorder. tl refer you to an article in the
Feb i968? issue of Wireless World for a discussion of this coding
method along with circuits for coder and decoder. Apart fram the
addition of a phase-locked loop for clock recovery, these are aniy a
little more camplex than W Van Malderen*s circuit. T intend tea
experiment with this when time permits.
</p>

The article in Wireless Worid also points aut the desirability of
phase equilisatian of the signal oan playback for reliable operation.
Based om the Wireless World circiut I have built an equiliser which I
have installed permanently between the ouput of my portable recorder
and Nascom. The result has been a great improvement in the
reliability of reading data tapes, particularly for tapes recorded on
other machines. Most significantly, error free reading can naw
be achieved over a very wide range of volume control settings. The
circuit is powered from the 12V supply available on the serial
