Sl:-Is the main timing contact and is found on the left hand side of the unit,
There are two set&rsquo;s by the timing wheel and it&rsquo;s the inner set,
</p>
<p>
S2:-Is the space and back-space contact,it&rsquo;s situated at the rear of the unit,
second set from the right,
</p>
<p>
$3:-Carriage return and line feed contact, rear of the unit, extreme right,

<p>

Note that all magnet&rsquo;s must have a diode across them for two reason&rsquo;s,
</p>
<p>
1/, To protect the driver transistor&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
2/, To make the magnet&rsquo;s release as quickly as possible,
</p>
<p>
The 5 volt supply for the 74LS00 was provided by the PIO socket on the
</p>
<p>
NASCOM, so that if a 12 core screened cable is used (i,e, screen = Ov),
</p>
<p>
there will be ONE spare way,
</p>
<p>
The print magnet&rsquo;s, Rl through CK, are underneath on the left, and from
left to right are:--
</p>
<p>
T2 CK Ti R2A Rl R2 R5
</p>
<p>
As for the control magnet&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of applying power to
</p>
<p>
each one in turn and noting the effect, They are situated on the right hand
side, underneath,
