<p>
Note that all magnet&rsquo;s must have a diode across them for two reason&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
1/. To protect the driver transistor&rsquo;s.<br>
2/. To make the magnet&rsquo;s release as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
The 5 volt supply for the 74LS00 was provided by the PIO socket on the
NASCOM, so that if a 12 core screened cable is used (i.e. screen = Ov),
there will be ONE spare way.

<p>
The print magnet&rsquo;s, R1 through CK, are underneath on the left, and from
left to right are:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
T2 &nbsp; CK &nbsp; T1 &nbsp; R2A &nbsp; R1 &nbsp; R2 &nbsp; R5
</p>
<p>
As for the control magnet&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of applying power to
each one in turn and noting the effect. They are situated on the right hand
side, underneath.
