The time had come when hard copy was an absolute necessity, but how did one
obtain (other than beg, borrow or steal), a mechanical marvel of reasonable
quality? A CREED was ruled out since I could not afford any structural
alteration&rsquo;s like joist support&rsquo;s or double glazing.<br>
(I almost bought a QUME daisywheel but they didn&rsquo;t have the right colour).<br>
Think&rsquo;s.....try the WATER board, GAS board, ELECTRICITY board, GPO even.<br>
WATER board:&ndash; Well er...I don&rsquo;t er... we&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;one&rsquo; but when it goes wrong
we buy another.<br>
GAS board:-YES, IBM magnetic tape typewriter&rsquo;s, (GOLFBALL&rsquo;S to you).<br>
Will you be making any redundant in the near future? YES, come over and have a
look at one.<br>
I was there like a shot and came face to face with an IBM MT-typewriter.<br>
I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t just sell the printer you would have to take the whole
system. This dampened my enthusiasm because the &lsquo;whole&rsquo; system looked
completely un-affordable, (have you ever seen an IBM MT-typewriter?).<br>
It consist&rsquo;s of a &lsquo;metal&rsquo; three draw desk with the printer on top, and alongside
that is a rather large tape control unit. The latter, (by the way), just fit&rsquo;s
into the boot of a MARINA.<br>
Anyway, to cut a long story short, I managed to acquire this highly sought after
piece of equipment for a princely &pound;50.

*** Now to drive it. ***
</h4>
<p>
I eventually intend to drive the printer from an RS232 serial port using an 8035
micro. This will be programmed to recieve RS232 output at whatever speed is
selected by link&rsquo;s on the RS232 input socket. (If you are not familiar with
the 8035/48/51 series micro, perhaps an article would be of interest, it&rsquo;s an
ideal control micro?).

For the time being, however, I wanted hard copy, so decided to use a PIO.
There are 7, 48 volt print magnet&rsquo;s on an IBM called R1 R2 R2A R5 T1 T2 CK.
I&rsquo;ve wired these via, drivers to port 5 bit&rsquo;s 0 to 6 respectively.
There are also a few control magnet&rsquo;s, I have used CRLF TAB SP LC UC connected
to bit&rsquo;s 2 to 6 respectively of the same port.
A glance at the circuit will show that bit 7 is used to select either print
magnet&rsquo;s or control magnet&rsquo;s. This was done so that a 12 core cable could be
used between the computer and printer.
</p>
<p>
Two other signal&rsquo;s are required, a BUSY line and a SHIFT line. These are
produced as shown in the circuit. When the printer is ready, BUSY=1.
The SHIFT line is used to identify which case the printer is in, and also serves
to &lsquo;time&rsquo; the case change. Port 4 bit 0 is used for SHIFT, and bit 1 for BUSY.
</p>
<p>
The mechanical timing of an IBM is fairly complicated, so to get a
correct BUSY line signal, the feedback contact&rsquo;s must be connected in the
correct sequence as shown.
</p>
<p>
The contact&rsquo;s work on the following principle:&ndash;<br>
When the IBM is ready, the N/C contact&rsquo;s are used to set BUSY high.<br>
A character is sent.<br>
When the N/O contact&rsquo;s have closed, the magnet&rsquo;s may be de-energised.
And when the N/C contact&rsquo;s have re-closed the IBM is ready for another character.
