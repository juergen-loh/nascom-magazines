With the permission of the Editor, I would like to apologise to the
enraged readers of the 80-Bus News for the absence of any book reviews in 80-Bus
No. 3. This was due in part to other demands on my time (my surgeon won&rsquo;t allow
me bring my Computer into hospital with me&nbsp;&ndash; I think it makes him feel insecure)
and also to the fact that I found very few books worth buying and reading. It is
not generally known, but most, if not all, of the reviews published in 80-Bus
News are based on items purchased by the reviewer using real money. The idea that
we sit around all day unwrapping parcels of items sent to us free, gratis, and
for nothing for review is a gross misconception in general. If some kind
manufacturer wishes to send me a dual floppy disk set up for review and extended
test, I will be happy to facilitate him, as my car is currently running around on
my dual floppy disk funds, they having been requisitioned to rebuild its
automatic transmission. Did you know that early models of the Volvo 343 suffer
from a design fault in the bobweights, resulting in catastrophic failure of the
transmision every 10&nbsp;&ndash; 20 thousand miles? I found this out the hard way! I&rsquo;m glad
to say that, having spared no expense, the transmission is now rebuilt, using the
new improved parts, and should be good for many hundreds of thousands of miles.
Anyone like to buy a slightly used Volvo 343?&hellip;

Enough of the bulletin from the battlefront. Bring on the books! As I
said, of recent months there has been little published that interested me. This
may be due in part to the fact that Dublin is very nearly a computer desert. One
book I found was:

<table class="book-review">
<tr><td>Microcomputer Technology by Prof. Julian R Ullman,</td></tr>
<tr><td>published by Pitman at about &pound;5</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This book is an introductory survey to microcomputers and their use. Its specific
chip is the Z80, and it deals with the programming of the Z80, the types of data
structures one meets in computing, the use of high level languages, and a fair
whack of logic design. The most interesting section is the last chapter, where he
uses Pascal to show how a Z80 assembler might be written.

<table class="book-review">
<tr><td>Microcomputer-based Design by J.B.Peatman,</td></tr>
<tr><td>published by McGraw Hill (student edition about &pound;7.50)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is in many ways a similar book to the foregoing. Published in 1977, its
emphasis is a little oriented towards the <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> and other older machines.
Nevertheless, it does have appendices on the Z80 and 6809. It also gives a fairly
good overview of the problems of interfacing from chip to chip, and suggested
circuits for voltage level shifting.

<table class="book-review">
<tr><td>An Introduction to Database Systems by C.J.Date,</td></tr>
<tr><td>published Addison Wesley</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Is a substantial work reviewing the differing techniques used in data base
programming. I&rsquo;ve read it once, and have put it aside for a rest before reading
it again, to give its contents time to be assimilated. I&rsquo;m interested in the
problems of data base management as I intend to write a simple Database
Management System for a particular application.

<table class="book-review">
<tr><td>The Art Of Computer Programming</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vol 1: Fundamental Algorithms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vol 2: Seminumerical Algorithms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vol 3: Searching and Sorting</td></tr>
<tr><td>by D. Knuth, published Addison Wesley</td></tr>

<p>
These books form the Bible of computer studies. There is a rule&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s in
Knuth then its right&rdquo;. They are not light reading. Usually about 20 minutes is
all you can take, and the rest of the day is spent assimilating what you have
