In this, the LSB 4 bits of 0111 indicate Interrupt Control Word. Bits 4 to 6 are
only used in Mode 3, and Bit 7 enables or disables the Port to interrupt. If Bit
7 = 1, then Interrupts are enabled. If 0, then disabled. If an interrupt
condition occurs while disabled, the PIO latches it, and interrupts as soon as
Port interrupts are re-enabled. If we don&rsquo;t want this to happen, then we can set
Bit 4 in the Interrupt Control Word to reset the pending interrupt condition.
Bits 4 &ndash; 6 are used in Mode 3. If Bit 6 = 1, then selected lines are monitored
for AND condition, i.e. they must all be active for interrupts. If bit 7 = 0,
then any one of them can be active and cause an interrupt. Bit 5 =1 indicates
that they should be monitored for High level, = 0 for low level. Bit 4 = 1
indicates that the next word sent to the port must define a mask. Only those
lines whose mask bit is O will be monitored for generating an interrupt. To
enable or disable a Port interrupt without modifying the rest of the Interrupt
Control Word, we write the following word to the port.

Problems have occurred with the PIO&rsquo;s little peculiarities. Disabling interrupts
by writing the above control word to the port is subject to them. For example,
you write the disable control word to the port. As you do so, an interrupt
occurs. The PIO generates an interrupt, and the CPU acknowledges it. By then, the
PIO has deciphered the control word and deactivated the interrupt structure. In
consequence, the PIO will not place the interrupt vector on the bus at the
appropriate time. The CPU will read such a vector, however. As the bus lines are
not in a well defined state, this value will be spurious, giving rise to
eccentric behaviour of the interrupt structure. The cure for this is to disable
CPU interrupts, send the disable control word, and reenable the CPU interrupts.
Here is the sequence of instructions:
</p>
<p>
LD A,03H ;Disable word
DI sDisable CPU
OUT (PIO),A sDisable PIO
EI :Enable CPU
</p>
<p>
This causes the CPU to ignore any such spurious interrupts while the PIO is
turning its own interrupt structure off.

So much for the actual instructions for setting up the interrupts in the
PTO. Now we have to consider what the Interrupt handling routine is to do.
Obviously, without knowing the precise form of your peripheral, this is something
I can&rsquo;t deal with in particular, but there are a few points to draw to your
attention. First of all, an interrupt automatically disables any further
interrupts &ndash; not just from the same device, but over the whole Machine, except
for the NMI. It is at your discretion when to reenable them. This action will
allow higher priority devices to interrupt the service routine currently running.
As a rough rule of thumb, timer and floppy disk interrupts are usually accorded
higher priority than simple input/output devices. So, suppose your parallel
printer is connected up to a port, and interrupts for more data. Usually a
printer has a buffer within it, and a print rate of 60 &ndash; 120 chars per sec. So
long as the printer has about 100 chars in its buffer, it won&rsquo;t need any further
attention for about a second. This means that we could, for example, allow our
cTc to interrupt the printer routine every half second or so with the time. We
can only interrupt a routine when it is in a safe state, so we need to have saved
any data resulting from the interrupt before permitting another. Reenabling
interrupts is done by executing the EI instruction within the interrupt service
routine. To lock after the problem of signalling to the lower priority device
that the higher priority device that has interrupted it is finished, and that the
lower priority unit can now continue with its interrupt service, we have to
terminate each interrupt service routine with EI (enable interrupts) if we have
not already used it, and a RETI (RETurn from Interrupt). The EI is not acted upon
