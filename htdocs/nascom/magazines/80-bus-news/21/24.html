<p>disk as it contains a certain ammount of initialized data). So there are now app.
400H bytes (1K) of RAM free above SYS. The two Buffers take 280H bytes so
another 180H (384 decimal) bytes of code could be added without pushing the
Buffers off the top end of RAM. I understand that a new SYS with support for the
excellent MAP80 256K RAM card and a number of other extra new features might be
available soon. I use one of the MAP RAM Cards as a Virtual Disk and it certainly
speeds things up a bit but I miss the extra features of SYS in the support CBIOS.

<p>
The disk with CPM64.COM on its System track can now be put to use. Boot it up and
then &lsquo;RUN UP&rsquo; the modified SYS which will self locate over the OLDBIOS. (from
0EE00H in this case). Then use a BUG program to load a saved copy of CPM64.COM
into low memory. (e.g. ZSID CPM64.COM (CR).) Remembering the addresses noted
earlier, copy the active &lsquo;SYS&rsquo; from CP/M in high memory over the old CBIOS
starting at 2100H. Since 4K is the maximum ammount that can be added, move 4K
down to make it easy. (e.g. MEE00,FE00,2100 (CR).) will copy it down. Use the &lsquo;D&rsquo;
command to check at 2100H to see that data has changed and is the same as the
data at EE00H. This new CP/M can now be saved. For tidyness though, I first
filled from the end of the workspace to the highest possible end of the CBIOS
with 00&rsquo;s using the &lsquo;F&rsquo; command. This makes it easier to see the end of the code
section when using a PEEK program.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to enter G0 (CR) followed by SAVE 48 CPMSYS64.COM. Note the
changes. The name has been changed to denote the fixed size and the embedded
&lsquo;SYS&rsquo; function. The ammount to be saved has increased from 43 to 48 Pages. The
CBIOS started at 2100H and was 4K long (max) so the top address possible is
3100H. It is thus necessary to save memory from 100H to 3100H which is 48 &ndash; 256
byte pages. As previously noted SYSGEN will put memory from 900H upwards onto
disk, but the area 100H &ndash; 8FFH must be preserved to be compatible with SYSGEN.
</p>
<p>
In theory if we put this file on the System Track of a disk and boot, the job
should be done, since all addresses should be correct, and there is enough room
on the disk. So a SYSGEN CPMSYS64.COM (CR) command is issued and the new system
placed on the disk. Then RESET is pressed to try it. DISASTER&nbsp;!! &ndash; IT DOES NOT
WORK.
</p>
<p>
At this stage, I tried a PEEK on the System Track. The BIOS all seemed to be
there, with code and workspace area ending within a few bytes of the top of
sector 19. That last sector, number 20 though &ndash; it should have been all 00&rsquo;s as
the top of the BIOS was filled with 00&rsquo;s before saving it.But here I found F5&rsquo;s
which is the pattern written to disk during formating so for some reason the
whole of the CPMSYS64.COM file is not being written to disk. This last sector is
not needed at the moment as all of the CBIOS was present on previous sectors, but
I could want it with a new larger &lsquo;SYS&rsquo;, so why was it not written. To solve this
one I disassembled SYSGEN. Luckily this is a short Program of about 1K, with a
lot of ASCII text in it, so the task was not too bad. It did not take very long
so find out that it was the sector counting routine that was responsible for the
problem. It was Programmed to only put 19 Sectors to disk. The count only needed
to be &lsquo;upped&rsquo; by one to get all 20 sectors actioned. Locations 01BAH/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>01BBH in
my copy were 38 14H. (LD A,14H). I used my BUG program to set this to 15H, and
saved the altered program as SYSGEN1.COM. The revised program now Reads and
Writes the whole system track.
</p>
<p>
The SYSGEN mod. did not solve the problem though. I needed to see what was
getting into RAM. I put the disk back into drive A and RESET. After a few
seconds, I removed the disk, RESET again and used SIMON to explore memory. The
bottom of RAM contained the COLD BOOT, unaltered, so CP/M had obviously not got
going. If it had, the jump vectors and IOBYTE at the low end of the memory would
have been visible. So I checked high RAM. It soon became apparent that the CBIOS
was missing from FA00H up. This meant that for some reason two whole sectors had
not been loaded from the system track to the BIOS RAM. Since the vital sector
