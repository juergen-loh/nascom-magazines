Program One, as it is entitled has one or two points to be noted:
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis">
<li>The quotes must be included in the DATA statements.</li>
<li>Leave a space between the the quotes and the first word of the statement. (Try
	without and see what happens.)</li>
<li>The variable on line 40 must change with the number of DATA statements. (e.g.
	with seven DATA statements, line 40 would be FOR I=1 TO 7)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Program Two highlights the neat INKEY$ routine in the
<a href="../../../12/45/text/#article1">Extension Basic reviewed</a>
in 80BUS News; it displays the decimal equivalent of the ASCII code of
any key pressed, including graphics.

The next one is easy, from David Hicks at Girton College, Cambridge. He
wants to know what the &lsquo;well published&rsquo; mod for converting the Nascom&nbsp;2 screen to
16 TV lines is, as it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been published in anything he has
read. Well, there are two answers, the first is simple and crude but works, and
that is to whip pin X of ICYY out of its socket. [Ed. &ndash; Really useful Dave!! I
think X=1, YY=53.] The second solution was complicated and as I have forgotten
where I read it, I&rsquo;ll gloss over it. [Ed. &ndash; chicken!]

D. W. Edgar of Greenock, Renfrewshire, has noted that people always seem
to be moaning in various magazines about the tape loading of virtually all home
computers. He recommends the Binatone Piper Mini Cassette recorder as providing
100% reliability with his Nascom. As the Binatone is only priced at &pound;15.99, it
should appeal to all Scotsmen. Personally, I have used a wide variety of cassette
recorders over a period of years and have found it difficult to fault any of
them. The cheapest was a Pye Mains/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>battery model that cost &pound;12.95, The most
expensive (and noticeably the least mechanically reliable) was a Tandy CTR80 at
about &pound;40.00. The Pye is still in daily use in the shop after two and a half
years, the Tandy was consigned to the bin about a year ago after spending months
back at Tandy&rsquo;s under warranty. The Tandy worked all right, it was simply that
bits kept falling off it. In any event, almost without exception, all tape
recorders we have tried have produced as near to 100% reliability as it is
practical to achieve. The tape used, ah, now that&rsquo;s a different matter. In the
situation that we ere in, we have tried most makes of tape and have noted that
&lsquo;el cheapo&rsquo; tape is no good at all. We also noted that certain tape recorders
were fussy about certain brands of tape. The one shining example which would go
with almost any tape recorder was TDK D46 or D60, followed closely by Scotch
computer tapes. Some of the special computer grade C10&rsquo;s we purchased were
useless. So I endorse Mr Treen&rsquo;s recommendation and use TDK.

Bill Ratcliffe wants to know if there are any books on programming
techniques for the Microsoft Basic as he says, &ldquo;My program organisation is
chaotically out of control and I need help&rdquo;. Well this one is a lot harder to
answer, as sorting programs into a sensible order is a cross between discipline
and sensible forward planning, both topics I am the last person to ask about.
Most of my Basic programs end up as one hell of a mess, and the only person who
understands them is myself (and then only for a short while after I&rsquo;ve written
them). What I do is to write the program and make it work. Then, if it&rsquo;s for
publication I decide what it was I set out to achieve, and jot down the order of
the main routines. Then an ASCII dump of the Basic program is put back into my
<span class="uppercase">Diskpen</span> and a &lsquo;scissors and paste job&rsquo; performed, pulling all the common bits
together and commenting them. The whole lot is then renumbered using the &lsquo;find
and change command&rsquo; starting from the top. A very messy process of program
writing, and not to be encouraged. Perhaps we should follow Dr Dark&rsquo;s and Rory&rsquo;s
exhortations and both learn Pascal.
