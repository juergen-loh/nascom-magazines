The first letter on the pile is from M. L. Trim, of Garswood, Ashton in
Makerfield, Merseyside.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
This is a program written for use with the Gemini G805 disk system. It
was an exercise to help me understand data storage on disk and has proved quite
useful in storing my customers&rsquo; addresses and phone numbers. However, other
instructions could be inserted to suit the requirement, for example, a Christmas
card list, general address list, etc.

<p class="indent">
Line 100 sets up the Nascom array size<br>
lines 110 &ndash; 150 is an INKEYS routine
</p>
<p>
The program speaks for itself being a batch of small routines which can
be located in line 840.
</p>
<p>
Your faithfully, M. L. Trim.
</p>
<p>
As Mr Trim&rsquo;s listing was supplied as hard copy, I had to type it in and
in the process I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to have a small go at it. I
changed the input routines and the print routines into two subroutines. As this
was written for a version of Basic I couldn&rsquo;t identify, and therefore couldn&rsquo;t
get my hands on, I haven&rsquo;t tried it. So I hope I haven&rsquo;t mucked it about to the
extent that it does not work.
</p>
<p>
Next off the pile comes a letter from R.A.C. Treen of Burgess Hill. Some
time ago he wrote to me about networks for Nascom owners. This is something that
could be interesting and Malcolm Alberry of Leighton Buzzard keeps muttering to
me about an automatic disk based bulletin board using his Nascom and 8&Prime; drives. I
don&rsquo;t know how far Malcolm has persued this, but such a scheme would be very
practical for both disk based and non disk computers. The main trouble is modems
for the &rsquo;phone lines. Two or three simple designs costing up to &pound;30.00 have been
published, but as far as I know no-one has looked into these. I wonder if anyone
has played about with modems, and if so could they let us know. Mr. Treen is also
interested in exchanging tapes, so if anyone is interested perhaps they could
drop us a line and we will forward them to Mr. Treen. [Ed. &ndash; Perhaps Mr. Treen
could communicate with Dr. Dark; see his pages for details.] Mr. Treen continues
his letter with a thorough endorsement of the Level Nine Adventure program:
</p>
<p>
.... On a completely different subject, I purchased, from Level 9, a copy
of the 32K Colossal Aventure recently. (I have a Nascom&nbsp;2 under NAS-SYS 3 with
32K of user RAM.) My first impressions were that it was superb. The progam comes
on a TDK D46 cassette (I have had ZERO TAPE ERRORS with this brand, YES, ZERO).
The program is recorded at 1200 BAUD twice on side A and once at 300 BAUD on side
B. The program loaded first time. With the program is an eight page A5 booklet.
This contains the scenario for, and explicit and concise instructions on, playing
the game. Included in the game is a stamped addressed envelope for you to request
your free clue [a novel way of ensuring program registration &ndash; DH].
</p>
<p>
The game itself is the standard mainframe adventure with of course some
modifications. The end game (which I have not yet reached) is supposed to contain
70 rooms instead of the usual 2. I have been playing the game for about 15 hours
in all and my highest score is still only 165 out of a possible 1100. If you
liked the mainframe adventure then you&rsquo;ll like this. If you haven&rsquo;t played
Adventure, then I suggest you do. See the ads in the April &ndash; June 80BUS News, I
consider it well worth the money.
</p>

P.S. Does anyone know how to open the clam ............

Yours sincerely, R.A.C. Treen
</p>
<p>
And, so on to Robert Wood of Cardiff who has sent two small and simple
routines:
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
Readers might like to try the little routine listed below, which could be
called &lsquo;Nascom Advertising Display&rsquo;. It is a neat display whereby a message
travels across the screen, descending line by line until it reaches the bottom,
then there is a flurry of multiple displays. The message then goes to the top
line and the next message starts. It is useful as an eyecatcher and can be left
running if line 120 is included as this will repeat the whole series of messages.
