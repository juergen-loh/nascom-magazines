the usual &amp;FF.<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>This would explain why the new BIOS does not interfere with
extension memory boards on pages other than page zero, in the
Gemini/<?php externalLink("RAM&nbsp;B"); ?> paging
system. Anyway, when I get the chips together and get it all going, I will have a
nice tidy 64K system with an equally tidy 256K virtual disk. When that is done, I
intend to produce a couple of file updating programs in Pascal, so that I can
produce some sort of &ldquo;bench-mark&rdquo;, and give you some indication of what sort of
difference these changes make to the speed of operation of the system.

<u>&lsquo;Pluto review&rsquo;, he said casually.</u>
</h3>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t know where the money for all this stuff is going to come from,
but I have bought it anyway! Unlike MAP 80, IO Research took quite a while to
send my
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
out, but then they do say that the board is selling like hot cakes.
It is even being sold to the makers of non-80-Bus computers, for use as a
graphics unit on their bizarre (i.e. non 80-Bus) computers. I did try asking for
an OEM discount, but it did no good at all. I bet you thought all the hardware
manufacturers would be sending out free boards to likely reviewers, in order to
get favourable reviews printed. Well, it may be like that in glossy magazine
land, but there ain&rsquo;t no free lunch out here in amateur land, yet! (Of course it
is a hint, Mr Manufacturer, of course it is.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway. The board is of a high standard of construction, and all those
things I would write if I thought you wanted to be told. Come on now chaps!
Anything that costs this much is going to be of a high standard, or you would
have heard rumours to the contrary. What you get is eight inches square, green,
and packed with components. There are three rows of RAM chips, making 192K, an
8088 processor, TTL chips galore, and something with 40 pins whose function is
unknown to me. The latter is probably some sort of video controller chip. [Ed. &ndash;
a <?php externalLink("MC6845","6845"); ?> CRIC chip, as used on the Gemini
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
and Nascom <?php externalLink("AVC","Avc",""); ?>.]
Then there are two
connection plugs at the outer edge, one with twenty pins, for connection to a
colour monitor, the other with fifty pins (I think) which is for connection to
the
<?php externalLink("Mini Palette","Pluto Palette",""); ?>,
when it appears. Also supplied is a manual. This is somewhat
terse in its explanations of quite complicated matters. The pages are not all in
the sequence you expect, there being appendices in the middle of the text. There
are two example programs, one in BASIC, one in assembler, but they don&rsquo;t do a
lot. The most useful thing in the whole slim volume is a table of all the control
codes the board accepts, listing all the parameters they need, and what values
they return. Sounds like Pascal, doesn&rsquo;t it? A nice touch in the manual is the
way the routines are described, with headings that look like Pascal procedure and
function headings. This has made me start thinking about producing some sort of
software package to interface <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal to the Pluto, along the lines of a
little known utility called Vortex, that I cobbled together a while ago. This
time I won&rsquo;t have to write a line drawing routine, that&rsquo;s for sure! The manual
also tells you how to connect the board up to a video monitor, as long as you
know which connection is which on the monitor! No, it isn&rsquo;t always obvious, that
would make life too simple. Just to make life more entertaining, I managed to
wire mine up wrong, but failed to destroy my nice colour monitor. See later
section, for a very relieved review&hellip;

<p>
As far as your computer is concerned, the Pluto is just two ports
(similar to the Gemini
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>),
normally &pound;A0 and &pound;A1, although these addresses can
be changed if you have to. Port &pound;A0 is the status port &ndash; if bit 7 is set when the
port is read, then Pluto is ready to receive a command. Writing anything at all
to this port resets Pluto. Port &pound;A1 is the data port, through which you send all
the commands and data needed to produce the pretty pictures, and read data sent
back by Pluto in response to your requests. It might at first seem necessary to
check the status before you send each byte, but this is not so. Once the command
byte has been accepted, and the status port says Pluto is ready, data can be sent
as fast as a 4MHz Z80 is able to do it. This includes the use of the amazing Z80
block output instructions.
