<h4>
Publishing Deadlines
</h4>
<p>
All things being relative and equal, this issue should be the third one
that you have received after fairly accurate two monthly intervals. Having
achieved this amazing regularity, it now becomes possible to start announcing
publishing-schedules. For a start, as you know, we do not have a great army of
staff-writers, in fact we don&rsquo;t have any at all! Consequently we are pleased to
receive articles for consideration at any time, but would prefer it to be well
before the end of the second week of each odd month, if there is to be a chance
of getting the article in the
<a href="../../../22/01/text/#page">next issue</a>.
</p>
<p>
Potential articles may be submitted in any form, but their relative
chances of publication range from disks [any Gemini format (SD, DD or QD) and
many others (Superbrain, Osborne, Xerox, IBM 8&Prime; etc &ndash; but what are you doing with
one of those!)], down through tapes [Nascom&nbsp;2/3 or Gemini RP/M formats, or N1
with CUTs], and then neat typing/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>handwriting on clean, uncrumpled paper. The
lowest chance of getting something published is obtained by sending in an Nascom&nbsp;1
format tape, as we can&rsquo;t read those! Crumpled loo paper is a better bet!
</p>
<p>
Advertisers should send in camera ready copy by the end of an odd month,
and should, preferably, book space about one week before that. Rates are
available upon application, but you can be assured, of course, that they are
extremely reasonable! All private ads. are free of charge, providing that they
are advertising unwanted hardware/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>software, and are not for &lsquo;commercial gain&rsquo;.
Clubs may also send in details of their meetings and activities, and these will
be published free of charge when space permits.
</p>
<h4>
Maintaining Order
</h4>
<p>
I am currently trying to draw up, for publication, a chart showing all of
the Z80 I/O ports occupied by the various 80-BUS/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nasbus products, the aim of
which is to ensure that there are no clashes. Unfortunately, I am not getting on
very well with it. I have spoken to a variety of manufacturers, all of whom have
promised to send me details, but most of whom haven&rsquo;t. So, if you manufacture, or
are about to manufacture, an 80-BUS/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nasbus compatible board that uses I/O ports,
please send me:
</p>
<p class="indent">
1) Details of the standard port assignments.<br>
2) Details of the optional assignments (if any).<br>
3) Does the board support NASIO and DBDR correctly?
</p>
<p>
Hopefully I will be able to publish a complete
<a href="../../../23/26/text/#article1">I/O map</a>
in the next issue.
If it is incomplete I will put in <b>VERY BIG LETTERS</b> the names of the unobliging
companies.

<h4>
Moving Technology
</h4>
<p>
This Editorial is brought to you courtesy of Wordstar 3 and a Gemini
Galaxy 3. Wordstar is very much the &lsquo;industry de facto standard&rsquo; CP/M word
processing software. It is, in many ways, nowhere near as easy to sit down in
front of and type away as the &rsquo;PEN series (Naspen, Diskpen, Gempen), but I have
been using those for four(?) years now and therefore have gained a certain
understanding of them. Wordstar, on the other hand, has some pretty amazing
features, the least of which must be the <b>highlighting</b> and the <u>underlining</u>
facilities, not to mention the <sub>sub-</sub>scripts and the <sup>super-</sup>scripts, and a massive
host of other features. I&rsquo;ll let you know how I get on. The Galaxy 3, by the way,
is as Galaxy 2 but with a 5.4&nbsp;MByte Winchester and 800Kbyte floppy, and on this
one there is a Qume Sprint 5 attached. I can&rsquo;t work out how I ever managed to
produce the old
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/text/#head">INMC mags</a>
using a NAS&shy;COM1, cassettes, and an arthritic IBM
typewriter. Those were the days......
</p>
<p>
And finally, talking of moving technology(!), please note our <u><b>NEW ADDRESS</b></u>
as given on the opposite page. By the time you get this we should have moved.
