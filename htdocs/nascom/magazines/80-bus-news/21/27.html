The manuals and guides to CP/M should be consulted for more details.
</p>
<p>
CP/M uses RAM below 100H as a Workspace and Buffer area. Above the workspace,
starting at 100H is the <span class="uppercase">Transient Program Area</span> (TPA). This is where all programs
other than CP/M reside and operate. The TPA extends up through memory, including
the CCP area of CP/M. In the systems drawn, the TPA will run from 100H to
E000H/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>E400H, which is around 56K or 57K bytes.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="uppercase">Consol Command Processor</span> (CCP) is the area of CP/M that interacts with the
user. It supports commands like DIR, REN, TYPE, ERA, etc. and allows selection of
other drives, loading of files etc; When programs are loaded and run, the CCP is
not needed, so the 2K of space that it occupies can be used by programs.
</p>
<p>
Above the CCP is the <span class="uppercase">Basic Disk Operating System</span> (BDOS). The user accesses the
BDOS through the jump at 0005H, to use the 36 or so Functions that are available
such as Keyboard input, Screen output. Disk read, and so on. The BDOS is 3.5K
long and cannot be overwritten.
</p>
<p>
The final unit, at the very top of memory is the <span class="uppercase">Basic Input Output System</span>
(BIOS). Often called CBIOS, the C standing for <span class="uppercase">Customized</span>. i.e. altered to
suit.). This part of CP/M is not supplied by <span class="uppercase">Digital Research</span>, but by the
suppliers of the Computer. The job of the BIOS is to marry together the standard
CCP/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>BDOS to the thousand and one different Hardwares that have to run CP/M. The
BIOS will therefore vary from computer to computer. The quality of the BIOS
varies tremendously from system to system, and CP/M can get a bad name because
the BIOS is poor. The various BIOS&rsquo;s available to run on the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GEMINT
implementation contain features that are not always common. In some cases they
are almost unique. <span class="uppercase">Richard Beal</span>, the author of NAS&shy;SYS seems to have made a
speciality of writing a very powerful CBIOS for <span class="uppercase">Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini</span> systems that he
calls &lsquo;SYS&rsquo;, and this article describes how to replace the origional CBIOS with
&lsquo;SYS&rsquo; CBIOS.

1) If you are overwriting the standard BIOS by one of your own you may find that
insufficient space is available for it. The obvious solution to this problem is
to generate a slightly smaller CP/M system to give yourself more room (eg MOVCPM
63 * in a 64k system). However this results in the loss of 1k of memory from the
TPA, which seems quite excessive if you only want an extra 100 bytes. By changing
one byte in the MOVCPM.COM file you can move the memory image of CP/M down (or
up!) in increments of 256 bytes. The byte is at 23Dh and holds the number of
256-byte pages that MOVCPM.COM adds on to the system it generates to allow for
workspace area for the BIOS. Increasing the current value of this byte by one
will give you an additional 256 bytes of memory, and pro rata.
</p>
<p>
Remember that the extra memory does not appear out of fresh air, CP/M just moves
down a bit to allow a little more room for the BIOS.
</p>
<p>
2) As Mr. Bowden points out, there is little point in saving a large
workspace/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>buffer area on the system track of the disk, and so all workspace
should be placed at the end of the BIOS so that all the code, (which HAS to be
saved on the disk), comes first. However an additional saving can be made in the
BIOS memory requirements by realising that certain sections of the code are used
once only on start-up. A prime example of this is the sign-on message, which only
appears when the system starts up from cold, and then is never seen again. All
the Gemini BIOS&rsquo;s have the sign-on message stored in the area of memory that the
BIOS uses for workspace, as it will be printed before the BIOS actually uses any
of that area as workspace.
