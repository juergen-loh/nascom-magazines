<table>
<tr><td>1)</td><td>I have included &ldquo;signon&rdquo; messages and also a &lsquo;Putvid&rsquo; type of screen
		printing routine. These are copied to RAM at 09000H and &lsquo;Jumped to&rsquo; by
		the COLD BOOT LOADER after CPMSYS64 has been loaded. If I need routines
		like &ldquo;cinit&rdquo; or UART initialization, they can be placed in this area of
		memory as well. After printing the &lsquo;signon&rsquo; messages the routine jumps
		to BIOS to start CP/M. Any CP/M that contains OLDBIOS, and does not have
		a modified COLD BOOT will skip these messages but will display its&rsquo; own
		messages.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2)</td><td>I have modified the &lsquo;TAB&rsquo; routine so that 16 locations are displayed on
		a line, in HEX and ASCII. The HEX is displayed in columns of four bytes.
		This mod. is really more useful with the IVC card display as there is
		a lot of &lsquo;wrap around&rsquo; on the NASCOM 48 wide screen, but it can be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3)</td><td>I have also added a few extra bytes so that I can now &lsquo;Dump&rsquo; the &lsquo;TAB&rsquo;
		output to my IMP Printer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4)</td><td>The &lsquo;SIMON&rsquo; signon messages have been increased to show that a modified
		SIMON is in use. A list of Command keys is also displayed as a reminder
		of the commands available in SIMON.</td></tr>

<p>
It may be necessary in the future to add a &lsquo;cinit&rsquo; routine, and it would also be
possible to include any special initialization routines for UARTS etc. By
reducing the very extensive &lsquo;signon&rsquo; messages, or using an even larger ROM (!)
there is scope for almost any addition, such as direct Memory dump to
cassette/disk, and so on.
</p>
<p>
N.B. If the initialization routines in middle memory make any calls to CP/M to
print messages, or to clear characters as &ldquo;cinit&rdquo; does, then since CP/M has at
that stage NOT been started, it will be necessary to initialize the &lsquo;&nbsp;BDOS jump&nbsp;&rsquo;
and IOBYTE in low memory BEFORE making any calls to BDOS otherwise the system
will &lsquo;die&rsquo;.

I hope that this article has been of some help to others who, like me want to
learn more about some of the less well documented features and operations of CP/M
systems. (&nbsp;I must apologise however, to the Authors of the various Programs for
the liberties that I, an amateur &lsquo;hacker&rsquo;, have taken with their software, and
hope that this will be accepted in the cause of &lsquo;&lsquo;Learning&rsquo;.)

80BUS NEWS No 1. (N.B. There is an error in the diagram on page 45 of that
article. The wiper of S1A goes to pin 2 of LKS1, not to pin 3.)
