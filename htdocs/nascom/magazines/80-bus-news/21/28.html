With the current BIOSs for the Gemini Galaxy and Multiboard systems the idea has
been extended by including all the initialisation code that is only executed
once. This covers items such as <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> initialisation, UART initialisation, printing
the sign-on message, setting up the parameters of the &ldquo;Memory&rdquo; drive, setting up
the Winchester disk controller, ....and so on. This results in a saving of 300+
bytes in the BIOS memory requirements.

3) SIMON and the boot sector. As pointed out by Mr Bowden the SIMON for the
Nascom loads the boot sector in its entirity to high memory and then copies the
first 128 bytes down to 0. The SIMON for Galaxy/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Multiboard reads in the boot
sector directly to 0, but does not load any data after the first 128 bytes, (the
remaining bytes are discarded without being stored). In each case this was done
deliberately, to ensure that the TPA was left unaltered by the actions of SIMON.

This means that when your next door neighbour turns on his arc welder and dims
the lights of the neighbourhood (crashing your editor) just after you&rsquo;ve spent
four hours typing in a program, you can press reset with some degree of hope.
Once CP/M has been reloaded you can then type &ldquo;SAVE 250 JUNK&rdquo; (or some such large
number). This will save the entire contents of memory to a disk file &ldquo;JUNK&rdquo;.
GEMDEBUG can then be used to reload it, and hopefully you can find your source
somewhere in what was the memory buffer of the editor. Move it down to 100h, add
a few 1Ahs on the end, exit and then do another &ldquo;SAVE&rdquo; and you should have your
source file.
</p>
<p>
In other words I arranged it so that if you are ever forced to press &ldquo;Reset&rdquo; you
can get a disk copy of the TPA (as it was when you pressed reset), and hopefully
recover something from it, either a data file, or information of what might have
lead to the crash. So there was no &lsquo;malice aforethought&rsquo; in ignoring the extra
384 bytes!

(Note GEMDEBUG will load as much of JUNK in as it can. ZSID on the other hand
will give an &lsquo;out-of-memory&rsquo; message and return to CP/M. In the later case you
can try using the &ldquo;S&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; commands of PIP to split the file up into smaller
segments).
