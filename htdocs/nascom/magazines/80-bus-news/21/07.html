Having got these two exceptions out of the way, let us now look at the
effect of an NMI. When the CPU recognises that the NMI line is active, it
immediately saves the address of the current instruction, performing a call to
location 0066H. Here, in theory, is the service subroutine for the NMI
interrupts. This service routine should do whatever is required on an NMI and
finish with a RETN (RET from NMI) instruction. This RETN instruction behaves like
an ordinary RET instruction in popping the return address off the stack, but also
acts as a signal to the CPU that the NMI routine is finished, and that the
previous status of the normal interrupt structure can be restored. An NMI will
automatically disable any other interrupts, saving the status until its own
service routine is finished. So, if interrupts were enabled before an NMI, they
are enabled afterwards, and contrariwise.
</p>
<p>
On the Nascom, the NMI is used for a specific purpose, well known to
those of us who are into machine code. This is to provide a Single Step facility.
(On Gemini systems the NMI is uncommitted, and Single Stepping is provided in
software by Gemdebug.) The Nascom Single Step works as follows: on Execution of a
command, a bit is set in Port 0. This bit is clocked through a succession of
flipflops, ending up toggling the /NMI pin of the CPU. The CPU immediately jumps
to the service routine, which looks to see if the instruction executed was an E
or S. If E, the CPU carries on with the next instruction, but if S, it prints the
register display.
</p>
<p>
As the Nascom has ROM at location 0066H (unless it is set up to run
CP/M), you might assume that other use of the NMI is out of the question for
Nascom users. Not so! At 0066H is a jump to 0C7DH, and this address is in RAM, so
we can patch in here the address of our NMI handler. N2 owners can connect an NMI
switch to their machine, which triggers a monostable to give a nice clean pulse,
normally causing the register display to be printed out. N1 users can get this
with a little

Its use is for those occasions
when a program locks in a loop due to a programming flaw. Hitting NMISW can find
where this loop is, and speed up debugging. N2 owners can also connect an NMI
Signal to Bus line 21. <?php externalLink("Zilog"); ?> suggest that the NMI be used for catastrophic
events, such as a power failure, where big capacitors on the PSU lines could
maintain power for a short time after mains failure, long enough to save the data
to disk perhaps. Using it to provide a single step facility will be regarded by
most Nascom Users as quite satisfactory, but I deal with the NMI specifically
because it is a free interrupt handling method, and when using the Z80 as the
basis for an intelligent controller of some sort, it might provide an elegant
simplification of the unit. To give you an idea of the potential power of the
NMI, it is the method by which the
<?php externalLink("IMP"); ?>
printer is driven. Within the IMP, an NMI
is caused at regular intervals. The internal CPU (a Z80&nbsp;&ndash; what else!) switches
the address of the NMI routine around between a number of routines to look after
checking for new data and printing each column of dots.

<p>
Now we move on to the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; interrupts. There are three schemes. These
are called Interrupt Mode 0, 1 and 2, and invoked by instructions IM n, where n
is the appropriate number.
</p>
<p>
Interrupt Mode 0 is identical to the <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> interrupt response mode. At the
end of each instruction, the CPU looks at /INT (pin 16). If this line has gone
low, something has requested an interrupt. Note that this line need not be low
when examined. Its status is internally latched and reset when the CPU reads it.
The CPU acknowledges this if interrupts have been enabled by making /M1 and /IORQ
lines go low. The interrupting device is supposed to recognise this signal and to
place the next instruction to be executed on the bus. Normally this instruction
is a restart, which is a call to one of 8 specific locations, but it can be an
actual three byte call if you wish, and if you can sort out how to do it! While
acknowledging the interrupt, the CPU executes two wait states to allow time for
the peripheral devices to sort out which one has priority. When it accepts an
