machine code onto a different processor then a Cross-Assembler package is an
extra. Printer spooling is also supported and a turtlegraphics package is
available. A special utility to read and write CP/M files is also available
enabling the transfer of data and text files from one operating system to
another. This utility even goes one up on PIP by allowing you to reconfigure the
block size, disk capacity, directory length, etc. for different disks. (With PIP
you are stuck with the parameters specified in your BIOS.)
</p>
<p>
On the commercial side,
<?php externalLink("UCSD Pascal","UCSD"); ?>
still lags a little behind CP/M (in terms of the
amount of applications software available), but that situation is changing
rapidly.
</p>
<p>
Although originally developed for a university/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>educational
environment, it was
commercial interest which led to the setting up of SoftTech Microsystems to
market the UCSD p-System. When implementations of UCSD for the
<?php externalLink("Apple II","Apple"); ?> and
SuperBrain became available &ndash; the Apple adaptation, in particular, proving very
popular (outselling even Visicalc) they were the motivation for a wide range of
business software. More recently, Sirius, IBM and Osborne have adopted UCSD. The
latest state-of-the-art business micro, the Sage&nbsp;II, based on the Motorola 68000
and streets ahead of the other 16-bit micros, has adopted UCSD as its favoured
operating system. In addition, many universities (including Oxford, Cardiff, Bath
and Edinburgh) run UCSD as their favoured environment for micros. The portability
and adaptability of the system means that it can run on even cheaper micros (e.g.
Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini) and the price advantage must surely make UCSD on these micros a
very attractive proposition.
</p>
<p>
A considerable amount of business software is now on the market (a brief list is
available from me if you send an SAE (get my address from my Ad.)) for UCSD,
including the most advanced accounting, modelling, word processing and database
packages. (Some of these have even received the unprecedented bouquet of approval
by IBM for their Displaywriter and Personal Computer.) Most of these packages
were originally developed on an Apple. They were thus designed to run in limited
memory. The demand for them to run on IBM, Sirius, Sage, etc. has now required
that any hardware dependent features be removed and only the standard portable
I/O facilities be used. There should, therefore, be no problems in running them
straight away on a Nascom with 64K and some may run in 48K.

<h3>
<u>Nascom Implementation</u>
</h3>
<p>
When I set about implementing UCSD on my Nascom I was unemployed and desperately
looking for some way to earn some pennies. From the beginning, therefore, I had
my eye on the possibility of making the system available for sale.
</p>
<p>
I was immediately faced with the prospect of lots of different 80-Bus compatible
disk controllers, video controllers, and printers, several different types of
drives and several different disk formats. Since I had 8&Prime; drives (which I got
cheap because they had been discontinued) I obviously had to write my own disk
drivers anyway and so I decided to write a new boot ROM which would contain the
drivers for virtually any mix of controllers, drives and formats. This is called
AllBoot and more information can be had by sending an SAE to me. (I decided not
to bother with the old
<?php externalLink("Henelec"); ?>
controller which used the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> and was thus too
limited and incompatible with the Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM809"); ?>
and Lucas Logic FDC to make it
worth my while. I have not yet looked at the new Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
FDC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>hard disk card
either [Ed. &ndash; from a 5.25&Prime; point of view it is 100 per cent compatible with the
<?php externalLink("GM809","",""); ?>])
</p>
<h4>
Now for the actual implementation:
</h4>
<p>
The version provided for the Nascom (and planned for Gemini) will be an
implementation of the latest (version IV.1) Z80 Adaptable System. This allows for
future extension of the SBIOS to accommodate a hard disk and provides a versatile
