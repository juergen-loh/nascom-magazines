The interrupt structure of the 4280 microprocessor chip is one of the
least understood and at the same time potentially most powerful facilities
provided by this i.c. My purpose in writing these notes is to survey the
interrupt structures offered us, to encourage other users to try these out for
themselves.
</p>
<p>
It should be remarked immediately that it while it is relatively easy to
use one interrupt at a time, a complex set up is not easily obtained on a general
purpose machine, although on a dedicated machine such as a process controller it
is possible. It is very likely that a Nascom or Gemini system will be used as a
development system, to develop software for a purpose built dedicated controller.
This possibility underlies the following notes. Whether a dedicated controller
will be used, or the system software of a Nascom/Gemini modified to support
multiple interrupts is a matter for the individuals concerned, but it is
essential that each interrupt be set up and carefully debugged along the lines we
will examine.
</p>
<p>
By way of an aside, let me remark that a dedicated controller is no great
deal. Consider a minimum Z80 system. This could comprise a similar configuration
to that shown in Section 9 of the Mostek manual &ndash; a Z80, an EPROM, some RAM and a
PIO. It would also need an oscillator to provide a system clock. A minimum system
of this nature would not need any buffering, and could possibly be expanded with
another PIO or two before that became necessary. Such a system could be wired up
on a prototype board. What would it do? The PIO would allow it to sample or
switch up to 16 lines without getting involved in elaborate multiplexing
circuitry. A reasonable assumption might be that it would treat eight of these as
inputs, and the other eight as outputs. An example of what can be achieved in
this way was published in Micropower, Vol 2, No. 1, where it was shown how a
Nascom could control a washing machine. Another example of what a dedicated
system might do is to control a dot matrix printer, such as the IMP or EPSON.
</p>
<p>
As computer enthusiasts, we are concerned always with the finer points of
Z80 usage. We have two problems &ndash; to get the hardware to work and to get the
software written and debugged. These two problems are complementary and depend to
a certain extent one on the other. In these notes, I will deal only with the
software side of matters and will assume that the hardware is taken for granted
and assumed correct &ndash; that all signals are clean, bounce free, and of the correct
voltage levels. This is not always so!
</p>
<p>
The first interrupt structure on the Z80 is the Non Maskable Interrupt,
known familiarly as the NMI. Those familiar with the pinouts of the CPU chip will
know that pin 17 is called /NMI. This is an input, negative edge triggered. That
is, the transition from high level (normal condition) to low level tells the CPU
that an NMI is required. The CPU examines the state of this pin at the end of
every instruction, and if the pin is active, then it proceeds to service an NMI.
There are a small number of conditions which will prevent the NMI being
recognised, and I&rsquo;ll mention these to get them out of the way. The first, and not
very likely condition is if WAIT states are continually being requested the
current instruction is prolonged and never reaches an end. In consequence the NMI
test is never reached. Such a condition is hardly likely to arise in serious use
of a Nascom or Gemini, as the dynamic memory would not be refreshed, and the
program lost. It might happen in use of a Z80 based controller, where the machine
was executing Wait states, waiting for a very slow peripheral to react &ndash; said
peripheral having perhaps gone on the blink! The other failure to see an NMI is
if /BUSRQ is active, i.e. if something like a DMA chip has control of the bus.
