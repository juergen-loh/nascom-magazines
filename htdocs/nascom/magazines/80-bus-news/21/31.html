And what sort of instructions are there? Well, lots. For a start, there
are two screens of 640 by 288 dots, and any dot can be individually set to any of
the colours the board produces. So there is a routine to plot a point, given its
coordinates; there&rsquo;s another one to plot a point at a given x-y displacement from
the current position. This latter routine has two forms, one for distances that
can be expressed in a single byte, and one for longer distances. Then there&rsquo;s the
line drawing routines, also in three forms. There are routines to move to a given
point, or by a given displacement. It is possible to read the colour of a pixel,
again using absolute or relative coordinates. After all that, you could be
forgiven for thinking I have finished, but not a bit of it! Rectangles can be
filled, or even copied to another location. Part of one screen can even be copied
onto the other screen.

And each of the operations described above is influenced by two system
variables called WPROT and STYLE. WPROT is used to write protect one or more
colour planes, while STYLE determines whether the new information replaces the
old, or is combined with it in several other possible ways. For instance, the
colour being printed can be exclusive OR&rsquo;ed with the existing colour of a pixel.
This sort of thing can be used to produce red/green flashing text on a green/red
flashing background, if that is what turns you on. Text? But of course! The
standard ASCII character set is catered for, and an 80 column display can be
produced. It must be possible to amend CP/M to use this board as its display
device, somewhat like an amazing
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>,
but I may not even try. [Ed. &ndash; I know of
someone who did this some time ago, and commented on its amazing slowness due to
all the characters being held as dots, and the consequent amount of memory
shifting that has to be done when the screen is scrolled. The
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
suffers
similarly (but even worse I believe). He also commented that backspace was not
supported, and so &lsquo;cursor left, space, cursor left&rsquo; has to be issued by the CP/M
BIOS. It&rsquo;s an obvious case of horses for courses &ndash; text cards for text, and
colour graphics cards for ....] You see, there is a marvellous moment when the
ZX81 owner first notices that your computer has two screens. More to the point,
really, is the fact that I have a lot of software that uses the old Nascom
screen, or rather, its relocated equivalent. I don&rsquo;t really think I want to edit
these articles in colour, unless the magazine is going to change over to using a
colour plotter instead of the daisy wheel, and start looking like OZ...

As part of the Taunton Computer Club&rsquo;s latest theme program writing game,
I also wrote a thing that draws a picture of a winter scene. In this program, I
made use of the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
facility for defining new characters, of any kind and
colour whatsoever; these are referred to as symbols. Once a symbol has been
defined, it can be printed at whatever location is current, just by sending a
single byte out through the data port. This function is impressively fast, as is
the other very useful one I left out above. Referred to as &ldquo;polyfill&rdquo;, this fills
complex shapes in with colour. I saw someone using their BBC computer the other
day, and their polyfill routine (in BASIC, naturally) took ages, as well as not
always getting into all the corners. Having this sort of facility readily
available will make the rapid development of programs much more easy. I should be
able to do a really nice space invaders in no time...

It is a tremendous shame that such a superb lump of hardware is being let
down by the way IO run their business. They take a long time to send things out,
which can be forgiven when a firm is building up its business, and may be running
with less staff than it will have when things level off abit. But they could
easily send out a card to say they have had your order. They don&rsquo;t even bother to
answer all the letters they are sent, and this is unforgivable, when they are
being asked technical questions about the product they have sold you. The only
way to get answers to this sort of question seems to be to ring them up. Their
phone is more or less permanently engaged, of course, presumably by people who
want to know why their letters are ignored! I wanted to write about the
additional ROM, which contains even more amazing facilities like the marvellous
&ldquo;wallpaper&rdquo; routine, but after three weeks I am still waiting. Still, it will be
something to write about next time.
