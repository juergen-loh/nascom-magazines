interrupt, the Z80 CPU automatically disables interrupts, that is, it won&rsquo;t
accept any more until it is told to. This has the advantage that you can control
where your routines are interrupted. Say for example, that you had a disk unit,
which was driven under interrupt control. Every time it needs data, it interrupts
for it. Some disk units read data every 25uS, and if the data is not accepted in
time by the CPU they report an error. In addition&rsquo; to this disk, suppose you have
a RTC which ticks every 1/10 sec. Each tick is signalled by an interrupt, and the
CPU writes the time to the corner of the screen.
</p>
<p>
So, you are reading sectors from your disk and your clock is ticking
away. In the midst of the reading you get another interrupt for a tick, go and
service that, and return to your reading service routine. Unfortunately, your
tick service routine takes some 2 or 3 mS, and when you get back to reading,
you&rsquo;ve missed about 100 bytes so your disk reports a bad read. So you try again.
Same story. The only way you can deal with this is to let the CPU disable
interrupts on the first interrupt, and not to reenable them again until the read
is finished. Fair enough &ndash; a read is so quick that it won&rsquo;t matter if the clock
on the screen is not updated for a few 1/10s of secs. There is another way to
deal with the problem &ndash; interrupt priority. This assigns to each device a certain
priority, and only devices of higher priority than the device under service can
interrupt. We&rsquo;ll come to this in a moment or two. The 8080 interrupt response CIM
0) is automatically invoked after a reset, with interrupts disabled. This mode
allows (using the restarts) eight different interrupt handling routines. It is
possible to make a number of devices share common handing routines, or for the
appropriate routine to be selected for the device by the handler. This means that
the handler has to identify which device has interrupted, which adds to the time
overhead. In S100 systems, which were originally 8080 based, interrupt response
was often obtained by using unintelligent devices. When the peripheral response
was required, they did nothing. Using open collector bus drivers, the effect of
the pull up resistors was to make the bus read as high, so the CPU thought that
there was a byte OFFH on the bus. This meant that RST 38H was most frequently
used. This provoked Zilog into providing Interrupt Mode ij.

<p>
IM 1 is similar to the NMI response. On interrupt, the CPU executes a4
call to location 0038H. This allows only one interrupt handling routine, but has
the advantage of hardware simplicity. In a controller, there could be two
interrupts, the more important one on the NMI line, and the lesser on IM1. The
lesser interrupt could be disabled by the program at will, and by the NMI
routine. The NMI routine would alwavs take priority. In IM1, the peripheral
device need not place any byte on the bus. Use of that mode will automatically
get you to location O38H on interrupt.
</p>
<p>
The last interrupt mode of the Z80 is IM2. This is at once the most
interesting and the most baffling interrupt method. What happens is this: in the
I register, the CPU holds the high byte of an address of a table which points to
all the interrupt handling routines. On interrupt acknowledgement, the peripheral
places the low byte of an address on the bus. The CPU reads this byte and builds
up the address of a line of the table. From this line of the table, it takes the
address of the appropriate interrupt handling routine. The confusion arises
because the address built up by the CPU and peripheral is not the address of the
interrupt handling routine &ndash; it is the location where the address of the
interrupt handling routine is stored. Further complication is introduced by the
fact that we have to set up the &lsquo;I&rsquo; register. This cannot know the address of the
interrupt service table otherwise. We also have to tell the peripheral the
appropriate line of the Interrupt Service Table. We must not forget also that we
must construct this table, and all this before we Enable Interrupts. In addition,
the peripheral, if a Zilog peripheral, is so complex that we have to spend a
little time letting it know just what we want it to do.
