ports. This now gives you parallel processing. The main CPU can pass a
character over to the slave CPU saying &ldquo;deal with this please&rdquo;, and can then
get on immediately with its job of running your program.

I have recently heard of a problem somebody has been having with the Nascom
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
that nicely illustrates the point. He is (was?) writing a communications
package to run on his Nascom, and had run into trouble because he couldn&rsquo;t get
incoming characters into the display fast enough. The
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
can suffer from a
similar problem, (scrolling takes an appreciable time), but this can be
circumvented very easily by implementing a small circular buffer and
alternately polling the UART and the IVC [1]. Here one processor is handling
the display and keyboard while the other is acting as a postman between it and
the UART, and the postman can temporarily hold onto things if the display is
busy. However with the AVC the problem is more fundamental as the postman and
display driver programs can only run sequentially, not concurrently. Having
given the output routine a character to display the AVC driver was sometimes
taking so long to return that several incoming characters were lost. This
could be circumvented in two ways:
</p>
<table class="indentCol1">
<tr><td>i)</td><td>duplicate the screen driving code, and add &ldquo;poll UART &amp; buffer&rdquo; calls to
		it in the middle of all routines that take an appreciable length of time
		to execute. (i.e. Combine the &lsquo;postman&rsquo; and &ldquo;display driver&rdquo; in a single
		program, interleaving the two like a &ldquo;riffle shuffle&rdquo; with a pack of
		cards.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>ii)</td><td>Run the UART under interrupts.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The latter approach needs careful thought if the screen driver is busy paging
various parts of the memory in and out! Also it may interfere with any
software approach to transparent screen access.

<h3>
The
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
hardware
</h3>
<p>
The IVC is basically a small SBC (single board computer) containing the
following: A Z80A, 6845 display controller, 2K of shared screen memory, 4k of
character generator that may be a mixture of RAM and EPROM (the standard is 2k
of EPROM, 2k of RAM), 2k of workspace memory, EPROM program memory (2716 or
2732), and a few I/O ports. To the host 80-BUS system it appears as three I/O
ports. One port is a read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>write port through which data and commands are
passed to/from the IVC, one port is a read-only status byte that holds the
full/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>empty flags for the data port. The final port is a write-only port that
resets the IVC&rsquo;s processor.
</p>
<p>
Within that hardware context the features of the IVC are provided in software
by the on-board monitor IVC-MON. There have been several versions of the
monitor, and in the following sections I will cover various aspects of the
monitor, finishing off with a description of the differences between each
version.

I don&rsquo;t intend to regurgitate the software manual here &ndash; those that are
interested should be able to obtain a copy through their friendly Gemini
dealer &ndash; but table 1 is a copy of the command summary from the manual for
those that are not familiar with it.
