<h3>
<u>A Fix for Sys</u>
</h3>
<p>
Many of you disk users who are running under a certain O.S. are doubtless
using Richard Beal&rsquo;s excellent, although unfortunately no longer available,
Sys overlay BIOS. I certainly am, and excellent though Sys is, I have
encountered one or two minor problems. The &ldquo;fix&rdquo; I am suggesting here is to
make the &ldquo;Automatic Page Throw&rdquo; code a bit more intelligent. One problem is
that although my printer (an MX80 F/T) recognises form feeds, it doesn&rsquo;t do an
automatic &ldquo;skip over perforation&rdquo;, so I set the appropriate option to allow
Sys to do this. When you do this, Sys converts form feeds to CR/LFs. I didnt
like this, so I patched (there&rsquo;s that word again) Sys to output form feeds
unaltered. A problem exists, however, in that if a form feed is issued when
the printer is already at the top of a page, an extra page throw is sent which
results in a page being wasted. Things are further complicated when you
consider that some utilities may try to &ldquo;help&rdquo; by issuing extra CR/LFs to
ensure the perforation is skipped. An example may be NasDis running under
Monitor.Com. With Sys and Revas both supplying extra CR/LFs, the listing can
get &ldquo;out of step&rdquo;, so to speak.
</p>
<p>
The solution I have come up with is to make the &ldquo;Skip perforation&rdquo; code
in Sys more intelligent: if the printer is already at the top of the page, Sys
will &ldquo;throw away&rdquo; any extra form feeds, CRs and LFs that may be sent before
any printable characters are sent for that page. This code hasn&rsquo;t had the
fullest of tests, but I have checked it against a few trial runs of outputting
files which, because I have also got the &ldquo;line length&rdquo; check built into Sys,
had caused problems before. The listing is the part of module Sysb4.Mac, which
contains the printer driver. Both &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;old&rdquo; code is shown, with switches
to select the one you want. This should help you if you want to type in my
&ldquo;additions&rdquo;.

[Ed. &ndash; Mr Perkins article now goes into a discussion as to the rights and
wrongs of the current legal situation re. BIOS copyright, SYS, etc. As the
comments he makes are wholly mis-informed they have been removed, as to
comment on them would be sub-judice.]

<u>NASIO</u>
</h3>
<p>
It&rsquo;s good to see that the Editor is trying to draw up a map of all the
I/O ports used by the various boards available. However, the bit about Nasio
support perhaps doesn&rsquo;t go far enough, since some manufacturers don&rsquo;t do Nasio
properly. The 80-Bus specification says that Nasio is taken low to indicate a
Nascom I/O address, which to me means whenever you try to access ports 0-7
inclusive, which are the ports used on the N2 card. Therefore it should be
high at all other times. It is also an open-collector line. Now some
manufacturers simply invert address line A7 and call it &ldquo;Nasio&rdquo;. I know that
Map do this on both the ram and vfc. The clue comes in their documentation,
which says that the Nasio link is to be made &ldquo;...only if no other card is
generating Nasio&rdquo;. This implies that the line is NOT an OC line, and that bus
