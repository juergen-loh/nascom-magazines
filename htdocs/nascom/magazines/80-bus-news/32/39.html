be printed in front of and behind a decimal point.

HOLD &ndash; A real beaut. this one &ndash; especially when used with the CHAIN command.
HOLD followed by up to two line numbers will hold a range of lines for view in
a program so that another program may be appended to it or so that this range
only may be renumbered and thus moved to another part of the program. The
effect is that the rest of the program seems to have disappeared. In fact it
is still resident in memory but cannot be found with a LIST command nor
executed with a RUN command. The listable area can be modified however and
even RUN without affecting the hidden areas. LOADING another program removes
the listable area and also the upper hidden area 4f there is one but does not
destroy the lower hidden area. e.g. HOLD100,199 leaves lines 100 to 199 in
view and a command such as a renumbering command will only renumber that which
is in view.
</p>
<p>
MGE &ndash; Restores sanity to a held program.
</p>
<p>
HEX$ &ndash; Followed by up to two values returns the hexadecimal string
corresponding to the first value as a string of characters whose length is
dependant upon the second value (4 assumed if not specified). GeQe
HEX$(1234) returns the string 04D2. HEX$(100,2) returns the string 64.
</p>
<p>
INCH &ndash; Returns the ASCII value of the next input character which it waits for.
e.g A=INCH places the ASCII code of the next key pressed into the variable A
</p>
<p>
INCHS$ &ndash; Returns the next key pressed as for INCH above but as a one character
string. e.g AS=INCHS$. Also useful in conjunction with tape or disk files when
certain characters may cause undesired effects under an input condition. See
later commands on file handling.
</p>
<p>
KBD &ndash; Similar to INCH but scans keyboard and does not wait for a character.
KBD$ &ndash; As for INCH$ but does not wait for input.
</p>
<p>
RENUM &ndash; Renumbers a held program or the whole of it if a HOLD has not been
</p>
<p>
_previously issued. Used in conjunction with HOLD and MGE it is a very
</p>
<p>
versatile command.
</p>
<p>
IOM &ndash; Followed by two values. This command alters the bits in the IOMOD word
in the workspace which consists of sixteen one bit flags of which seven are
used at present in XBASIC. By setting the bits to 0 or 1 the operation of
certain areas can be modified. These require more explanation than is possible
here but it is with this command that one prevents the switch from Screen Edit
mode to Line Edit mode during a program run or disable the use of the break
</p>
<p>
key etc.
</p>
<p>
MOD &ndash; An operator which is the remainder from a division. It can be defined as
follows: AMODB=A- B* INT(A/B)- e-g 5 MOD 3 returns 2.
</p>
<p>
MULS$ &ndash; Followed by a string and a number returns the string repeated a number
of times dependant upon the number. e-g- MULS("*",5) returns the string *****.
</p>
<p>
PI &ndash; Returns the value 3.14159. Very useful with the AVC and is faster than
using a variable to hold the number for pi. This function actually uses
3.141593 but is only printed to five decimal places.
