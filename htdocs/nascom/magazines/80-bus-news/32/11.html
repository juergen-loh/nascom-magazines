hard on, effectively short-circuiting the output and blowing the fuse. The
triac will remain turned on until current ceases to flow through it (i.e. the
fuse blows and/or the power is turned off). Note that the crowbar is fitted
after the fuse: if it were fitted before the fuse, then should the fuse blow
the computer would no longer be protected against peripherals putting what
they like onto the 5v rail. I shall, in the best tradition of these things,
leave it as &ldquo;an exercise for the reader&rdquo; to verify that the circuit also works
should the power supply go more negative than &minus;0.7v. It goes without saying
that if you change the zener, you can use it on the other power rails.

<u>Monitor.Com &ndash; The Bugfix(es).</u>
</h3>
<p>
Once I had got CP/M going, the first thing I did (alright &ndash; the second,
first thing I did was to backup the master disk) was to install
<a href="../../../../micropower/12/12/text/#article1">Monitor.Com</a>,
using NAS&shy;SYS&nbsp;3 as the starting point. As many of you who are using this
excellent piece of software are probably aware, there are a couple of minor
&ldquo;bugs&rdquo; in the software, which are only significant if you (a) use overlays,
and (b) like filling the disk up! Before describing how to fix these
&ldquo;features&rdquo;, I shall describe how I found them and what I did.
</p>
<p>
To help ease the transition to disk and CP/M, I modified Zeap, Nasdis,
Debug to use the revised screen addresses, and I also took the opportunity to
relocate them to 1000 hex. I was soon &ldquo;REVASing&rdquo; files, and then loading Zeap
&ldquo;in over NasDis to edit the file. Needless to say it didn&rsquo;t appear to work: the
start of the &ldquo;REVASed&rdquo; file appeared to be total garbage. The excellent debug
facilities of NAS&shy;SYS soon pointed me in the right direction: the Fetch routine
appeared to be loading the last 128-byte block twice. I verified (using DDT)
that it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of CP/M itself, and so dis-assembled the disk
drivers that Chris had added. I then referred to the CP/M manuals to find out
what the code did.
</p>
<p>
It appeared that the Fetch routine was loading each 128-byte block, and
then checking the BDOS error code. Thus when the end-of-file was reached, this
wouldn&rsquo;t be detected until after the buffer (which contained the previously-loaded
block) had been copied (again). Luckily, most of the disk drivers in
Monitor.Com appear to be written in <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> code, rather than more compact Z80
code, so the &ldquo;patch&rdquo; (what a horrible word &ldquo;Patch&rdquo; is!) is fairly simple. It
consists of moving a few instructions and changing a few more instructions.
(Note that you can use Monitor.Com for this one &ndash; anyone using DDT earns
themself the &ldquo;Dodo of the Decade&rdquo; award.) Note also that all addresses given
assume that Monitor.Com was typed in at the same addresses as in the original
(Micropower), and sub-sequent, articles.
