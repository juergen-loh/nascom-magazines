in memory. It is quite short, and I would have put it here, but for two
things. One, I would have deprived the author of the chance of getting paid
for his work. Two, the program doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between the header blocks
and the program data, it just stores everything it reads. But the amount of
tape format compatibility between the two machines is a surprise. If I ever
find the time, I really must write a program to transfer things to and fro
properly. Or perhaps one or both of the above named programmers will get it
together first, and save me the bother!

<u>More Bit Power Please!</u>
</h3>
<p>
I thought I saw an advertisement for a sixteen bit Galaxy computer
recently! If there is such a thing in existance, it would be nice to know more
about it, such as what processor it uses, whether the board is to 80-BUS
standard and whether it can be bolted onto Marvin. If the manufacturers would
like it reviewed by me, they have only to pop one in the post! Meanwhile, I
have sent a request via Prestel to the ACC for information about their 68000
board, which could well make a nice project for me. I have not built anything
for a long time, and feel the need to solder something! I was not able to get
the 64 transputers I wanted...

<h3>
<u>General Stirring.</u>
</h3>
<p>
There must be more than one school using Nascoms, judging by the
different photographs one sees in various computer programmers&rsquo; magazines. It
would be nice to hear from the people who are using these machines, and to
know what they are using them for, whether they read this magazine, and
whether they want any kind of help from us!
</p>
<p>
And if I was in charge of the Nascom part of Lucas, I know which magazine
I would send my newsletters to, so that they would be published in the year
they were written!
</p>
<p>
Sorry this is so short, but I have to get back to M203, the Open
University cure for sanity, otherwise I will never know enough maths for the
unbelievable graphics program I will one day get round to writing!
