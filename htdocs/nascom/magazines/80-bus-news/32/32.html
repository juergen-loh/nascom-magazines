The internal power supply of the progammer provides all the necessary
voltages, and no power is drawn from the main system. As well as the various
programming voltages (25V, 21V, 12.5V) the EPROM supply voltage can be raised
to 6V, the level necessary if the &ldquo;intelligent programming algorithm&rdquo; is to be
implemented for the larger EPROMs (see below).

The programmer&rsquo;s box is made of metal and consists of an interlocking U-shaped
base (coloured black), and a U-shaped lid (coloured grey). With the
metal construction of the box and the internal mains transformer the weight of
the programmer is such that it sits nicely on a flat surface without any
tendency to scoot about while EPROMs are changed. Taking the lid off the box
reveals a very neat and compact arrangement. The main programmer logic is
contained on a single PCB that runs the length of the box. Underneath this PCB
is a toroidal mains transformer and a smaller pcb that carries the power
supply components.

<b>The Disk:</b> This holds three programs:&ndash;

<table class="indent">
<tr><td><b>PROG.COM</b>		</td><td>The programmer software.</td></tr>

The disk is in Gemini QDSS format (i.e. single sided Galaxy format&nbsp;&ndash; 96tpi)
which can also be read by double-sided sytsems (QDDS format). The manual
indicates that you should be able (via your dealer) to exchange it for DDDS or
SDDS formats (the early Gemini 48tpi formats). Failing that you can ask for a
paper listing of PROGINIT.MAC instead. Some dealers may be able to provide
other formats.

<b>The Manual:</b> The eight page manual covers the installation of the programmer,
and the use of CPROG and PROG. Also a brief section is included on how
Microsoft&rsquo;s M80/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>L80
combination can be used to create ROMable programs, There
is no description of the internal circuitry of the programmer nor is there any
information on how it should be driven by any program other than that
supplied. (But see PROGINIT.MAC below.)
</p>
<h3>
Using the Software
</h3>
<p>
The configuration program <b>CPROG</b> allows the user to change two parameters
within <b>PROG.</b> The first is the base address of the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> that is driving the
programmer, and the second is the default EPROM type that PROG assumes when it
is invoked. The latter option saves the user the irritation of having to use
the &lsquo;Change EPROM type&rsquo; option every time that PROG is used.
</p>
<p>
The main program <b>PROG</b> drives the programmer, and transfers data in both
directions between disk files and a EPROMs via a buffer that it maintains in
memory. When invoked it puts up a heading together with a menu from which the
following options can be selected:
</p>
<table class="indentCol1">
<tr><td>0&nbsp;&ndash;</td><td>Return to CP/M.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1&nbsp;&ndash;</td><td>Change EPROM type. This brings up a sub-menu offering the choice of <?php externalLink("2716","",""); ?>,
		<?php externalLink("2732","",""); ?>, <?php externalLink("2732A"); ?>, <?php externalLink("2764","",""); ?>, 27128, and 27256.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2&nbsp;&ndash;</td><td>Read an EPROM into the buffer. This prompts for an EPROM to be inserted
		into the socket, and then reads it into the buffer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3&nbsp;&ndash;</td><td>Read a disk file into the buffer. (A prompt for a file name will appear.)</td></tr>
