<p>
Odd features of the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
stem from the Nascom background. e.g. the alternative
screen format being 48 characters per line. The block graphics are those of
the Nascom&nbsp;2, rather than the teletext standard. (Same symbols, just
controlled by different bits within the byte.)
</p>
<p>
The
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
accepts 8-bit characters from the host system. All the standard
printable ASCII characters (whose codes are in the range 20-7F), and all
characters for the alternate character generator (whose codes are in the range
80H-FFH), are placed directly into the display at the current cursor position.
Characters in the range 00-1FH are interpreted as control characters, and are
used to control the extensive features of the
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>.
</p>
<p>
One reason why I have been looking for a review of the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
is to see if anbody
feels that important features are lacking from the escape sequences. (Do you
all want protected fields? Do you want a &ldquo;page&rdquo; mode as well as a &ldquo;Scroll&rdquo;
mode?) My feeling, echoed recently in these pages by David Hunt, is that 97%
of users do not use anything other than the few basic functions like &lsquo;cursor
addressing&rsquo; that are used by programs such as Wordstar and dBase II.

<h3>
Attributes
</h3>
<p>
The
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
supports a single flexible attribute. This is the programmable
character generator (pcg), sometimes refered to in the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
documentation as
the alternate or upper character generator. On power-up the contents of the
standard character generator (an EPROM) are copied to the alternate character
generator and are inverted on the way. This means that by using the alternate
character generator, (either by setting the msb of a character before it is
sent to the
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>,
or using the sequence &lt;ESC&gt;&nbsp;A to make the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
do it for you),
video-inverse characters can be displayed. (e.g. to highlight headings and
menus within Wordstar and other such programs.) Note that inverse video is the
default setting, there is nothing to stop you programming other bit
combinations into the character boxes. For example you could set up a Greek
alphabet or a series of specialist mathematical symbols for use by a custom
wordprocessing package. The Henry&lsquo;s package HI-RES uses the pcg to offer a
pseudo high resolution graphics mode on the
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>.

<h3>
Transparent access
</h3>
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, the absence of visual interference on the screen when
the on-board processor accesses the screen memory is essential. There are
various ways that this can be achieved, but this to some extent depends upon
the choice of controlling microprocessor. If a Motorola 6800 had been used for
the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
processor, then a very neat arrangement could have been implemented
where the processor and display accesses could have been interleaved, leaving
each controller in total ignorance of the other. However history dictated that
a Z80 was used. The Z80 has asynchronous memory cycles, (asynchronous to the
extent that its memory cycles are not all the same length), and so it can not
easily be arranged to access the display memory between each displayed
character. With the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
design the easy way out was taken, and the Z80 was
given priority access to the display memory. (i.e. it can barge in when ever
it likes.) However the horizontal and vertical sync pulses and the display
blanking signal from the display controller are routed to a port so that the
Z80 can monitor their state. Thus, by monitoring this port, it knows when it
can safely &ldquo;barge in&rdquo; and update the screen memory without causing any
interference on the display.
