<u>Letters to the Editor</u>

<h3>
<u>Nascom Plus Typewriter</u>
</h3>
<p>
Congratulations to you and your team on 80-BUS News. Has anyone tried
using an Olivetti or Sanyo dual purpose printer/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>electric typewriter on a
Nascom&nbsp;2 yet? For some user-friendly advice on this would be well received.
Electric typewriters have limited graphics but good quality printing.
</p>
<p>
With all good wishes, Ambrose Lambert, Stratton on the Fosse, Bath.

<h3>
<u>POLYDOS</u>
</h3>
<p>
Hello, angry of Tonyrefail here (again). Just writing to let you know
that (i) my Nascom has just committed suicide, (ii) my dandruff has entered
the terminal stage, and (iii) since writing to you a few months ago on the
subject of starting a program exchange group for POLYDOS users, a la Dr.
Dark&rsquo;s &ldquo;circle of iron&rdquo;, I have received NO letters from you or anyone else (I
counted them twice, just to make sure, and it&rsquo;s definitely NONE!).
</p>
<p>
I know my letters tend to be a little flippant, but I hope you took the
time to read my last letter before throwing it in the bin! Or perhaps the
people who use Polydos are a bit more apathetic than &rdquo;yer average NAS-NUT, and
I&rsquo;m the only one &lsquo;wot wrote to you&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you do hear from anyone interested in starting a Polydos fan
club would you please TELL ME ABOUT THEM. Or, if such a group already exists,
could you put ME in touch with THEM?
</p>
<p>
Do you know how lonely it is living half-way up a Welsh mountain? It
would be very nice to talk to someone. Well, it&rsquo;d make a change from talking
to the sheep, they all have BBC micros, and hence, can&rsquo;t run POLYDOS (BAA)!!!
</p>
<p>
Yours, D.G. Richards, Tonyrefail, Mid Glamorgan.

<h3>
<u>Nascom &ndash; Who Are They?</u>
</h3>
<p>
Could somebody who reads this letter who is someway involved with
Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Lucas Logic please tell us why we, that is the devoted keyboard
bashers, never hear or see anything advertised or reviewed to run on the
micro? I personally have had a Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini etc., since it first came out
(October 1979 I think) and whilst Gemini have continued to advertise on their
own and through the Microvalue group, Lucas apparently have gone into limbo,
is it the lull before the storm?
</p>
<p>
I now am presently looking to upgrade my system to high resolution colour
with a Pluto board, if I can find somebody that stocks it and doesn&rsquo;t only get
to special order, so that I can receive via the computer the weather satellite
pictures transmitted from such as Meteosat 2. I have at present got a system
working on a BBC model B which works, but the colour resolution and definition
isn&rsquo;t high enough (note this is linked to the Nascom via the RS423/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>RS232
port), so if there is anybody reading this who wants to get rid of a Pluto
board (cheap!!) I would be very interested and then I could write a piece
telling you how I did it.
</p>
<p>
One other point can somebody at Henry&rsquo;s tell me if there are any more
SYS&rsquo;s for CP/M since number 15 and if the Utilities disc has been added to or
revised in the last six months.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully, D.J. Roche, B. Tech (Hons) A.M.I.E.E., Workshop, Notts.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
[Ed. &ndash; On the question of SYS, this was withdrawn from sale some months ago,
as outlined in previous issues of this mag. As regards one of your other
points &ldquo;Dear Nascom &ndash; is there anyone alive there?"]
