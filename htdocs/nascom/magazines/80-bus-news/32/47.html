In general, there is a suprisingly small impact on performance in taking this
approach. This can be seen by considering the usual practical overheads in
displaying a line of text on the screen. To do this an application program
loads a byte from memory into a register, updates and saves the pointer into
the character string, and then calls the operating system to output that
character. The operating system then determines where to send the character,
(e.g. checking the IOBYTE in CP/M), and finally sends it on its way. A simple
assumption that can be made in this scenario is that the IVC can put
characters into the screen display at a maximum rate of one per displayed
line, i.e. one every 64uS during the line blanking interval. (A remote-terminal
would have to work at a line rate of 156k baud to match this!) This
display rate of one byte per 64uS is likely to be of the order of the Host
system&rsquo;s overhead, if not a bit faster, and so the display rate is actually
limited by something other than the internal display technique of the IVC.
(Note that once the IVC has accepted the character for display the Host system
is free to go off and collect the next character. Thus the IVC&rsquo;s &lsquo;average&rsquo;
waiting time of 32uS to get that character into the display is not wasted
time, as the Host is not held up by it.)

<p>
The one time that the display technique does have an impact on the performance
of the IVC is in the scrolling rate. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; the IVC doesn&rsquo;t
scroll exceptionally slowly &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that it could go faster! I did briefly
experiment with using a hardware feature of the display controller that
resulted in a scroll rate of over 1000 lines/sec but dropped it for various
reasons:

<table class="indentCol1">
<tr><td>i)</td><td>It was far too fast and would require another escape sequence to let

<tr><td>ii)</td><td>It complicated the monitor software in various places.</td></tr>
<tr><td>iii)</td><td>It made the implementation of the &lsquo;non-scrolling&rsquo; lines more complicated,
		and if a significant number of lines were &lsquo;locked&rsquo; on the screen the
		situation returned to the original problem. (Either &lsquo;locked&rsquo; lines are
		left alone and the rest of the screen memory contents moved, or the main
		screen stays in place in the display memory and the &ldquo;locked&rdquo; lines have
		to be moved to the new display start address!)</td></tr>

Keyboards

<p>
The IVC includes a port to which a keyboard can be attached. This makes sense
as it effectively turns the IVC into a terminal which is then connected to the
Host 80-BUS system. (The connection is via the 80-BUS backplane rather than a
conventional RS232 link.) The IVC continually monitors the keyboard port and
passes all characters from the keyboard to the Host via an internal 64-character
buffer. Thus, whenever a key on the keyboard is pressed, the
character is read and stored in the buffer from whence it is extracted when
and if the Host system asks for it. Thus a fast typist can hammer away secure
in the knowledge that nothing will be missed. In fact it is quite useful to be
able to &lsquo;type ahead&rsquo; with some programs, although this should be done with
caution until you are sure that the program will accept it. (Some programs
poll the keyboard often, and &lsquo;swallow&rsquo; characters they don&rsquo;t recognise. Others
stop polling as soon as they receive a single character that is not
immediately applicable, but they hold onto it for later.)

The point I&rsquo;m trying to make is that once you are familiar with certain
programs you can improve your throughput by typing in responses before the
next prompt appears. For example you can speed up the time taken to load a
Wordstar file and to get to a certain position within it. Having typed WS to
