<h3>
Another Hardware Tip
</h3>
<p>
Here is a hardware tip that is so massively useful, and yet has never
been put into print... The scenario: you&rsquo;ve just built (from a kit) the latest
goodie for your computer. The time comes to check the board for bad joints,
etc. Problem: the board is covered in flux splashes, making it difficult to
check the board properly. I have discovered that proprietary Dry-Cleaning
fluid is excellent at removing (fresh) flux from boards.
</p>
<p>
The technique is simple. Hold the board to be cleaned upside down (solder
side uppermost), and at an angle (with the edge connector at the top). Apply a
smallish amount of the fluid to the board, enough to wet the board. Using an
old toothbrush (or similar), scrub the solder joints to ensure that the flux
is loosened and dissolves in the fluid. Allow the fluid to run to the bottom
of the board, carrying the flux with it (now you see why the edge connector
has to be at the top &ndash; flux is a good insulator!), and allow to drip off the
board and evapourate. Repeat with another small amount of fluid to &ldquo;rinse&rdquo; the
board. If, after this lot has evapourated the board is sticky to the touch,
there is still some flux left on the board, and another scrub/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>rinse is
required.
</p>
<p>
There are several points to note: this stuff evapourates very fast, so
unless you can afford to &ldquo;slosh it around&rdquo; work on small areas of the board at
a time. Second, and more important, this stuff is POISONOUS, so make sure the
room is WELL VENTILATED (don&rsquo;t want to lose any readers!). Third, for some
reason this only works on fresh flux: it won&rsquo;t work on that board you made six
months ago. This is probably due to the flux oxidising, or something.
</p>
<p>
The end result will be a VERY professional finish, and it will be
simplicity itself to find bad soldered joints. I tried this on my Ram after it
didn&rsquo;t work first time, and was surprised how many bad joints this revealed.
Once these had been fixed, I plugged my Ram back in, and it burst into life
(so to speak).

<h3>
CP/M 3
</h3>
<p>
There has been a little discussion on CP/M 3 in this magazine, together
with Mr Editor&rsquo;s thoughts on the matter. I know next to nothing about CP/M 3
except what has already been said in these hallowed pages. Now some of you may
be wondering why Map80 are supplying CP/M 3 when Gemini aren&rsquo;t. Well the
reason is simple (so I am told). CP/M 3 works with the MapRam, but Gemini
can&rsquo;t get it to work on their GM833 Ram Disk! Mind you, my source was rather
biassed... [Ed. &ndash; Yes, it was! Gemini could have supplied CP/M Plus (that is
its official name) some 18 months ago, when they had it running using multiple
GM802 RAM boards. However they decided that there would be insufficient
demand given the market at that time, and the costs (to the customer)
involved. With the arrival of the Gemini GM862 256K board I suppose there is
always an outside chance that Gemini may change their minds, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
hold my breath waiting ....]

Open Letter to Richard Beal &amp; Dave Parkinson
</h3>
<p>
In one of his book reviews, Rory said &ldquo;oh, for a book on CP/M using Z80
mnemonics!&rdquo;. Doubtless the entire disk-based readership of this magazine
agreed. So some on you two, you know more about CP/M than the rest of us put
together, so how about a Z80 CP/M book? (It could even be published by the 80-BUS
News Publishing Company Ltd Plc Inc...).
