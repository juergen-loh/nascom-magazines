APOLYDOS Version Of NasPen By Alan Melia
</p>
<p>
Because many Nascom users, who, like myself, started with cassette
systems, would have bought and installed NASPEN, it was felt that a POLYDOS
compatible version might be more acceptable than a change to say POLYTEXT.
Personally, being mean, and having spent my pocket money for this month, I
wanted to get my cassette text files onto this excellent disk operating
system. The advantage of POLYDOS is a good manual, with some very useful
examples of how to use the PolyDos subroutines, and a relatively simple guide
to producing purpose-built file-handling overlays. Armed with these tools and
a trusty Nasdis listing of my Naspen, I set to work to try and produce a
usable system.
</p>
<p>
First Naspen was copied to disk, and the ROM was removed to leave RAM at
B000 to BFFF. A careful investigation of the Nasdis listing showed that the
NASPEN command decoding table started at B999H. The table consisted of a three
byte entry for each command, the table being terminated by a catch-all jump to
a &lsquo;command error&rsquo; subroutine.The first byte is the ASCII value of the command
symbol,the second and third give the address of the routine to execute the
command (bytes reversed, of course). I determined to reallocate the &ldquo;R&rdquo; and
ty&rdquo; commands to the new disk routines to retain some compatibility with the
original usage. I further decided that I required to keep the cassette
routines to retain compatibility with several other local &lsquo;Nascomaniacs&rsquo;. A
skim through the handbook for Naspen will confuse by offering duplicate
commands for cursor-up and cursor-down, &ldquo;+ &amp; -&rdquo; as well as the normal cursor
keys. Thus I determined to replace the &ldquo;+ &amp; -&rdquo; with commands &ldquo;r &amp; w&rdquo; for
cassette read and write, and altered the &ldquo;R &amp; W&rdquo; entries in the table to point
to the new disk routines in the overlay. This means that only a simple patch
is required, rather than a full re-assembly job. A further modification that
was found necessary was to re-program the &ldquo;return to Nas-sys&rdquo;. The original
Naspen return reinitialises Naspen by jumping to 0000H rather than that well-loved
line, DF 5B. Unfortunately it was not sufficient to add the &ldquo;DF 5B&rdquo;
code, as the rentry to PolyDos leaves the keyboard in &ldquo;typewriter&rdquo; mode So a
few more bytes of code were required to reset &ldquo;KO&rdquo;. First, a seperate file
was written and debugged. This file contained the code nessessary to access
the PolyDos routines, and had to be loaded before Naspen was called. The ploy
</p>
<p>
_worked quite well, but flushed with success, I decided that it would be far
tidier if the extra file was loaded automatically when Naspen was called. The
proceedure used was to rename Naspen with an extension &ldquo;NP&rdquo; instead of the
more usual &ldquo;GO&rdquo; machine-code extension. An overlay routine was then written
and called &ldquo;NPfh.OV&rdquo;. The overlay program is loaded and executed automatically
when you type &lsquo;NASPEN&rsquo;.The overlay loads NASPEN at B800 and the extension file
&ldquo;NASPEX&rdquo; at B000. It then initialises the printer and cold-starts NASPEN.
The sequence of operations is then as follows:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
1) Call Naspen by typing &lsquo;NASPEN&rsquo; after the &ldquo;S"prompt
</p>
<p>
2) PolyDos sees that NASPEN has the extension &ldquo;NP&rdquo; so it loads the file
&lsquo;nPfh.OV&rsquo; into the overlay area (C800 onwards), and executes it.
</p>
<p>
3) NP&pound;h.OV loads the NASPEN file and the extensions &ldquo;NASPEX.GO&rdquo; and jumps to
the start of NASPEN at B800H. If this confuses, read the POLYDOS manual
on overlay file handlers.
