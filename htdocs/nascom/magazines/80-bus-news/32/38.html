RUN &ndash; Programs may be run direct from disk by just entering RUN followed by
the name of the program as stored in the disk directory. e-g- RUN"TEST&rdquo; will
load the program TEST from disk and proceed to run it.
</p>
<p>
TAB &ndash; As for ROM BASIC except that when additionally followed by two values
will print characters specified by the second value until the print head
reaches the column specified by the first value. e.g. PRINT TAB(20, 46)
assuming the cursor is placed on the first column of a line, will print twenty
</p>
<p>
full stops.
</p>
<p>
WIDTH &ndash; Sets the width of the current output device when an automatic CRLF is
generated. Set by default to 0 when no automatic CRLF is generated.
</p>
<p>
LOG &ndash; Followed by a suitable number returns the base 10 logarithm. The ROM
BASIC LOG command returns the natural (base e) logarithm.
</p>
<p>
LN &ndash; Followed by a suitable number returns the natural logarithm! _
</p>
<p>
And now the exclusive command set:
</p>
<p>
AUTO &ndash; Followed by up to two values. An automatic line numbering whilst
entering programs facility. e.g. AUTO 100,5 will start auto numbering from
line 100 in steps of 5. Default values are from line 10 in steps of 10.
Unfortunately you can fool this command by editing another line whilst in the
auto mode and then entering this new line. Although this line will be entered
correctly the next line number automatically printed will have increased by
the increment even though there has not been a line entered with the
previously printed auto line number. The only way to revert to normality is to
abort the auto mode by ESC and then issuing a new AUTO command. Absolutely
</p>
<p>
essential to program writing though!
</p>
<p>
CALL &ndash; Followed by a suitable expression will call a machine code routine at
the address specified. The routine should normally end with a RET instruction.
e.g. CALL &amp;C800 will call the machine code routine located at C800H.
</p>
<p>
DEL &ndash; Followed by two values will delete the XBASIC program lines between the
lines specified. e.g. DEL100,200 will delete all lines from 100 to 200
inclusive.
</p>
<p>
DRIVE &ndash; The default drive in the disk version is the disk drive A (logical
drive 0) and this may be altered with the DRIVE command. Any read or write
commands after this will default to the drive specified unless specified
otherwise in the command (see later disk commands). e.g. DRIVEB will now
default to the second disk drive. DRIVET will now read and write data to and
from tape when required.
</p>
<p>
ELSE IF ..... THEN ..... : ELSE &ndash; need anymore be said?
</p>
<p>
EVAL &ndash; I&rsquo;m afraid the usefulness of this command escapes me. The command will
evaluate text in a string expression. e.g. A$=""1+X-EXP(X/3)":Y=EVAL(A$).
</p>
<p>
FMT &ndash; Requires a lot of words to explain its detailed use but suffice to say
it is a PRINTUSING type of command which can specify the number of figures to
