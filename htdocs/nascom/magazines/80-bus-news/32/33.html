The heading also displays three things of interest. i) Whether the memory
buffer contains any data. ii) The type of EPROM currently selected. iii) The
name of the last file read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>written to/from the memory buffer. Items (ii) and
(iii) I find quite useful, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to program multiple
files into multiple EPROMs.

<h3>
The Int<span class="subtext">e</span>ligent Programming Algorithm
</h3>
<p>
The software implements the &ldquo;Int<span class="subtext">e</span>ligent programming algorithm&rdquo; (IPA) for the
larger EPROMs (<?php externalLink("2764"); ?> and upwards). For those of you that haven&rsquo;t met this, this
is a technique for vastly speeding up the programming of the latest EPROMs.
</p>
<p>
In general EPROMs are programmed by presenting the appropriate address and
data to the EPROM along with a suitable write pulse. (Certain &lsquo;programming&rsquo;
voltage levels have to be present on other pins.) The write pulse duration is
specified at 50mS. This figure of 50mS has to cover the worst case, and in
fact most data cells within an EPROM program in a fraction of this time (Intel
claim 16% of the time i.e. 8mS), and the difficulty lies is determining when a
cell is adequately programmed. With devices such as the <?php externalLink("2716"); ?> the resultant
programming time of about 100 seconds was not a burden, but 14 minutes for a
27128 is another matter entirely, (let alone 28 minutes for a 27256!). The
latest EPROMs have been designed and tested so that a (faster) modified
programming technique can be used, which still results in the same guaranteed
long term data retention characteristics. A simplified version of this
algorithm is as follows:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>1)</td><td>Set up the programming conditions and set Vcc=6v (rather than the usual 5v)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2)</td><td>Apply address &amp; data and set a software counter N=0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3)</td><td>Apply a 1mS write pulse. Set N=N+1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4)</td><td>Read back the data (with Vcc still at 6v) and compare with the original.<br>
		If it has not programmed go to 3 (unless N=15).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5)</td><td>Apply a pulse of 4NmS to complete the programming.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6)</td><td>Verify &amp; move on to next address.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
i.e. You try in stages until the byte is programmed, then you give it a final
big &lsquo;bash&rsquo; (4 x what you&rsquo;ve given it so far) to ensure that the cells are well
and truly past the threshold. The 6v Vcc level also ensures that the internal
threshold level that determines whether it is a &lsquo;1&rsquo; or a &lsquo;0&rsquo; that you are
reading is back is higher than normal. This gives an increased programming
margin that leads to increased reliability.
</p>
<p>
In practice I found that 2764s I was using programmed in about 90 seconds
using this algorithm.
