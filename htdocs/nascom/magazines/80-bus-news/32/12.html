1 &ndash; Move the bytes at #A21 to #A30 inclusive up to #A24 using the I command.
2 &ndash; Add the following bytes at #A21: B7 20 12.
</p>
<p>
3 &ndash; Add the following bytes at #A34: 18 E3.
</p>
<p>
The code should now look something like this:
</p>
<p>
getblock:
ld de,fcb
ld c,read seq
call jbdos
; New code follows
or a 3 set flags
jr nz,err 3; eof, so jump
; original code
1d hl,buffer
ld de,(arg1)
ld bc,128
ildir
ld (argl),de
; New code
jr getblock
; original code
err:
ep l
oe eet
</p>
<p>
This appears to work: I&rsquo;ve had no more problems since patching this in. I
also took the opportunity to change the bytes at #996, #9B5, #A50, #A65 and
#A8D to #C9. This changes the SCAL ZMRET codes to simple RET codes, and
enables the F and P routines to be called from user programs (eg the &ldquo;:&rdquo;
command in Zeap).
</p>
<p>
Now for the second problem: the P routine appears to &ldquo;hang&rdquo; when the disk
is full. The patch ain&rsquo;t so simple: it requires additional code on the end of
Monitor.Com, and where this goes will depend on where your particular copy
ends (I had tacked a printer driver onto the end of mine).
</p>
<p>
1 &ndash; Change the bytes at #97C to C3 xx xx where xxxx is some spare memory
after your Monitor.Com (the code here should look like this):
</p>
<p>
ld de,fcb
ld c,write seq
call jbdos
ep 0 3 Set error flags
jp z,write block
; Here if error &ndash; disk full &ndash; New code
jp full_error
; original code, no longer executed
</p>
<p>
eee
</p>
<p>
2 &ndash; Add the following code at address xxxx :
11 5C 00 OF 10 CD 05 00 CD 24 09 EF 44 69 73 6B 20 66 75 6C 6C 2E OD 00 C9.
</p>
<p>
The code should look something like this:
</p>
