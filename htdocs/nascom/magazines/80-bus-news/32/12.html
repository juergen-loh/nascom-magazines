1 &ndash; Move the bytes at #A21 to #A30 inclusive up to #A24 using the I command.<br>
2 &ndash; Add the following bytes at #A21: B7 20 12.<br>
3 &ndash; Add the following bytes at #A34: 18 E3.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
The code should now look something like this:
</p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-12-1.png"); ?>
<p>
This appears to work: I&rsquo;ve had no more problems since patching this in. I
also took the opportunity to change the bytes at #996, #9B5, #A50, #A65 and
#A8D to #C9. This changes the SCAL ZMRET codes to simple RET codes, and
enables the F and P routines to be called from user programs (eg the &ldquo;:&rdquo;
command in Zeap).
</p>
<p>
Now for the second problem: the P routine appears to &ldquo;hang&rdquo; when the disk
is full. The patch ain&rsquo;t so simple: it requires additional code on the end of
Monitor.Com, and where this goes will depend on where your particular copy
ends (I had tacked a printer driver onto the end of mine).

<p class="noindent">
1 &ndash; Change the bytes at #97C to C3 xx xx where xxxx is some spare memory
after your Monitor.Com (the code here should look like this):

<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-12-2.png"); ?>

2 &ndash; Add the following code at address xxxx&nbsp;:
