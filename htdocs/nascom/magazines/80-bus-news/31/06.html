<u>Dealing with RFI</u>
</h3>
<p>
I am glad to see that the
<a href="../../../25/55/text/#article1">problem of RFI</a>
is being considered seriously
(80-BUS News Vol.2, Iss-5) and delighted to learn that we may get an issue
devoted to Amateur Radio. For a starter, may I suggest the following
additional hints on the problem of RFI.
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis">
<li>A metal case to enclose your computer is vital. Mine came from a Radio
		Rally, custom-made out of l6swg steel except for a 1/8th aluminium front
		panel for #15. This vast box measures 19x14.5x9 inches and leaves a lot
		of room for all the expansion boards.</li>
<li>Multi-core screened cable for keyboard, printer and etc, may be obtained
		from Maplins whose catalogue may be read (and purchased) at W.H.Smiths.
		Screened cable is a must for stopping RF radiating from lovely aerials
		dangling from your computer.</li>
<li>Ferrite rings (try Ambit International) are effective. All leads (power,
		cassete, tv/monitor) emerging from your case to be wound a few times
		around the rings, as near as the case as practicable.</li>
<li>A mains filter (Ambit). This is effecitve both ways. It stops RF-escaping
		into the mains where the house wiring acts as a massive aerial
		and prevents the mains crud getting at your computer.</li>
<li>Desperate measure. In Wireless World, September 1983, G3NRW recommends a
		150 pF capacitor between the +12 V rail and ground.</li>
<li>Another desperate measure. Try earthing all your bits (computer proper,
		tv/monitor, cassette, etc) at only one point.</li>
</ol>
<p>
RFI appears worst for amateurs at 70&nbsp;MHz. I achieved a measure of
success for that band with some of the above, plus critical computer/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>radio
spacing and complete success by executing HALT! ON 144&nbsp;MHz, I have a few S1
whistles, but presently the lid is off the box and a Hobbit mechanism dangling
on an unscreened lead.
</p>
<p>
By the way, has anyone made <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal talk to the Hobbit?
</p>
<p>
Yours, G. Orford, Bristol.

Dear Dirtbags,
</p>
<p>
Oldsters, who are, like, total vacuum-heads and do not understand the
problems of a young person of today, often get the wrong idea about Waldo
&lsquo;D.R.&rsquo; Dobbs, who is like me, man. They think that I have no romance in my
soul, which is, like, this incredibly strange thing that I have inside my
body. To them I say: &ldquo;You are totally incorrect, man&rdquo;. It is, like, the
total lack of 80-BUS NEWS that causes these sauzzball manifestations, man!
Why, when I see these utterly horrible <span class="uppercase">Plastic Boxes</span>, I am, like, totally
overcome with emotion. There are these worthless diseased MOLLUSCS all over
the magazine stands in W.H. Nasties, reading about these disturbingly
repulsive micros, man.
</p>
<p>
Degenerate reptile, man, I ask you to stop this senseless deprivation of
<span class="uppercase">Real Computers</span> that you are, like, doing to me, man.
</p>
<p>
Monstrously, hazardously, like, yours, man.
</p>
<p>
Waldo &lsquo;D.R.&rsquo; Dobbs [No address given.]
