HIGH SPEED ARITHMETIC PROCESSOR
</p>
<p>
SPEED-UP YOUR PASCAL PROGRAMS
</p>
<p>
The HSA-88B floating-point arithmetic processor
is a 80-BUS/Nasbus compatible board which uses
a microprogrammed 16/32 bit microcomputer IC
which performs arithmetic and trigonometric calculations
10 to 100 times faster than the best
Z80 software routines. For example, a 32 bit
floating-point division takes just 90 microseconds
and a 32 bit arctangent executes in only 2500
microseconds. A large number of 16/32 bit
integer and floating-point functions from x+y
to x&rdquo; is accessible with simple single-byte commands.
All accesses to the HSA-88B are via two
I/O ports (selectable from 80H to F0H). The
HSA-88B is a true simultaneous co-processor
capable of performing one operation while your
Z80 CPU is doing something else. This is ideally
suited to animated graphics where the CPU, the
HSA-88B and the graphics card can perform
their functions at the highest possible speed.
</p>
<p>
The HSA-88B is easily used from within assembly
language programs. High level language programs
require a compiler with modified run-time

routines. We are offering with every HSA-88B a
FREE latest Hisoft HP5 Pascal compiler which
has been specially adapted to compile HSA-88B-oriented
code. This compiler is already extremely
fast and with the HSA-88B it outperforms all
other Z80 Pascal compilers, in many cases by an
order of magnitude. The standard Pascal variable
types plus 32 bit integers (ideal for financial
applications) are supported together with a full
range of maths functions rarely seen in Pascals or
Basics. The size of the run-time routines is greatly
reduced over other compilers because the HSA-88B
performs the arithmetic functions in hardware.

<p>
The complete package consists of the HSA-88B
processor card, HP5 compiler on Gemini 5%&rdquo;
DSDD disc (other formats available including
Nascom 5%&rdquo; and IBM 8" SSSD) and HSA-88B
and HP5 documentation and programming
examples. Package price &pound;268 plus VAT, UK
postage free. Not suitable for Nascom&nbsp;1.

NEW SUPER DISKPEN (PERVG:3)
</p>
<p>
DISKPEN has been rewritten and revised. This
popular text editor/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>formatter now includes a &lsquo;HELP&rsquo;
facility, and new features for the print control of the
most popular printers, underline, bold, ete (also
user patchable for the less popular types). New
features include block delete, better move commands,
new cursor control, optional hyphenation, visible
indentation setting and lots more. A major enhancement
is the ability to handle overlay files so that PEN can
use auxilliary packages such as the MAXIFILE free
field file searching utility or the print spooling
utility.
</p>
<p>
The new DISKPEN is useable on all Gemini
multiboard computers (Galaxy, Kenilworth, Quantum)
and Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini hybrids, (MAPPEN is available for

BDOSZ
</p>
<p>
Yes, you guessed it. Some enterprising person
has now &lsquo;disconbooberated&rsquo; the BDOS in CP/M and
rewritten it as a Z80 program. Its fully compatible with
the original with no buge found to date. Because it&rsquo;s
written in Z80 code it&rsquo;s smaller, this has allowed
reom for tidying up all the annoying stupids in the
original BDOS so that errors like:
BDOS ERROR ON x: R/O
which usually causes you to lose everything you&rsquo;ve
just done, becomes the far more helpful:
Disk x: is set R/O
Do it anyway? (Y/N/*C)
Which, of course, means you don&rsquo;t lose anything. It even
allows you to change disks when they are full without

ALLDISC VARIABLE DISC FORMAT UTILITY
</p>
<p>
ALLDISC fs a new approach to the problem of lots of
different machines all with different disk formats.
Designed for use with the Gemini and Nascom CP/M
computers, ALLDISC replaces the existing disk drivers
and the CP/M disk parameter headers from an archive of
different formats. Up to 6 drives and two controller
cards are supported, the drives may be a mixture of 8",
5.25 or 3.5" types in either single or double density
and may be single or double sided. 96 tpi 5.25" drives
can be made to &lsquo;double step&rsquo; to read and write 48 tpi
disks. The Gemini GM833 512K virtual disk RAM is also
supported. All this adds up to a very powerful system
where the drives fitted to the system may be
veconfigured to read and write disks of different
formats. The limitations are that the disks must be to
IBM3740 CRC standards and must be soft sectored (or in
other words, it will cope with most disks).
</p>
<p>
The archive is supplied with nine useful formats
when supplied, with others being made available to
resistered users free of charge for the first six months
from registration. The archive can be edited and new
formats created. Disks can be formatted from the
archive so there is no need for preformatted disks when
transferring software.
</p>
<p>
ALLDISC is supplied with full documentation and
hints and pointers to discovering unknown disk formats.
ALLDISC costs 172.50 ine VAT (150.00 + VAT).
