Next a minor bug but slightly more serious. Old habits die hard, and in some
C/80 source files I entered a few hexadecimal constants with a trailing &lsquo;H&rsquo;
(e.g. 0xAH rather than the correct 0xA). The compiler accepted these with out
comment and interpreted the &lsquo;H&rsquo; as part of the Hex number so I ended up with
an incorrectly evaluated constant. Finally my latest encounter has been with
an unforgiveable bug from Microsoft in an 8086 cross assembler. Being
relatively inexperienced in 8086-assembly language programming my initial
programs contained some glaring errors like loading a segment register with an
immediate 16-bit value. (Although you can load normal registers with immediate
data, the segment registers can only be loaded with data from another
register, or from memory.) The Microsoft assembler accepted my illegal
instructions without complaint, and proceeded to generate an opcode for a
completely different instruction. It was only by manually dis-assembling the
opcodes on the assembly listing that I found the error. (Luckily, as I was
just starting to familiarise myself with the 8086, the program was only some
25 lines long and it didn&rsquo;t long to find the error.)

One final comment on this topic &ndash; if you do find a bug REPORT IT, not by
complaining to your friends, but to the Author. Document the bug thoroughly,
for example by writing a four or five line program to illustrate it, and send
the print-outs in with your comments. DON&rsquo;T ASSUME SOMEBODY ELSE MUST HAVE
ALREADY REPORTED IT. You might find that your report vanishes into a black
hole, or, as I did with the Software Toolworks, get a polite note back and
find the bugs corrected in the next release of the software (C/80 version
3.0).

Next a request from Mr E.Jones for an article covering the general
principles of converting a domestic TV set to a monitor, and interfacing a
NASCOM to it. These sort of articles tend to be few and far between, and I
assume that the reason for this is that no magazine editor wishes to be sued
by the relatives of a late hobbyist who attempted to follow the article.
VOLTAGES INSIDE A TV SET OR MONITOR ARE LETHAL. If you do not know what you
are doing LEAVE THE BACK ON THE SET. If you think you know what you are doing
I still advise you to leave the back on the set. With the proliferation of
home computers and video recorders that has occured in recent years it should
be possible to pick up a cheap black-and-white monitor, or to buy a TV set
that already has a video input socket on the rear. For those who want to
progress further I offer the following suggestions/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>observations.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
(1) Before doing anything buy a copy of the service sheet or service manual
for the set in question.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
(2) Look at the power supply section of the diagram. Many sets directly
rectify the mains input and then use the filtered DC supply either directly,
(old Valved sets), or via a switch-mode step-down power supply (newer
integrated sets). Certainly in the first case, and possibly in the second, you
will find that one side of the TV chassis is connected directly to the NEUTRAL
of the mains supply, (or directly to the LINE side if the plug has been wired
incorrectly). In this case DO NOT PROCEED FURTHER unless you can isolate the
TV supply from the mains, or provide a suitable barrier at the video interface
into the TV. (A small black-and-white portable offering mains/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>battery
operation will almost certainly have a mains transformer providing the
required isolation.)
</p>
<p class="noindent">
(3) The signal present at the VIDEO pin on the Nascom&nbsp;2 circuit board is a
convential composite video signal containing a mixture of Video and the
horizontal and vertical sync pulses. This is similar to the signal present at
the output of the detector following the IF stages in the TV. I haven&rsquo;t looked
