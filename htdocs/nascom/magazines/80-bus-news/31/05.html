Re:C.B. A-K-A- Dr-D

In a recent hard-copy interchange with that super-programmer, peerless
hardware hack and expert wine connoisseur Chris Blackmore, the subject of
software exchange loops cropped up. Chris suggested I write to you and deal
directly &ldquo;with the Mafiosi who have a firm grip on the throat of 80-BUS NEWS&rdquo;
concerning non-CP/M exchange loops. Right, here goes.
</p>
<p>
My N-l (yes, there are still a few around!) is fitted with a GM805 disk
drive and runs D-DOS (boo, hiss, boo), DCS-DOS and POLYDOS. I am currently in
disk-to-disk contact with one Alan Wood Esq of St Mellons, Cardiff, using both
DCS-DOS and POLYDOS. If an exchange loop exists for either or both of these
DOS formats, would you put me (us) in contact with the organisers.
Alternatively, if said loops do not exist you could direct any interested
parties my way and I&rsquo;ll have a bash at setting a loop (or loops) going, &ldquo;like
wot yer doc. did for CP/M&rsquo;. Ah, fame at last.
</p>
<p>
I will start an exchange loop, and I will also name it unto youe And it
will be called ..... TOROID FERRUGINOUS, the greatest software exchange in the
history of time and space (or, the biggest anticlimax EVER).
</p>
<p>
Another point raised in conversation was the inordinately long time taken
by 80-BUS to cough up the readies for articles published. Now I know that 99%
of the contributors who write to you do so just to see their names in print
and/or to help other readers. But please take note, C.B. and D.G.R. DO IT FOR
VER MONEY!! Why do you think Chris Blackmore makes home-brew wine? It&rsquo;s
because he&rsquo;s too poor to visit the local wine bar, okay, ya&raquo; And my Nascom
rusts in the corner &lsquo;cos, &ldquo;cos, I can&rsquo;t afford to pay yer &ldquo;lectric bill. And
all this just because you employ a disslexic, er, dislexic, um, diss--lexik
accountant who doesn&rsquo;t know how to sighn, er sign a cheque!. I&rsquo;m seriously
thinking of trading in my Nascom ..... for an I.B.M- 370!

Happy hacking, DG. Richards, 29 Martin Crescent, Tonyrefail,

Re. Easicomp Board
With regard to Mr A Brown&rsquo;s information on the Easicomp Sound Board, in
</p>
<p>
part 2 of your I/O map (Vol.2, Iss.4), please note that, although the manual
states that ports 10 and 11 (decimal) are used if NASIO is provided, I find
that the board actually decodes ports 130 and 131 (82H and 83H). I assume
</p>
<p>
from this that Easicomp changed the design of their board at some point, and
</p>
<p>
hence boards of both types exist. Incidentally, in common with the PSG design
published in INMC 80 News, Issue 5, I now use ports 8 and 9!
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for printing the &ldquo;Nascom ROM BASIC Dis-assembled&rdquo; articles!
Although I had dis-assembled this previously, the added documentation is very
helpful.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the contents of your magazine, I feel you are leaving many of
your readers behind by printing lengthy articles on very specific topics. This
is an unfortunate side-effect of the flexibility of an 80-BUS system. What
about including a short questionaire as part of your subscription form, to get
a better idea of what equipment people own?
</p>
<p>
On a different note, I would be interested in Doctor Dark&rsquo;s program
exchange idea, assuming you have had replies from anyone else interested in
using tapes. While on the subject of software, I notice that you have been
publishing very little software and even fewer software reviews. Is this
because no-one is writing programs for the Nascom anymore?
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, Kevin Smith, Aberdeen.
