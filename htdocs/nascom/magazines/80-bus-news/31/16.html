Below is a simple program written in BASIC-80 which, if present on two
machines fitted with the EV Computing
<?php externalLink("EV814","IEEE488 interface",""); ?>, will allow data files
to be transfered between them at a reasonable rate. The speed loss is due to
the amount of data conversion done in BASIC, but it is still faster than
serial interface methods previously used. Shortly a machine code version with
more features will be made available which will be able to transfer files very
fast indeed (approaching 200&nbsp;K bytes a second). The speed limitation then will
be in the disk drives and not in the software or interface.
