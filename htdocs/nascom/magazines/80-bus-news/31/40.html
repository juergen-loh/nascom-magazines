<h3>
NASCOM(?) 1.5(?)
</h3>
<p class="noindent">
Finally a letter from Steve Waites which I reproduce below:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Back in the dark annals of history I had a perfectly good and working
Nascom&nbsp;1 +
<?php externalLink("RAM A","RAM&nbsp;A"); ?>
card. Simple but effective. Then I left to work in America so
the poor old computer got left behind. Two years later I returned, and found
that the old Nascom had pined itself away to an early demise. Checking the
boards I found several of the 2102 RAMs and a few TTL chips had gone to the
great semiconductor heaven. In desperation, and because I only had two weeks
in England, I grabbed all the relavent software and made the decision to
rebuild and upgrade. Several months of hard effort later I now welcome the
Nascom&nbsp;1.5. Why 1.5? Well its no longer a Nascom&nbsp;1, nor is it quite a Nascom&nbsp;2.
My additions are an enhanced RS232 port, 18K of CMOS RAM on the main board
plus 4118 RAMs for the video and user areas. Oh yes it also has a sound chip,
a battery backed RAM area, graphics, and the memory is fully decoded in 2K
blocks by a 74LS154.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So far so good &ndash; everything works wonderfully &ndash; now to my question. Is
there anyway that I can get my ZEAP (level 2.1 in ROM) to output continuously
to the UART port as I usually use my computer with a slave CRT connected to
the RS232 interface rather than the internal video. Also, but not quite so
important, I have the Bits &amp; PCs programmers toolkit. It won&rsquo;t accept commands
from the remote CRT keyboard. Both Nas-Sys and BASIC have no problems in this
respect, so what is the difference?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps some of you ZEAP hackers can write in with a solution for Steve.
I believe that ZEAP writes directly into the bottom line of the NASCOM
display. This is done for speed, as outputing a character at a time via Nas-Sys
would have an impact on the already slow assembly speed of ZEAP. How much
of ZEAP&rsquo;s output goes this way I have no idea. As for the Bits &amp; PCs toolkit,
this uses its own input and output tables, and also utilises UIN and UOUT. I
assume that a small error must exist in this somewhere which prevents it
scanning the serial input port. Perhaps some enterprising person who is using
the toolkit can send in a suitable patch that can be published in a subsequent
issue of the NEWS?
