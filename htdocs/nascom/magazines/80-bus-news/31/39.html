error. The INT input to the Z80 is level sensitive. i.e. While the /INT signal
is low an interrupt will occur immediately interrupts are enabled. I cannot
conceive of how the /INT pin could be reasonably used to measure the <u>duration</u>
of pulses. (The only thing that comes to mind is a service routine that starts
EI, NOP, followed by code that counts the number of return addresses that have
been pushed onto the stack by the successive interrupts&nbsp;&ndash; hardly a practical
proposition.) The situation with the NMI input is virtually the same. The only
difference is that it is an edge triggered input. The NMI is generated on the
high-to-low transition of the signal on this pin and the low-to-high
transition has no effect. Therefore a program could collect statistics of the
frequency of occurrence of the pulses, but could not determine anything about
their duration. Neither pin is suitable for the measurement of pulse widths.

3) Try the PIO.

<p>
The obvious canditate for this task is the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>. It can be set into mode 3
(control mode) and the levels present on one or more of the external inputs
can be monitored by the control software. But before anything can be done we
need to know something about the characteristics of the pulses that are to be
monitored. Obviously if they are very short (of the order of luS) and very
frequent there is no way that the Z80 can be used for this purpose. Pulses of
milliseconds or seconds duration can be measured relatively easily, but a few
calculations should be done to determine the relative accuracy obtainable, and
whether it is acceptable.

A simple timing loop could be:<br>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-39-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
With this there is obviously an uncertainty equal to the software loop
time in determining when the pulse goes OFF. (It could go OFF just before or
just after the IN instruction is executed. In the latter case another complete
loop is executed although the time difference between the two cases could only
be nanoseconds.) Similarly there can be a similar uncertainty in recognising
the ON instant. The basic unit measurement here is the &lsquo;LOOP&rsquo; (above) and we
can measure to an accuracy of +/&nbsp; 2 LOOPS.
</p>
<p>
The above is a very simplified view of matters as there is also the
problem of measuring the intervals between pulses. (Note also the above loop
assumes that a 16-bit counter is adequate as the loop counter. For long pulses
this is unlikely to be so, and the loop will have to be expanded to include an
overflow check of the counter. However, as the pulse is longer, we can accept
a greater absolute error as the relative error will still probably be small.)
</p>
<p>
The only thing to do is to sit down and write some of the software and
start counting clock cycles. You may find it advantageous to add dummy
instructions into some conditional paths so that all routes from point A in
the software to point B take about the same amount of time. That way a
software timer-counter can be updated with a fixed number to compensate for
the execution of a particular service routine. (e.g. The routine that takes
the last pulse measurement and updates a histogram table based upon the pulse
width in &lsquo;loop counts&rsquo;.)

<p>
Life may be easier if you use an I/O board which includes a <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC", "CTC"); ?> (Counter
Timer Circuit).
