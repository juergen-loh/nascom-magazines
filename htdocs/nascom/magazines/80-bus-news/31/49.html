yourself). RAVEN then becomes a cross-assembler for the <?php externalLink("6502","",""); ?>. Other uses for
this powerful macro facility would be to add extra instructions to the Z80,
e.g. LD (HL),HL etc. Or if you are involved in a particular field of interest
such as robotics, music or graphics, then you could write your own personal
programming language where each program instruction would in fact be a macro
name. RAVEN then effectively becomes a compiler for your new language.

<p>
One notable ommission from the Z80 library was the NAS-SYS restart
instructions. They can be easily added by writing a few extra macros using the
methods described very clearly in the manual. The comma in the jump
conditional instructions was missing, and as I was used to putting it in, I
altered the macros accordingly. Another much more serious error was only
discovered after spending many hours puzzling over apparently perfect programs
which would just keep on crashing. The problem was that the assembler was
allowing relative jumps up to +/&nbsp; 255 instead of +129 to &minus;126. So, for
instance, if the jump was between +130 and +255 the error would not be
detected and the byte put into the object code would in fact work out to be a
negative jump and the program would therefore crash. I managed to overcome
this problem by rewriting the macro definition dealing with relative jumps.
Being rather surprised that this problem had not been spotted sooner, I wrote
to the author, so he is now aware of it.

<p>
At first you might think that there has to be a macro definition for
every possible permutation of instruction (about 750 I think), but RAVEN
provides facilities for much more concise definitions so that each instruction
&ldquo;type&rdquo; (e.g. 8-bit register load) may be defined by one macro. The parameters
supplied to the macro determine the machine code generated. It is necesary to
read the manual to fully understand the method, but I will give an example
which may give some idea. e.g. the macro to define 8-bit register to register
loads:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-49-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;LD&nbsp;,&nbsp;" is the name of the macro. The asterixes show the position that
the parameters must be in the macro name (separated by a comma in this case).
R8 stipulates that the parameters must belong to a previously defined set, R8,
which is a set of the 8-bit register names A to L and A is assigned a value of
7, B a value of 0 etc. DB is the define byte pseudo-op. #0 and #1 refer to the
first and second parameters respectively. The expression thus generates the
required bit pattern according to the registers specified (see the Z80
Technical Manual for a breakdown of the bit patterns). e.g. for LD A,B the
expression is evaluated like so:
</p>
<table class="macsum">
<tr><td></td><td>40H:</td><td></td><td>01000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>(Reg A = 7)</td><td>#0*8:</td><td></td><td>00111000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>(Reg B = 0)</td><td>#1&nbsp;:</td><td></td><td>00000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><?php hline("100%"); ?></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td></td><td>01111000</td><td>= 78H</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
There are also several <span class="uppercase">Pascal</span>-like control structures for the generation
of loops within macros. These may be used for the production of data tables.
e.g. a macro to clear a block of memory of any size:
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
