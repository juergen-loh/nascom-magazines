With the advent of either black and white high-res or colour graphics
perhaps some enterprising software writers will have a go at writing some
arcade type games for the Gemini and Nascom hybrid machines. These would have
to written for fun as there would be little money in it, but it is surprising
how often we get asked about games for the Gemini. There are a number of the
more intellectual type, Adventure, Chess, Planetfall, etc., but the arcade
types tend to get overlooked. I know I personally have no patience with arcade
games, both lacking in the necessary co-ordination to play them and also in
the necessary patience to practice. I also realise for the cost of a Climax
card (now Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM837","",""); ?>) I could buy a Spectrum and a whole bag full of Space
Invaders tapes. But some people seem to want them and where there is a need
someone will usually try to fill it.

<u>Qwikdraw</u>
</h3>
<p>
Whilst still on the subject of colour graphics, the expensive
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
card (now only available in the full 8MHz, extended monitor form) has gained a very
versatile graphics package shortly to be made available by Gemini. Called
Qwikdraw, and written primarily for use on the Gemini networks installed in
the Manpower Services YTS training scheme, Qwikdraw is an easy to use graphics
package with some very novel features. Input is either from the keyboard
(using the cursor keys with selectable step rates) or, ultimately, from a bit
pad. Drawing of graphical displays is quite easy with automatic circle and
smoothed curve creation. Block and complex shape fills and colour floods are
also catered for. An optional colour mixing package will allow up to 32
colours to be displayed, and a &lsquo;picture compiler&rsquo; which can convert the stored
picture format into a .COM file for immediate execution. Limited animation is
also possible. Display is normally to a high resolution colour monitor or to a
dot matrix printer or to a multicolour plotter. Very extensive &lsquo;help&rsquo;
facilities are provided, which are an education in themselves with animated
graphics demonstrating the points queried. One interesting use demonstrated
was the preparation of the cels used for overhead projectors in an educational
environment. The cels being drawn on the plotter using oil based pens. Whilst
not as versatile as the Nascom Lotti, it is extremely quick and easy to use
with a powerful editor, it should find lots of applications outside the YTS
scheme particularly in the education field.
