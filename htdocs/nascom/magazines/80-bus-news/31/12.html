Again, labels will be substituted for addresses in look-up tables.

<p>
7. On-screen editing using the cursor controls is available on all line-inputs
to MDIS.
</p>
<p>
8. MDIS works with XSUB. (One in the eye for DISZILOG).
</p>
<p>
9. Allows tables of data area addresses and types to be redirected to come.
from a text file on disk. This facility may be combined with input under
XSUB.
</p>
<p>
10. Sereen paging is available if required but not to SYS standards. (Who
</p>
<p>
needs both?)
11. MDIS allows printed listings to be stopped after each page so that single
</p>
<p>
sheet paper may be changed.
</p>
<p>
12. Margins may be specified on all output listings so that mounting in ring
binders is possible. A unique feature enables alternate pages to have
margins so that if single sheet paper is in use, both sides may be used.
</p>
<p>
13. Listings are formatted so that data areas are separated from code by a
blank line to improve readability. Additionally, blank lines are also
inserted after JP (ss) instructions and any unconditional jump, jump
relative or return instructions.
</p>
<p>
14. MDIS decodes NAS-SYS&nbsp;,restarts correctly.
</p>
<p>
15. Disassembles right up to FFFFH and will not overflow to 0, unlike many
</p>
<p>
: other disassemblers.
</p>
<p>
16. MDIS allows selected portions of the object program to be disassembled (a
useful subroutine for example) and will produce a stand alone program for
</p>
<p>
reassembly.
17. MDIS permits the user to enter titles and subtitles which will be used on
</p>
<p>
page headings or after the appropriate pseudo-ops on Macro-80 source
</p>
<p>
files.
18. The user is allowed to define his own edit keys (even on systems without
</p>
<p>
user defineable keys on the keyboard).
</p>
<p>
19. MDIS will accept a printer initialisation string to be entered for ease
of use.
</p>
<p>
20. A user subroutine area has been included for those special initialisation
jobs (like redefining the numeric keypad as cursor controls on the Rotec
keyboard &ndash; a routine to do this is provided free).
</p>
<p>
21. MDIS works on ANY system running CP/M-80 [properly!!! Superbrains don&rsquo;t
like it. &ndash; Ed.].
</p>
<p>
At #50, MDIS surpasses all other CP/M disassemblers in both performance
and price. Too good to be true? Most of the Microvalue Dealers will provide a
</p>
<p>
free demonstration to callers on request. Finally, those of you who have
versions 2.1 or 2.2 will know that MDIS was protected against disassembling
</p>
<p>
itself and against copying to other systems. In spite of the possibility of
rip-offs, version 2.3 has had these checks removed for two reasons. Firstly,
it was causing problems for some dealers where some computer manufacturers
didn&rsquo;t serialise their CP/M systems properly and second, I was feeling
hypocritical as how do you think I obtain those pieces of software that I
</p>
<p>
don&rsquo;t write for myself.
