<u>RAVEN</u>
</h3>
<p>
At #30, RAVEN is the most expensive of the three and about the same price
as ZEAP. However, when you see the sort of things it can do, I&rsquo;m sure that you
will agree that it is an excellent piece of software and quite reasonably
priced at that. The TDK tape has the assembler itself on one side and the Z80
macro library on the other (see later for an explanation of the macro
library). The manual is a loose-leaf ring-binder and has been printed directly
by a dot-matrix printer. Unfortunately, the paper used is a bit thin and the
holes are punched close to the edge so after a few hours&rsquo; use the holes tear
and you literally have a loose-leaf manual! Raven takes up about 16K of memory
and it does not perform any text compression (apart from the use of TABs to
save spaces), so 32K RAM is needed even for a fairly small program.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to interface RAVEN to your own system, in particular a
printer routine, optional form feeds, cursor character code and repeat speed,
and finally the start address for the source code. The adapted version may
then be saved on tape and used as the working copy. The many facilities
available on this assembler are well explained with clear examples. The only
ambiguity I came across was the procedure for attaching your own printer
routine. It didn&rsquo;t work for me so I had to devise my own method.

<p>
The editor is one of the best features of RAVEN. It is a full screen
editor and I have found it to be far superior to the usual line-based editor
that is supplied. The screen is best thought of as a 48 character by 15 line
window on the text file, which is moved around the file by the cursor keys.
Because any part of the file may be viewed at any time just by using the
cursor keys, line numbers are not necessary. Lines can be up to 255 characters
long but this is probably too long for most uses. An option of 80 (or 132)
characters would be useful since this would be the same as most printers.
</p>
<p>
There is a comprehensive range of commands, selected by a single letter:&ndash;
change and insert text, find and replace strings, delete and copy lines or
blocks of text. As well as read, write and verifying of named files, it is
possible to join a file from tape to one already in memory so that you can
build up the source program from library files (for example). Tabs may be
positioned anywhere along the 255 character line width and you may have as
many as you wish. If you forget the function of a particular key, the Help
command will give a short description. However it is usually necessary to
consult the manual anyway since most commands have several options which
require further input. It was while I was playing around with the help
facility that I discovered a command that was not mentioned in the manual,
this was to &ldquo;update tabs&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been trying it out but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to do
anything useful!
</p>
<p>
The top line (line 16) is used to display information to the user. Cursor
position is given by column number (1 to 255) but I would also like to have
seen line position so that you would have a better idea of what part of the
file you are at. This display may be changed to give the length of the file in
bytes. Other information is displayed during tape transfers, and string
search/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>replace etc.

<p>
Whereas assemblers for micros usually have one fixed instruction set,
RAVEN does not have any instruction set built in at all. Before it can be used
as an assembler it has to be supplied with the instruction set for the
particular CPU. All instructions and most psuedo-ops are defined as macros.
The list of macros defining the instruction set is treated just like any other
source file, however for normal use it can be incorporated into the assembler
semi-permanently so that it is loaded into RAM along with the assembler. The
instruction set supplied is, of course, for the Z80 but you could just as
easily replace it with say a 6502 set (although you would have to write this
