with this improved display speed is that fingers 2 and 4 on my left hand had
to increase their reaction time by a proportional amount, as there was barely
time to bash ^S before the thing you wanted to see disappeared off the screen.
Perhaps a ZZzzz... command could be built into CCPZ to slow it up when not
actually executing a program.

<p>
The next feature investigated (for its novelty) was the clock display.
Once enabled, a changing clock display is written at a user predetermined
cursor position on the screen. The default cursor position is the extreme top
right hand corner of the screen, and this suits most software I had a chance
to try it with. The internal clock generator is interrupt driven from the
frame sync., which is divided by 50 to update the clock counter and redisplay
the clock once a second. As the system clock is crystal controlled, it is
accurate enough for most purposes although I think reprogramming the 6845
video controller could upset the clock accuracy. A very simple routine was
written which read the time from the GM822 RTC and loaded the clock on the
SVC. At the end of the two hour period there was a discepancy of 7 seconds
between the RTC and the SVC clock.
</p>
<p>
A number of bits of software which were known to be to greater or lesser
extent video card dependant were tried to see if the compatibility between the
GM832 and the now discontinued GM812 were as claimed, and all were found to
work as before. DISKPEN/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GEMPEN required adjustment to the cursor speed patch
byte, because the cursor flash rate went berserk, but in all other respects
except the 48 wide mode (the new SVCs second screen mode is now 40 wide)
DISKPEN/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GEMPEN worked well. The increased speed of the card showed to
advantage with WORDSTAR, screen rewrites being accomplished with very
acceptable speed. My old CHARGEN program for reprogramming the character sets
worked, but of course needs rewriting in the light of the SVC as there are now
two programmable character sets (total 256 characters) instead of one.
</p>
<p>
The SVC has a number of new features including 256 by 256 pixel graphics
with built in line and circle drawing software, selectable attributes for
flashing characters with low, half and inverse intensities, inputs for serial
keyboards, and many other things. As I said, I only laid hands on one for a
very short period, so it is very difficult to be objective. I didn&rsquo;t find any
nasty quirks and the board behaved impeccably. Perhaps now Gemini will loan me
&ldquo;one to play with, and I&rsquo;ll be able to find out what it can really do. The only
thing that worries me though is the very high degree of sophistication of this
card, commensurate with its elevated price. In my experience, 99% of users
were unaware of the potential of the old GM812 card, so is all this cleverness
really necessary?

<h3>
The Climax colour card
</h3>
<p>
The Climax colour card is to be re-introduced. Gemini have acquired the
rights to manufacture the card from Climax, and deliveries are to commence
very shortly. This card was very popular with those owning it, and some very
clever displays have been seen. But as the card has been unavailable for the
best part of a year, interest in it has waned. With its welcome reappearance
perhaps some new and clever software will start to be written. Certainly as
the video format of the Climax card is the same as the high-res mode of the
new SVC, there will be demand for a piece of software which will act as an
interface between the two. Here is an opportunity for CC-SOFT, who have
written some rather nice graphics software for Gemini gear in the past to come
up with something. It would be nice to see two interfaces with common inputs
