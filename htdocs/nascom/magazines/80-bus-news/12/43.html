<h4>
Pascal&nbsp;&ndash; The Language and its Implementation, ed. D.W.Barron,<br>
published John Wiley 1981
</h4>
<p>
This is collection of papers on the subject of the programming language Pascal and
the problems of its implementation. Some of the papers have been previously
published, but are not elsewhere available. This book substantially arises from the
proceedings of a symposium on the same subject. It carries a reprint of Niklaus
Wirth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pascal-S: A Subset and its implementation&rsquo;, which is useful as a complete
example of a compiler for study.

Programming Language Translation, by R.E.Berry<br>
published Ellis Horwood (distrib. John Wiley) 1981
</h4>
<p>
In this volume, Berry deals with the problems of translating the source language
into the version of the program which can be understood by the target machine. The
author gives the text of the Pascal S compiler in toto, and makes lavish use of this
in his discussions, concluding with the most useful blow by blow account of the
purpose of each proceedure, and the uses it makes of the various data structures of
the compiler in the organisation of the code. I would recommend this book over the
preceeding for those who are interested in getting an idea of what happens (and how)
in a compiler.

<h4>
Pascal Programs for Scientists and Engineers, by Alan Miller,<br>
publ. SYBEX
</h4>
<p>
This is a collection of assorted programs in Pascal which may be of use to people
handling data or figures. It is a well laid out and very readable book, but quite
expensive, so one ought really to see it first before buying it, to make sure that
you needed it. The programs given include Mean and Standard deviation, Vector and
Matrix operations, solution of simultaneous Linear equations, curve fitting,
sorting, integration, Bessel functions, non linear curve-fitting. It does not
(unfortunately!) include a Fast Fourier Transform, which is a pity.

<h4>
Software Tools in Pascal, by Kernighan and Plauger,<br>
publ. Addison Wesley 1981
</h4>
<p>
Further to
<a href="../../../11/33/text/#article1">my notes</a>
in the last 80-BUS News, I have now received a copy of this. It
is a revision of the earlier book, Software Tools, using Pascal as the language of
implementation rather than RATFOR and PL/I. In doing this, it gains in readability
and ease of application. Its philosophy on the construction of a series of tools of
general application, which are well documented and modular, so that any maintainence
or modifications are easy to implement, has been one of the most outstanding
breakthroughs of the last decade. Nobody who has read these authors has been
unaffected by their approach.

<h4>
Pascal Implementation, by Daniels and Pemberton,<br>
publ. Ellis Horwood (John Wiley),
</h4>
<p>
This is a fully commented listing of the P4 Pascal assembler, complete with the
necessary interpreter to run the compiler. It does not, contrary to my impressions
from the advance publicity, list the Pcodes produced by the compiler compiling
itself. In consequence, it would be necessary to cross compile the compiler on
another machine, having a full Pascal implementation. The source for the P4 compiler
takes up in excess of 160&nbsp;Kbytes, so cross compiling on a micro-computer will be
difficult, to put it mildly.
