Well it had to happen, four episodes and all I get is fan mail, I had to go
and blow it on the fifth now didn&rsquo;t I. Yet, strange, only two letters and one phone
call to tell me. Either no one out there is reading this rubbish, or no one out there
understands it, or you are all so poor (having taken out a second mortgage to buy the
darned thing in the first place), you can&rsquo;t afford a stamp. Well, having been caught
by the way B2HEX worked half way through writing the last episode, I wasn&rsquo;t thorough
enough in checking the thing myself. When making use of tricks to do useful things in
programs, I said you needed to know exactly how an instruction worked, and then
proceeded to waffle on about how the DAA instruction went about its &lsquo;doings&rsquo;. Got it
wrong didn&rsquo;t I?. Made it up from what I thought it did, didn&rsquo;t I? Didn&rsquo;t look in the
<?php externalLink("Zilog"); ?> bible, did I? Oh what the heck, I made a dogs&rsquo; breakfast of it and now I&rsquo;ve
proved what I said in the first episode, that I&rsquo;m not qualified to write this stuff
anyway. Call that an excuse? Yeah!! Want to make something of it?
</p>
<p>
So it&rsquo;s sackcloth and ashes time, I consulted the Zilog bible (not the little
one in the Nascom manual, the big fat &lsquo;Zilog Programming Manual&rsquo;), and intoned one
hundred times as a penance, &ldquo;The DAA instruction works as follows ......&rdquo;. Now I must
impart the truth and explain exactly how it does work. Fortunately (for me) the
remainder of my description of the B2HEX routine is correct, even down to the
introduction of the ADC 40H as a &lsquo;fiddle factor&rsquo;. It was only the way the DAA dealt
with it which was wrong.
</p>
<p>
So here goes. Firstly, the invisible &lsquo;Half Carry&rsquo; flag is not affected by the
DAA instruction itself, in fact, it is the preceding arithmetic instruction which sets
the H flag for the DAA instruction to use. The instructions which affect the H flag
are ADD, ADC, INC, SUB, SBC, DEC and NEG. The DAA instruction works conditionally in
the following manner:
