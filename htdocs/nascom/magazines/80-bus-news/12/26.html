As you can see the philosophy is simple, and presents no problems to the programmer.
</p>
<p>
Now onto the bits in detail, from the above, it&rsquo;s obvious we need three
workspaces, one to hold the word, one to hold the letters tried and one to hold the
number of trys taken. We also need two others, a three byte workspace for the RANDOM
routine (which must be primed with three numbers, any numbers), and space for the
program stack.
</p>
<p>
In order then, the workspace &lsquo;RING&rsquo; is the workspace for the RANDOM routine,
it is primed with the numbers 01H, 02H and 03H, although so long as this work space
contained any old rubbish it wouldn&rsquo;t matter (it&rsquo;s random after all). The only thing
the RANDOM routine doesn&rsquo;t like is if all three workspace bytes are 00H.
</p>
<p>
WBUF is the &lsquo;word buffer&rsquo;, this must be one byte longer than the longest word
it is expected to hold, so this is what limits the word length to 9 characters, and
subsequently allows me to indulge in a nice fiddle of which more anon.
</p>
<p>
TRYS is the one byte store where we keep count of the number of trys taken. To
simplify matters, the contents will be in packed BCD, as we are hardly likely to
indulge in more than 99 trys.
</p>
<p>
Next comes the &lsquo;letters tried&rsquo; buffer, CHRTRD, which will be the maximum
number of trys plus one long. Now in the system equates I defined the maximum number
of trys, NTRYS, as being 12H (HEX, as the comparison will be done in packed BCD, 12H
is the representation of 12 in packed BCD), therefore if we make the length of CHRTRD
equal to NTRYS in HEX, it&rsquo;s got to be longer than the maximum number of trys without
us having to worry exactly how long it is, let the assembler take the strain, that&rsquo;s
what I say.
