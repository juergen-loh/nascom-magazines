Writing Interactive Compilers and Interpreters, by P. J. Brown<br>
publ. John Wiley
</h4>
<p>
All fans of Professor P.J. Brown will be happy to know that the latest edition of
his most readable guide to the complexities of compiler design and construction is
now available in a paperback edition, at a most reasonable price reduction on the
hardcover edition.

<h4>
Pascal from BASIC, by P.J.Brown,<br>
publ. Addison Wesley 1982 (cost approx &pound;5 in paperback)
</h4>
<p>
This book has recently appeared on the bookstands. This author&rsquo;s work will need no
recommendation to those who have read his previous work, mentioned above. This new
book is a detailed and extensive guide to the problems of converting from BASIC to
Pascal &ndash; which is a problem that will confront more and more microcomputer users as
time goes by. In this book, in his usual humorous way, Professor Brown discusses
very fully the different approach needed to write successful Pascal programs from
that used for BASIC. He is alive to the advantages of Pascal, but does not hesitate
to deal with its disadvantages as well (Gasps of horror.. surely Pascal can&rsquo;t have
any? Well, Heloise, you are a big girl now, and there are things you should know. Of
course these are only talked about in the proper place (not in front of BASIC
programmers)). In dealing with the language, he deals with the &lsquo;standard&rsquo; Jensen and
Wirth Pascal, which is substantially that proposed for the ISO standard. In
restricting his discussion to this definition of the language, he is able to avoid
heavily system dependant and non-standard extensions, referring you for these to the
detailed manual which has been supplied with your particular implementation (we
hope). The book is illustrated with comparative examples of Pascal and BASIC
programs, with humorous cartoons as chapter headings. The book is well printed and
typeset, with only three misprints coming to my notice. These were on page&nbsp;81, line
7 of text, which should read
</p>
<pre class="indent">
ecount['p',true] {p' omitted}
</pre>
<p>
and line 35 of text, which should read
</p>
<pre class="indent">
for row:='a' to 'z' do {z' omitted}
</pre>
<p>
and page&nbsp;134, last line, which should read
</p>
<p class="indent">
score:1..50;{a dartboard etc} {. omitted}
</p>
<p>
In the course of the book, he makes helpful hints to the would-be Pascal programmer,
with sound advice on how to approach the problems of writing a program, and useful
little points of style to help overcome some of the infuriating syntax errors of
Pascal. For example, did you know that you don&rsquo;t preceed an ELSE with a &lsquo;;&rsquo; in an IF
THEN ELSE construction? I know that it is in the syntax diagrams, but I hadn&rsquo;t
realised that it could be as formally stated as that!

Without any reservation, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to the would
be user of Pascal, more particularly if he is trying to convert from BASIC. Because
of the language similarities, it will not be irrelevant to those of us who learned
to program in FOR&shy;TRAN II (They are now at FOR&shy;TRAN 77 or 80, so you can figure out
how long ago that was!). I think that in writing this book, which is light and easy
to digest, but not trivial, Prof. Brown has done a service to the microcomputer
fraternity, having written a very valuable contender for the title of &lsquo;Computer Book
of the Year&rsquo;. He might even end up being mentioned in our prayers, along with
Niklaus Wirth!
