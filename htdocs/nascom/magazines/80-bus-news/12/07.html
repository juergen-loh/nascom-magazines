This piece of information may well be common knowledge among the wiser
Nascomers, but I feel sure that many people will be glad of it.
</p>
<p>
The USR routine to scan the keyboard under Nas-Sys&nbsp;3, given in Appendix I of
the Nascom BASIC manual, only detects the initial pressing of a key, and returns a 0
if the latter is subsequently held down and the routine re-run. The solution is to
load the keyboard repeat counter (KCNT) with 1, before calling the input routine
RKBD. The subroutine becomes:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-07-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p class="continued">
In BASIC, this is:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-07-2.png"); ?>

<u>EPROM Erasers &amp; IMP ribbons</u>
</h3>
<p>
A cheap alternative to forking out &pound;40 odd for an EPROM Eraser is the
ordinary UV Sunlamp. Having no idea whether the power or UV frequency would be
suitable, I did some experiments and found that 20 min at 1&Prime; from the UV bulb did the
trick. The lamp I used was the small Boots one and this has 2 IR heating elements
which are an essential part of the circuit and cannot be disconnected. To avoid the
EPROM being cooked I mounted it on a wet sponge and directed a fan at it &ndash; These
measures kept the EPROM fairly cool. Some experiments will probably be needed, as the
lamp may differ from mine. I can&rsquo;t guarantee the EPROM won&rsquo;t be damaged by heat but
they are cheap enough to take the risk &ndash; I have now erased mine many times without
trouble however.

Does any reader have any information on how to re-ink ribbons for the
<?php externalLink("IMP","Imp"); ?>
&ndash; i.e. type of ink and where it can be obtained? (I know it can be done with the
correct ink despite the manual recommending this is not attempted). Incidentally I
note that the article in INMC&nbsp;80-4 on
<a href="../../../../inmc-80-news/04/58/text/#article1"><span class="uppercase">Imprint</span></a>
mentioned oiling the cam. I believe
this may be inadvisable since ordinary oil can cause the nylon to distort. My
interpretation of the manual is that only IBM&nbsp;22 or equivalent grease should be used
on the nylon bits (oil is OK on the metal rail). I had trouble in getting this
locally and got it direct from the Great IBM (Greenford) by post.

alteration is B15B.
