DUMP is a utility program for PolyDos 2.0. It is used to
output hex listings of disk files to the printer. To run
DUMP, use the following command line:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
$DUMP filename heading
</pre>
<p>
where filename is a PolyDos file name (drive and extension
are optional), and heading is any string of ASCII characters,
seperated from the file name by at least one blank. Each line
output shows the address of the first byte (starting with
0000H), then<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>the values of 16 bytes in hex, and finally the
same values in ASCII, if they are printable. Note that as
the lines are 72 characters wide, the minimum printer line
width is 72 (48H).
