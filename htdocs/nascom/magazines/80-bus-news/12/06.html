<u>PEN &ndash;2</u>
</h3>
<p>
This small routine will enable NASPEN users to indent any text from the left
hand margin without having to insert the indentation directly into the NASPEN buffer.
It does this by detecting all CARRIAGE RETURNs (0DH) sent to the printer
(<?php externalLink("IMP"); ?>
assumed) and printing a pre-determined number of spaces before returning to NASPEN.
The code can be placed in any convenient part of memory. For those with IMPRINT, code
02 (bi-directional printing) can also be trapped when it occurs at the end of text.
This allows unidirectional printing to continue till the IMP print buffer is empty.

Enter the routine into memory, say at &pound;0C80, then change the NASPEN printer
reflection to jump to the routine. i.e. modify &pound;101D (DF 6B C9) to C3 80 OC. The
indent can be changed by loading B with the required number of spaces. Then warm
start NASPEN.
