number of spaces, these are contained in a message and displayed in the normal way
through SNDTXT. Now to display the word, this is done in a similar fashion to the one
already described in LOOP4. The only difference is that each character is tested to
see if it is flagged. Bach flagged character is &lsquo;visible&rsquo; so it is ANDed with 7FH to
strip the flag and then displayed directly, each unflagged character is replaced by a
&lsquo;.&rsquo; which is displayed instead. A space is placed between each character. When OO is
detected, the loop cops out in the normal way, and a call made CRLF2 to send two
newlines. After that the program jumps back to LOOP3 to start the whole process again.

Well that just about wraps up that program, with the above comments and _ the
liberal sprinkling of comments all over the program itself, you should be able to
follow it. Now to improvements, well obviously if you have an assembler you can
reassemble the whole thing into it&rsquo;s right places for either NAS or CP/M versions. If
you&rsquo;re going to have a go at the NAS version, then might I suggest that you put the
ORG at 1000H as you could unwittingly end up with problems if you extended the words
table from its current end at 0FFCH. You see, NAS-SYS corrupts the bytes 0FFEH and
0FFFH during its &lsquo;E&rsquo;xecute procedure as it uses them as intermediate stack space, so
if you had data in those two bytes then some funny things could happen. There is no
easy way of making the program avoid those bytes so best to reassemble the whole-lot
above it. If you&rsquo;ve got an assembler it implies that you aren&rsquo;t stuck for RAM space,
so what the odds. The words table may be extended to 255 words (the largest random
number that can be generated), make sure NOWRDS contains a count of how many words
there actually are. There is scope for tidying up the displays although the method
used here was chosen so I didn&rsquo;t have complications with the output routine. In fact
it was deliberately made a simple as possible. I remember my handwritten version kept
the screen in one place and didn&rsquo;t scroll. It achieved this by moving the cursor about
and overwriting the text for each successive turn round the loop. There is one version
in Basic I&rsquo;ve seen which incorporates some spectacularly gruesome graphics, complete
with swinging man and stretchy rope. Lot&rsquo;s more fun to do in assembler. People
reassembling this for a NAS regime could save quite a bit of space by dispensing with
the input/output patches and calling B2HEX direct from NAS-SYS. As should be apparent
B2HEX had to be included in the program as there is no CP/M equivalent within the
system.

IT hope that you&rsquo;ve noticed that by feeding all input and output through simple
user patch areas this program could be made to work with very little modification on
almost any Z80 based machine. It could also be modified fairly easily to run an any
8080 based machine simply by substituting absolute jumps for the relative jumps I&rsquo;ve
used (and modifying the one or two DJNZ loops used). This technique of providing user
patches is going to play an ever more important part in programs published in this mag
due to the diversity of machines we intend to support in future. So if you are
thinking of writing a program for inclusion in the library then keep in mind that
flexibility is the name of the game, and user patches will become very useful.

Note that the RANDOM routine works completely stand alone, all it needs is its
three byte work space and to be fed with the maximum number to pick. I&rsquo;m told this
particular routine is very nicely random, quite a bit better than the ones found in a
good many Basics.
</p>
<p>
So here endeth the lesson, as I said, I haven&rsquo;t tried it under a NAS regime,
but it should work. I know it works under CP/M, and as it only uses two system calls
it has no excuse for failing under RP/M. The 3K waste space penalty is &lsquo;a nothing&rsquo;
when used with disks, for the RP/M tape types, sorry, but it takes about 45 seconds to
load when it should only take 4 or 5. I hope you will have a go at it, and that it
gives you as much fun getting it to work as it gave me in writing it.
