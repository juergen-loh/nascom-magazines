EDITORIAL
</h1>
<p>
Welcome to Issue&nbsp;2 of 80-BUS News.
</p>
<p>
We have been very pleased to receive all of the letters congratulating us
on the
<a href="../../../11/01/text/#page">first issue</a>.
It is obviously very encouraging that so many people have taken
the time to comment on the format and content of the magazine and we will endeavour
to make some of the modifications that have been suggested.
</p>
<p>
There have also been, inevitably, one or two letters with an amount of
criticism, but this criticism has been mainly aimed at the inefficiency of the
<a href="../../../../inmc-80-news/text/#head">INMC80 magazine</a>,
which we have, as you know, taken under our wing. Steps are being
taken to rectify the shortcomings in these areas, as we are well aware of them. One
problem has been in maintaining an accurate mailing list, as until now this has
been handled manually. We are about to take a somewhat retrograde step and
computerise!! This will mean some considerable fun during the changeover period and
we would ask you to have a little (lot of?) patience as we move the sizeable
mailing list from paper to disk.
</p>
<p>
Another complaint has been at the irregularity of issues. Well, again we
know, we apologise, we have had a little hiccough at the start, but we have made a
promise to produce a given number of issues within a given time period, and this we
will do&nbsp;!! (We will, we will, we will.)
</p>
<p>
In the last editorial I commented on the amount of material we had received
(and published) on disk systems. Well, there seems to have been a natural reaction
to this, and this magazine escapes with hardly a word about disks. (Well, nearly.)
But there are articles about disk systems arriving for the
<a href="../../../13/02/text/#article1">next issue</a> already, so
anti-disk readers had better get scribbling quickly if they want the magazine to
maintain a nice even balance&nbsp;! We have also received a couple of hardware articles
and so
<a href="../../../13/01/text/#page">Issue&nbsp;3</a> is well underway.
</p>
<p>
A number of people have written asking &lsquo;Whatever happened to the INMC
program library?&rsquo; Not an easy one this. The program library was, to put it mildly,
too successful. Vast numbers of programs used to arrive at the INMC, with no-one
with the time to even look through then, let alone sort out which of the 27
versions of Hangman, or 18 versions of Life was the best. In addition some programs
arrived hand-written, or as carbon copies, or printed on an arthritic antique
teletype, or on Nascom&nbsp;1 format tapes (single or 3.83642 times speed!), and even
the occasional Nascom&nbsp;2 tape (which was about the only promising media, until it
was discovered that the sender had forgotten to plug in the cassette lead and all
that was there was Joey the budgie saying rude things). All in all a disaster. Then
one day a volunteer was found to sort it all out (mad fool) and so off he went with
van-fulls of paper and tape ...... never to be seen again (not so mad). And that
brings us almost to date. So, in answer to this recurring question, all I can say
is that we do hope that one day we will be able to resurrect the library, but in
the meantime, please don&rsquo;t call us.........<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>(P.S. Anyone seen the van driver?)
</p>
<p>
One popular item in this sort of magazine is the review. If anyone has
purchased any software or hardware that they think everyone else should either buy
or steer well clear of, then please send us a review. (We pay, you know?)
</p>
<p>
And finally a little glimpse into a few items that we hear may actually
have appeared at last, or may appear in the next few weeks. Anyone who manages to
find any of them please write in to let us know if they work! I/O Research&rsquo;s

<?php externalLink("GM822"); ?>

comments to make on Nascom&rsquo;s N3, Gemini&rsquo;s Galaxy 1, EV Computing&rsquo;s IEEE488 or
