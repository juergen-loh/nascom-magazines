Some of the purchasers of my Double Precision Package (DPP) extension of the
Nascom ROM BASIC (marketed by myself at _ ________ __, London ____ and also by
Business &amp; Leisure and the Microvalue group as &ldquo;MathsPak&rdquo;) have pointed out that it
does not support the INPUTing or READing of double precision constants. As things
stand, double precision constants can only be entered as a numerical constant in an
expression to be evaluated by a call to the DPP. This is inconvenient when it is
required to enter a large quantity of double precision conctants.

Although I now recognise this to have been an error on my part, it was
originally a conscious decision to leave out INPUT and READ facilities as
non-essential when trying to minimise the memory requirements of the package. I had
intended that INPUT and READ could be implemented in BASIC rather than as part of
the M/C package and thus would occupy no space when not required. However, the BASIC
routane required is rather longer than I anticipated and it would probably, with
hindsight, have been better to include it in the DPP from the start. Still, for
those of you who wish to see such a routine, here it is:
