The book comes in two volumes, one of 160 pages comprising the notes and commentary,
and one of 82 pages comprising the listings of the compiler and interpreter. Due to
currency differences, I cannot give an exact price, but it is expensive &ndash; say in the
&pound;22 (sterling) region. I think that it would not prove very valuable to the average
microcomputer user &ndash; I&rsquo;d suggest P.J. Brown&rsquo;s &lsquo;Writing Interactive Compilers and
Interpreters&rsquo; or the same author&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pascal from BASIC&rsquo; as being of more general use.
If you are interested in the design of compilers, then a detailed study of one of
the important modern compilers for a modern structured language may well prove
enticing. See it first! After all &pound;22 is a lot of money for a book, even in this
inflationary age. A note in the book says that machine readable versions of the
source programs are available from the publisher. These would be of interest if one
had access to a larger machine to cross compile the compiler, subject to
compatibility of formats and pricing. Most probably the source will be available
only in professional tape and floppy disk formats.
