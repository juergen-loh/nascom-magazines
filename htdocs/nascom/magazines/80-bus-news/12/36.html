Colour your Computer Green (for envy?) by D. R. Hunt
</p>
<p>
What to date has been much speculated upon, is highly colourful, and so far
has remained completely invisible? What is it, that by the time you get round to
reading this, you should just about be able to rush out and buy? (At least don&rsquo;t
blame me if you can&rsquo;t.) What is he talking about? (Does he ever know what he&rsquo;s
talking about?) Of course, it&rsquo;s the Nascom Advanced Video Card!!
</p>
<p>
At a recent Nascom dealer meeting it was there in all it&rsquo;s glory, and for
the first time we were allowed to poke it a little bit. No, they weren&rsquo;t generous
enough to donate one to a worthy cause (me) so what follows is a description of what
it is and what it does rather than a review of how good (or bad) it is.

First impressions are certainly good, and it could prove itself extremely
useful in the educational field and, to a lesser extent (as far as the colour
graphics is concerned), in the business field. The business area will be much more
interested in it&rsquo;s 80 x 25 screen format. For the home user, well I don&rsquo;t know. I
still maintain that any colour graphics is a facility that most could do without and
on balance, will remain without. Although the initial cost is modest, there are
hidden overheads. For instance, in the average home there is only one colour display
device, the TV, and the only reason that your home computer is allowed in the house
at all is because the &lsquo;Mrs&rsquo; is able to sit in front of the box watching Coronation
Street, whilst you play with your toys. Suggest that the colour TV should be
connected to the computer instead of the aerial, and you, the computer, the newly
acquired colour board and any other bits of your assorted iron-mongery, are liable
to find themselves out in the street. The alternative, buy another colour TV. But if
you are going to do that, then, realising that the rotten performance of a colour TV
connected to a colour computer is almost all down to the poor bandwidth of the TV
colour demodulating circuits (for a TV picture it doesn&rsquo;t need to be better than
about 1.5MHz), then, why not a colour monitor. You then find that what was once a
relatively cheap colour facility has turned into a wallet depleting demon, at a cost
of several times the original cost of the computer. Some home users will do this.
But I think the majority will stay with playing Space Invaders and Galaxians in
black and white. Perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong, it remains to be seen.

What does it consist of and how does it work. Firstly it should be made
clear that except when used with CP/M business type systems, Nascom consider the AVC
as a peripheral rather than the main display device. This means that two monitors
are really required, although the Nascom video output can be directed through the
AVC if required. If two monitors are used, a B &amp; W one would be used for displaying
the programming details from the standard Nascom video, and a colour one to display
the colour results. This is a useful scheme and one commonly adopted in colour
software development. Anyway, the AVC itself is best considered as three planes of
dynamic RAM arranged one above the other. The video controlling being achieved by
Motorola MC6845 CRTC processor. Each plane is 16K and each plane deals with one of
the three primary colours. Each plane is identically memory mapped to the screen in
a similar fashion to the existing video RAM is mapped to the screen on the Nascom.
The only difference that need concern you is that there is 16K of video RAM in each
plane as opposed to the 1K of RAM in the Nascom. Using 16K of RAM allows a
resolution of some 390 dots horizontally and 256 dots vertically. For full colour
use, the three planes are effectively placed in parallel, providing three outputs
one representing RED, one representing GREEN and one representing BLUE. If these
output were fed directly to what is known as an RGB monitor (that&rsquo;s one with three
inputs, one red, one green and one blue), then that&rsquo;s all there is to it. On the
Nascom card further options are allowed, the RGB signals may be fed to an optional
PAL encoder and then to an optional high bandwidth UHF modulator to provide a
composite UHF TV signal. There is also a monochrome (B &amp; W) monitor output.

On the monitor screen, the RED output lights up the red dots, the GREEN
output lights the green dots, etc. Additive colour mixing takes place on the screen,
so that if, for instance, the RED and BLUE signals were on together then a sort of
