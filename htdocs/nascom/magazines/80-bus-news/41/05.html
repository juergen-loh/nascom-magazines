first time was missed} then it just so happens that the
string 1B 1B corresponds to the &lsquo;List/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Edit<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>...&rsquo; request.
</p>
<p>
For information and interest, let&rsquo;s just consider what
would happen the other way round (i.e. keyboard is
GM827/GM852, but IVC/SVC is set to GM821). The
software is not looking for double-byte codes anymore,
and so all function keys, plus the ESC key, will result in
two characters being received, a 1BH plus another
character. In particular, the ESC key will return 1B 00, and
this will result in the correct action being taken for the
ESC, but the 00 will put the system into Edit Mode. At the
wrong time this may be disastrous! (N.B. The Gemini
BIOSs have always allowed the Edit Mode code to be
redefined if required, and the latest versions (V3.2 and
later) allow it to be disabled altogether.
</p>
<p>
I hope that the above is useful (and understandable!).

BBC BASIC (Z80)
</p>
<p>
In the &lsquo;Letters to the Editor&rsquo; in the July &ndash; August
1984 edition of 80-BUS News (Volume 3, Issue 4),
mention was made by Chris Hellen of-Colchester of
a BBC BASIC (Z80) for Z-80 based microcomputers
including those of 80-BUS construction. This BBC
BASIC was written by R T Russell and marketed by
M-Tech of Norwich.
</p>
<p>
Please may I ask if you know the full address of
M-Tech of Norwich, from whom further details of
BBC Basic (Z80) might be obtained?
</p>
<p>
Yours truly, lan Manning, Bristol.
Ed. &mdash;- Most Gemini dealers should be able to obtain this
</p>
<p>
for you, and in particular I do know that Off-Records in
London deal extensively with this product.

Dear Editor (etc, etc)
</p>
<p>
Hello, John. It&rsquo;s me again, ANGRY of Tonyrefail
{remember!).
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve just read (and re-read) with great interest the
VERY LATEST issue of 80-BUS News &ndash; July/Aug
1984.
</p>
<p>
What I want to know is, what&rsquo;s all this talk of
</p>
<p>
-printing my favourite 80-BUS oriented magazine
</p>
<p>
on a &lsquo;regular-as-clockwork&rsquo; type basis (Ed&rsquo;s comments,
bottom of page 4). Look Tosh, if one wants
one&rsquo;s reading matter delivered regularly, one could
buy a subscription to PCW or Practical Computing
or any one of the numerous other &lsquo;pulp&rsquo; mags.
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, one of the best features of the good
ol&rsquo; 80-BUS is the sense of nerve-tingling expectation
one gets from wondering just exactly WHEN
the next issue will flop through the letter box. With
other mags. one starts to think &ldquo;July is here, I can
hardly wait for this month&rsquo;s issue of XYZ magazine
to arrive!&rdquo;. But when one has a subscription to
YOUR particular rag, one usually thinks &ldquo;July is
here, I wonder WHEN the March issue of 80-BUS
will arrive??!&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
if you proceed with your threat to print 80-BUS
News regularly, I will CANCEL my subscription!!
</p>
<p>
The regularity of 80-BUS is analogous to the
general condition of most people&rsquo;s Nascoms, ie,
&ldquo;Will 80-BUS be printed this month?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Will
my Nascom work when I switch it on&rdquo; (sez it all
really, doesn&rsquo;t it!).
</p>
<p>
Now to something totally different. Please inform
Roger Dowling who&rsquo;s running a Users&rsquo; Group for
NasDos that I DEMAND an immediate retraction of
his statement on Page 6 of this issue of 80-BUS &mdash;
&ldquo;The PolyDos Users Group only has 6 members&rdquo;.
Let it be known to all, said Polydos Users Group
now has a total membership of 8 (or 17 if you count
everyone twice. Now I NEVER said maths was my
strong point!). If Mr Dowling does not wish to
retract his grossly inaccurate statement, please
inform him that I am quite willing to be persuaded
by a generous donation to my favourite bank
account.
</p>
<p>
Oh heck, is that the time! If I hurry [ll just have
enough time to flog a few peasants before lunch.
</p>
<p>
Yours truly, Dave &lsquo;Head-Crash&rsquo; Richards, Tonyrefail,
South Wales.

<p>
More Logic&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
Thank you for printing my article on Lucas in
80-BUS, Vol 3 No 4. Logic (Ilogic?) have sorted out
my MDISK and XBASIC problem. I wrote to the
General Manager (Mr Peter Seddon) who prodded
the Engineering Manager (Mr Phil Purssell), who
passed it on to John Phoenix. This last (untitled!)
chap updated my XBASIC master disk for me, and
MDISK under XBASIC is very nice, thank you very
much. But who pays for all my postage?
</p>
<p>
The moral of the story:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
If you&rsquo;re having troubles in an illogical way
And your letters are being chucked into the
bay
</p>
<p>
Don&lsquo;t mess about with the bottom of the tip
Climb every mountain
</p>
<p>
And give Peter Seddon a lot of lip
</p>
<p>
Apologies to Mr Seddon, but it&rsquo;s been a year of
nearly wasted programming!
</p>
<p>
Yours truly, Dr David Plews, Keighley, W Yorks.
