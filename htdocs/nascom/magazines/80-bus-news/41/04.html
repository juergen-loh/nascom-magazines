<h3>
Turbo Pascal &ndash; 2
</h3>
<p>
I have installed <i>Borland International</i> Turbo Pascal
onto my <i>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom</i> system. With the <i>Nascom</i>
video (generated using MOVCPMN) the
system works perfectly, but when trying to use the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
(Version 1.0), the system hangs after trying to
edit a file. Other commands work perfectly and it
appears to be only when cursor addressing is used.
Have you come across this problem before or can
you suspect a cause?
</p>
<p>
By varying screen size that the Pascal recognizes
(from 10 x 20 thru&rsquo; 25 x 48 to 25 x 80) and varying
the delays generated after the cursor addressing, I
can vary the time between invoking the editor and
hanging occurring. By this I mean the number of
characters typed. I would appreciate any help.

Ed. &ndash; Well, Mr Lea, you can either apply the modification
suggested by Mr Gibson above, or you may like to get to
the source of the problem. Version 1.0 of the IVC-MON
(which was not in production for very long) did not
support any nested escape sequences. Later releases, as
well as including a number of enhancements, have been
modified so that certain sequences, including cursor
addressing, can accept nesting. The differences between
releases of IVC-MON were
<a href="../../../32/48/text/#article1">published</a>
in 80-BUS News
Volume&nbsp;3, Issue&nbsp;2, pages&nbsp;48 and 49, in an interesting
article giving an insight into the hardware and software
design philosophy used in the development of the <i>Gemini</i>
<?php externalLink("GM812"); ?>
IVC, and its successor, the
<?php externalLink("GM832"); ?>
<?php externalLink("SVC","",""); ?>.
You should find, as should Mr Gibson, that replacing your
IVC-MON V1.0 with any later release will eradicate your
problem.

An IVC Problem?
</h3>
<p>
I have recently come across an intriguing problem
with WordStar when used on a system which
incorporates IVC-MON 2.0 and the keyboard is
attached to the
<?php externalLink("GM812"); ?>
video card. If the ESC key is
pressed (as may be necessary if an error or
interruption occurs), a List/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Edit Function key
message is produced &ndash; not much use if you haven&rsquo;t
got the appropriate keyboard and a <?php spChar("starf"); ?><?php spChar("starf"); ?><?php spChar("starf"); ?><?php spChar("starf"); ?> nuisance
as well since the system may lock-up and
often has to be cold booted to clear the problem.
</p>
<p>
I am currently running SYS and can have the
keyboard attached to the CPU card or the IVC. By
attaching the keyboard to the CPU card, the ESC
key functions normally and WordStar does not
become confused. If a version of SYS is not used,
link 3 on the IVC will need to be adjusted so that the
keyboard can be used on the CPU card.
</p>
<p>
Yours truly, Dr P D Coker, Orpington, Kent.
</p>
<p>
Ed. &ndash; the clue to your problem lies in the fact that the
keyboard works OK on the CPU board, and not on the IVC.
Firstly, why use it that way round anyway? I cannot think
of any advantage to that approach, and a definite
disadvantage is that you lose the type-ahead buffer.
Secondly, I bet that you have a
<?php externalLink("GM821"); ?>
keyboard, and that
you don&rsquo;t get the &lsquo;List/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Edit ....&rsquo; message until you have
pressed the &lsquo;ESC&rsquo; key twice, right? To explain what is
happening I&rsquo;ll just give a little history on <i>Gemini</i>
keyboards.
</p>
<p>
First of all came the GM821 keyboard (very originally
known as the G613). This has 59 keys and can, with
various permutations of Normal, Shift, Control, and
Shift/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Control, produce 128 ASCII codes, thus using 7 bits
of the interface. The 8th bit is used as a strobe, and the
keyboard can be connected to the keyboard interface on the
<?php externalLink("GM811"); ?>
CPU,
<?php externalLink("GM812"); ?>
IVC and GM832 SVC boards.
When <i>Gemini</i> decided to produce the
<?php externalLink("GM827"); ?>
keyboard,
with 87 keys, some of the keys were used to obviate the
necessity for the Shift/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Control permutations. In addition
30 keys were added to be user-definable separately in
Normal and Shifted modes. These obviously require
additional codes, but with only 7 bits available the
question was &lsquo;How?&rsquo;. The answer was to make therm all
double-byte codes, and to pick one existing code as the
first byte &lsquo;key&rsquo;. The one chosen was the ESC key, code
1BH. This key was therefore redefined as the first in the
double-byte sequence, 1B 00, and all of the function keys
carried on from there, F0 = 1B 01, F1 = 1B 02, ... and so
on. The IVC-MON (Version 2.0 and later) was modified to
include support for these codes. One of the user
selectable links on the IVC (one of the switches on the
SVC) determines whether the keyboard to be used is the GM821 or
GM827/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?><?php externalLink("GM852","",""); ?>.
(The GM852 is a low-profile
version of the GM827 with the only differences being that
it is also available in a serial version, and that the very
latest ones extend the user-defined keys into the Control
mode as well.) If GM821 is selected then the code is
passed on directly, if GM827/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GM852 is selected then all
codes are passed on directly unless a 1BH is received, in
which case it waits for the next code and translates it to
the user-defined string held in its workspace RAM.
</p>
<p>
And so back to Dr Coker&rsquo;s problem. If the IVC-MON (or
SVC-MON) believes that the keyboard is a GM827/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GM852,
but it is in fact a GM821, then when the ESC key
is pressed the keyboard outputs the code 1BH, which tells
the IVC-MON that this is a special case, and that another
code will be used to select a user-defined string.
Consequently nothing will happen until another key is
pressed, and depending on what this is will determine
what the IVC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SVC actually passes onto the system. If this
is the ESC key again (being pressed in the belief that the
