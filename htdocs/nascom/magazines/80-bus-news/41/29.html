to see if a global variable with the name
$MEMRY has been declared. If $MEMRY
exists, then L80 will set it to point to the first
byte of free memory following the program.
The code below gives a simple example of its
use and contrasts it with the straight forward
approach.
</p>
<pre>
single assembly  multiple assembly
                 entry $memry   ;Define Entry point
 ......          ......
ld hl,buffer     ld hl,{buffer} ;Point at memry buffer
ld a,(hl)        ld a,(hl)      ;Load byte
ld hl,buffer+128 ld hl,(buffer) ;Point at byte
                                ;128 in buffer
                 ld de,128
                 add hl,de
 ......          ......
 ......          ......
                 $memry equ  $   ;$MEMRY same as BUFFER
buffer equ $     buffer defw 0   ;Define buffer
</pre>
<p>
The basic difference is that &lsquo;buffer&rsquo; becomes an
indirect reference to the buffer area. There is
no real difference in the code when loading
HL with a pointer to the base of the buffer
area, {one just becomes an indirect load), but
the irritation is when you want to load the
address of a specific location offset within the
buffer area. In the former case the assembler
has already done the calculation for you, and
you are still only loading HL with an immediate
value, while in the latter case you have to
explicitly do the calculation in your own code.
</p>
<p>
Happy hacking!

Converting WordStar text files
to improve their readability
</h2>
<h3>
by P.D.Coker
</h3>
<p>
One of the problems associated with using WordStar
is the lack of clear legibility of the text files it
produces, unless they are being edited by WordStar
itself. This is perfectly all right on most
occasions, but there are times, particularly when
deciding to delete or dump a lot of text files, when
the tedious business of loading them into Wordstar,
reading and then exiting, is a bit too much
trouble. Using the TYPE command in CP/M gives a
visually disturbing result with lots of inverse video
characters at the end of words and no nice tidy
paragraphs. [Ed. &mdash; this is not true of CP/Ms
installed with CCPZ, i.e. all Gemini Winchester
based systems, and all Gemini CP/Ms of BIOS 3.0
or later.] This WordStar &lsquo;feature&rsquo; is also not
particularly good if you wish to use PEN on a file
originally written using WordStar, since the formatting
commands used by WordStar are totally
different and a lot more time will have to be spent
deleting them and substituting the appropriate
commands for PEN.
</p>
<?php nowrapEnd(); ?>
<p>
The strange characters which WordStar inserts are
used for justification, tabulating and other formatting
functions and they are not normally displayed
on the screen when WordStar is in use.
Characters such as these have ASCII codes greater
than 127 (dec.) and are interpreted by the video
controller in an 80-BUS system as inverse (black on
white) letters or symbols. Normal text and some
other symbols used by WordStar have ASCII values
from 0&nbsp;&ndash; 127, and the formatting commands will
not interfere with these.
</p>
<p>
There are two approaches to this problem. One is
to use the [Z] option in PIP which sets the parity bit
to zero; the following command line will read the
text file B:RUBBISH.TXT and produce a cleaned-up
version on drive A as GOOD.TXT:
</p>
<pre class="center">
A&gt;PIP GOOD.TXT=B:RUBBISH.TXT[Z]
</pre>
<p>
This works nicely because the eighth bit is set to 1
in characters beyond 127 and these are the ones
which cause the peculiar effects. The drawback to
using PIP/[Z] is that you cannot see the edited file
unless you call it up by using the TYPE command.
There may be various tweaks to the PIP command
which will produce a listing on the CON: function
&mdash; in this case, assigned to the CRT: device, but I
haven&rsquo;t investigated these, and the thought of
typing extended PIP command lines (I haven&rsquo;t got
a programmable set of function keys on my
machine) didn&rsquo;t appeal!
