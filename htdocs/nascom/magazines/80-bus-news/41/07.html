THE DH BITS

In this section of miscellaneous ramblings, the
always verbose David Hunt looks at copying files
via dBASEII, changes that have occurred in
different versions of dBASEII, disk sector skewing,
disk blocking/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>deblocking, how to expand a <i>Nascom</i>
based system, a tip on using the Pretzel
program, and a look at the Gateway and Pathway
programs.

Speeding up dBASE II using RAM-disks
</h4>
<p>
Following on from my other article concerning
adding machine code patches to dBASEII, a new
routine has had to be written lately. So this bit is for
dBASE aficionados, although it contains a warning
for all who would write simple file copying
routines.
</p>
<p>
Now those who know dBASE will know the
geriatric performance it puts in when indexing files
with a good few thousand records. Far too slow on
a floppy disk, somewhat better on a Winnie and
just reasonable on a RAM disk. Further, versions of
dBASE earlier than V2.41 get very slow when
updating files with multiple indexes.
</p>
<h4>
An aside about dBASE V2.41
</h4>
<p>
By the way, dBASE V2.41 has what appears to be
horrific change of philosophy which I believe has
led to its rapid replacement with the current
version, V2.43, so anyone with version 2.41, watch
out when trying the following:
</p>
<pre>
@ x,y GET input
READ
FIND &amp;input
DO WHILE input=record
(... do your thing ...}
SKIP
ENDDO
</pre>
<p>
What all versions of dBASE, except V2.41 do, is that
the FIND function finds the first occurrence of the
find criteria, whilst the DO WHILE &ndash; SKIP loop then
finds all following entries where the input and
record criteria match, the loop cops out when the
criteria no longer match. Basically it works through
a matching list in order of entry until it no longer
matches. V2.41 is something different. Using the
same routine, the FIND will find the first occurrence
as before, but for some unexplained reason, it then
sets the record pointer to the end of the list, so the
following DO WHILE &ndash; SKIP loop will immediately
find the next record does not match and cop out.
The way round it is to rewrite the program:
</p>
<pre>
@ x,y GET input
READ
FIND &amp;input
DO WHILE input=record
(... do your thing ...)
SKIP -1
ENDDO
</pre>
<p>
In this case it appears to almost work backwards
through the list (almost, as the first record found is
still the first in the list), not a disaster, and in many
ways more convenient as it&rsquo;s more often than not
the last in the list you&rsquo;re looking for, not the first.
But what about all the programs written for other
versions of dBASE, they&rsquo;re incompatible!!
</p>
<p>
To tell the truth I didn&rsquo;t find this, Trevor at ACC did,
when it screwed up an invoicing program I had
written. He phoned me to discover what special
feature it was that I&rsquo;d added to the latest version of
the program that didn&rsquo;t work. I started investigating!
I assumed this was a new feature of V2.41,
and you now had the option for either backwards
or forwards search (very useful), but I could find no
reference to it in the manual and no way of
switching back to &lsquo;normal&rsquo;. As I said, V2.43
followed hot on the heals of V2.41, and that works
&lsquo;normally&rsquo;, so perhaps the V2.41 anomaly was
considered as a bug. To be fair, I only had one copy
of V2.41 to test, and this was replaced with V2.43,
so perhaps it was a corrupt disk or something,
although I&rsquo;ve yet to hear of a corrupt disk causing
a complete change in philosophy, corrupt disks
usually crash.
</p>
<h4>
And so back to the indexing problem.
</h4>
<p>
Now lets take the real life situation, it&rsquo;s a stock
control program working on a <i>Gemini</i> with a 10M
Winnie. The main stock file has something like 2000
records in it and the transaction file has about 6000
and increases with each stock movement. The
stock file has three indexes all on at once, whilst the
transaction record is indexed by date and the
paperwork reference number. Believe me there&rsquo;s
some index churning going on. Given that indexing
is pretty fast in a RAM disk, the problem is getting
the indexes there safely.
</p>
<p>
One way round is to copy the files to the RAM disk
before operating the dBASE program, and then
copying them back on close down, you&rsquo;ll away
remember to do it, won&rsquo;t you??!!? But what about
the idiots who usually use the program, they&rsquo;ll
either forget to copy the indexes first in which case
the programs won&rsquo;t work, or worse, they&rsquo;ll forget to
copy them back when they&rsquo;ve finished. Another
way would be to reindex the programs onto the
RAM disk each time the program&rsquo;s started, Ok, and
no need to copy the files back. But even with a RAM
disk, the reindexing process takes some time. I
suppose the whole program could be run under a
