As far as I am concerned, a much more satisfactory
approach is to use a small BASIC program which
examines the text file character by character and
decides whether or not to print and save the
character in a separate, new file, displaying its
progress on the screen. It is slower than using PIP
but the new text scrolls up at a reasonable rate, so
this is not a major drawback.
</p>
<p>
The program asks for the names of the source and
destination files and then reads the data from the
source file, character by character. The file names
must be in upper case letters and if either of them
does not reside on the logged&mdash;in disk, the disk
name must be quoted&nbsp;&ndash; e.g. B:WORKING.DOC. If
a character is found whose ASCII value is greater
than 127, it is converted back to a value less than
127. The program grinds on until it reaches an
End-of-File marker, prints out a message and then
asks if either the source or destination files are to
be deleted.
</p>
<p>
A trial run will show that certain print control
characters are not converted properly &mdash; such as
^B, ^D, ^Q, or ^E. This is because their ASCII
equivalents are less than 127 (control characters
have ASCII codes between 0 and 31). This means
that there will be normal video graphics symbols
corresponding to these codes in the destination file
and on the screen. The overall effect isn&rsquo;t too
serious, however, except where a lot of fancy
printing is involved in the source file.

The interpreted BASIC program implies that
MBASIC.COM must be on one of the drives in the
system, and the conversion process will be rather
slower than would be the case if a compiled BASIC
program was used. With a largish file, the difference
in execution time of the .COM version can be
less than half that of the .BAS, and one has the
added advantage that MBASIC is no longer
required. To give some idea of the time taken, this
article took 54 seconds to &lsquo;tidy&rsquo; using interpreted
BASIC and 26 seconds using the compiled version.
To produce the compiled version, one needs
access to BASCOM.COM, L80.COM and OBSLIB.REL;
the resultant .COM file does not need
BRUN.COM &mdash; which would be the case if BASLIB.REL
were used instead of OBSLIB.
