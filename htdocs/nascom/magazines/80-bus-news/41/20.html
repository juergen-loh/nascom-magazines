CONDITIONAL SUBMIT FILES
By Steve Willmott
</p>
<p>
The CP/M SUBMIT facility is much like an elementary
Job Control Language. The public domain
EXSUB facility is very similar. They both support a
job submission with parameters which enable
repetitive jobs like the development cycle edit,
compile, link and run to be conveniently defined
and then used generally. When submitted only the
command file and the parameters which define this
job (e.g. the source file to be compiled) need be
supplied. A typical example file called MAC.SUB is:
</p>
<p>
ED $1.MAC
</p>
<p>
M80 =$1
</p>
<p>
L80 /P:100,$1,LIBRARY/S,$1/N/E
$1
</p>
<p>
and invoked in response to the CCP prompt to
develop the program DEMO.MAC by
</p>
<p>
SUBMIT MAC DEMO
</p>
<p>
The SUBMIT utility processes the MAC.SUB file
substituting the parameter string &lsquo;DEMO&rsquo; in place
of the piace holder $1. it creates a new file called
$$$.SUB with one command line in each 128 byte
record in the reverse order. Whenever the CCP runs
it looks for this file on disk and reads the last record
into the command area below address 0100 hex,
removes the last record from the file $$$.SUB and
obeys the installed command as if it had been
entered manually. If the CCP finds the file $$$.SUB
empty then it deletes the file from disk thereby
ending the job.
</p>
<p>
However, there is at least one annoying deficiency
in CP/M in this area and that is that the only way to
stop a submit file is to hit the keyboard while the
CCP is reading the next command from disk. CP/M
provides no means of any of the transient programs
run in the TPA to return a success or failure
indication such that the CCP could pick up this
status and automatically abort the submit file. If the
LIBRARY.REL file used above is large it can take
minutes to perform the linkage to produce the
DEMO.COM object file. When the compile fails and
the linker is entered one is tempted to hit the
keyboard very hard, particularly if it is a small
syntax error and a long wait for the linker to
complete. It seems unsatisfying to just hit the
restart button.

<p>
Most decently designed programs output a report
on how well it has run. Perhaps unsurprisingly the
report is left on the screen for the user to see. Each
program normally generates this report in a fairly
fixed format. A compiler will state how many errors
</p>
<p>
or warnings have or have not been found. With a
Gemini IVC or SVC video board (or indeed a
NASCOM with memory mapped display or I
assume an AVC or whatever) one is able to read
back from the display and analyse this report. The
result of the analysis could cause the abortion of
the submit file. This is what the CHECK utility does
when it is run as part of a submit file. The program
has been written for the IVC or SVC, but since the
M80 source for CHECK is listed here it should not
be too difficult to modify for other systems. A
typical use would be in the submit file MAC.SUB:
</p>
<p>
ED $1.MAC.
</p>
<p>
M80 =$
</p>
<p>
CHECK &lsquo;NO FATAL ERROR(S}*/CU
L80 /P:100,$1,LIBRARY/S, $1/N/E
$1
</p>
<p>
The command syntax for CHECK is:
CHECK &lsquo;string&rsquo; /switches
</p>
<p>
The supplied string is compared to a previous fine
on the display according to the optional switches.
If the check is successful CHECK merely exits back
to the CCP and the submit file continues. If the
check fails then CHECK prompts for abortion of the
submission. If the answer is Yes the executing
submit file &lsquo;$$$.SUB&rsquo; is deleted from the disk,
thereby aborting the submit file. If the answer is No
CHECK returns to the CCP and everything carries
on as normal.
</p>
<p>
One can experiment with CHECK by using the
screen edit facilities provided by the BIOS. However,
the following provides some of the rationale
behind the program design. The supplied string
must be in single quotes, because since the
&lsquo;switches are optional one cannot supply a string
of spaces or a null string &ndash; the CCP will not see
them. The &lsquo;/ separator before the switches merely
conforms to common syntax. The switches all have
defaults which allow them to be optional. They can
be supplied in any order. Some of the switches
have been built in to increase the pattern matching
ability of the utility. Considering each switch in
turn:
</p>
<p>
B indicates that previous blank lines are significant
and modifies the effect of the L switch.
The default is to ignore blank lines.
</p>
<p>
Cc indicates that the supplied string must match
the complete displayed line. The example
above means that warnings from the M80
assembler will be trapped as the warning
report follows the fatal error report on the
same line. The default is to allow a match
anywhere in, the line.
</p>
<p>
F indicates that the string must match the finish
of the displayed line. The default is a match
