<u>NEW GEMINI BIOS</u>

<p>
<i>Gemini</i> have now released their new BIOS V3.2
incorprating many advanced features not
normally found in CP/M&nbsp;80 systems. Features
include the ability to add different types of
disk drives including 3.5&Prime; and 8&Prime;; read and
write in twelve different disk formats; CCPZ
allowing 16 separate user areas per drive
with hierarchical search; Max of 5 logical
drives can be set up for floppy based systems
or 8 for Winchester based systems; support
for the
<?php externalLink("GM833"); ?>
ram disk or Gemini page mode
ram disk. For those lucky enough to own
Gemini winchester systems user definable
directory sizes are offered together with
support for two different system tracks.
</p>
<p>
Bios V3.2 is available as an upgrade for
those with an existing Gemini CP/M. We regret
that we are unable to supply this BIOS for
use with Nascom based systems.
