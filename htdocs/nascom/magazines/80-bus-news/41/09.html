think about this one. Why did it only take 30
seconds to copy 200k from Winnie to RAM disk
(and a little bit longer the other way round) and yet
45 minutes to copy 650 odd K from Winnie to disk?

The answer was very simple and easily forgotten,
and goes way way back to the first disk systems for
Nascom and Gemini (remember I had a finger in
that pie all those years back). It&rsquo;s called disk
skewing.
</p>
<p>
All you ever needed to know about disk skew, and
were afraid to ask!!
</p>
<p>
More often than not, customers new to Nascom
and Gemini disk systems using the Gemini CP/M
ask what the format routine means when it asks for
a skew factor. Now I don&rsquo;t know what the Gemini
manuals say about skewing as, in common with
most users, I havent read them. But the point is
easy to grasp once you know what&rsquo;s going on.
</p>
<p>
A virgin disk straight out of the box has nothing
recorded on it so the first thing is to format the disk.
This defines the way in which the data will later be
stored on the disk. Think about what the format
program does when it sets up the disk. The format
program constructs an image of a disk track in RAM
and then writes the image to the disk, a complete
track at a time. The disk contains a number of tracks
starting at track 0 at the outer edge and working
inwards, track 1, track 2, etc., to the innermost track
of the disk, be it track 34, track 39, track 76 or 80,
depending upon the flavour of drive.
</p>
<p>
Now the disk is also split like the slices of a cake,
radial lines from the centre of the disk to the
outside. Where the lines cross the tracks, these
become sectors, so each track is sliced up into a
number of sectors. The data area of each sector will
usually be in multiples of 128 bytes, 128, 256, 512
or 1024. Rarely more than this for reasons to be
revealed. The first sector is indicated by the index
hole in the disk. Note I said the data area of each
sector, as a sector contains more than just the data
bytes. The disk controller needs to be synchronized
with the data on the disk, so the start of each sector
contains some synchronization bytes. Next the
controller likes to know were it&rsquo;s at, so there are a
few bytes saying the track and sector numbers (and
also the &lsquo;sides&rsquo; byte, saying what side of the disk
this is, a real pain that one). This is followed by a
checksum, the header CRC. Then a few more sync
&ndash; bytes and the start of data mark. After all that, then
comes the data, the format program sets these to
Oe5Sh, followed by another checksum, the data CRC.
To polish the sector off there are a few more bytes,
the sector gap, usually some Offh&rsquo;s before the start
of the next sector. The last sector perhaps has a few
more Offh&rsquo;s on the end, to pad the sector up to the
index hole, as you can never be too precise as to
the actual exact number of bytes on a track, as the
whole process is at the mercy of the vagaries of the
speed constancy of the disk drive motor and the
controller clocking speed. Putting too few sectors
on a disk is preferable to too many, as the format
program which sets all this up in the first place
starts and stops writing when it sees the index &ndash;
hole. Too much data and the last sector will be
incomplete causing fatal disk errors. (This error
occurs when formatting disks on a cold day with
the drives running slower than usual.)
</p>
<p>
From all that, you can see the incentive is to make
as few sectors per track as possible. The fewer the
sectors the less space wasted on syne and track
and sector headers, et al, and the more real data
space available. So why rarely more than 1024
bytes in a sector? Well the disk controller is a phase
locked loop device, and when receiving data (as
opposed to sync bytes which it can recognize) the
data transitions should appear in the right places
keeping the loop in lock, but mechanical problems
like sticky disks, cold (or hot) drives, etc., tend to
cause the data transitions to occur out of step. The
phase lock tries, but there must come a time when
it slips a &lsquo;bit&rsquo;. The reliability of the system depends
on the mechanical stability of the drive and media
and the electrical stability of the controller phase
lock. Tolerances in either direction must be allowed
for, so the best way of keeping the whole thing in
step is frequent sync pulses, which from a data
storage point of view are a waste of space. So the
trade-off is the number of sync pulses, hence the
number of sectors, against the ability of the system
to stay synchronized. For good reliabilty, this limits
it to sectors of no more than 1024 data bytes. No
doubt there are those who will argue that their
machine can reliably read a whole track at a time.
I don&rsquo;t doubt it, but what about the next machine?

<p>
So having demolished the way a disk is mapped,
what about this business of &lsquo;skew&rsquo;? Consider!
CP/M is about to load a program. CP/M has a map
of the disk internally (it&rsquo;s stored as part of the
directory information). The map CP/M has is not
the same as the disk map constructed by the format
program. Simply it consists of blocks numbered in
sequence from the end of the system tracks and
directory space, block 0 might be at the start of a
track, or could even be someway through a track.
Blocks may be 1, 2 or 4K in size, and CP/M makes
a calculation considering the sector size of the disk,
and then adding the system track and directory
space offset to determine the appropriate track and
sector. For the sake of example, CP/M has
calculated that the first track/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sector of the program
is 4/1. This information is passed to the disk
controller to fetch track 4 sector 1. The disk head
steps to the correct track, reads data until it
recognizes the sync bytes, and reads the next
sector header it sees. This header will tell it it&rsquo;s on
the right track (or not), and as this happened at
some random time, like as not, the sector number
will be wrong. The disk, of course, continues to
