the relevant part highlighted in inverse video. Little
concession is made to the cleverness of the <i>Gemini</i>
screen addressing, as the program is intended for
use with CP/M machines in general. To this end the
screen is treated in the simplest fashion consistent
with tidiness and readability.

I&rsquo;m slowly working through all the 80-BUS stuff I&rsquo;ve
got on disk, so next time, instead of my saying &lsquo;I
think it was written up somewhere&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be able to
say exactly what, when and where! That&rsquo;s some
1.8M bytes on three disks covering about 100 files.
Mind you, it&rsquo;ll take some time, as I have to decide
the search criteria and introduce the search keys as
required. A further problem is that I don&rsquo;t have all
of the past 80-BUSes, only the parts I&rsquo;ve written or
edited, Paul has the rest, if he hasn&rsquo;t reformatted
and re-used the disks.

<p>
The problem is what to make Gateway look for! As,
for instance, in the case of letters files, Gateway
doesn&rsquo;t know that CEGB and electricity are related
until you do a cross search for either or both. This
problem is eased a little within Gateway by an
option which says &lsquo;ignore&rsquo; case, so &lsquo;Central
Electricity Generating Board&rsquo; and the word &lsquo;ELECTRICITY&rsquo;
could be tied up without further intervention.
But you still have to know what way you
want the data presented and how to find it in the
first place. In some ways Gateway could be likened
to the early days of the laser, a solution looking for
a problem. It needs imagination to figure out what
you want Gateway to do, once you&rsquo;ve decided,
Gateway can do it.

<h4>
The Pathway
</h4>
<p>
The companion program to Gateway, Pathway, is
something else. Parts of it have immediate uses.
Now most of you will be aware that not all text
processors write straight ASCII text to a file.
WORDSTAR for instance riddles the text with &lsquo;bit 7&rsquo;
set and uses only line feeds instead of CR/LF&rsquo;s
within paragraphs. If you use the CP/M &lsquo;TYPE&rsquo;
command (without CCPZ) on a piece of WORDSTAR
text, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. Other text
processors leave text controls lying about to a
greater or lesser extent.
</p>
<p>
Gateway will handle text from any source, but
merging different bits of text from different
processors leaves a problem for the text processor
ultimately used to edit the result. Ideally Gateway
would like standard ASCII text, or at least, all the
same type of text, but conversion from one source
to another is a bit of a pain. CONVERT, part of
Pathway does just that. It has three tables, the input
conversion table, the output conversion table and
a video conversion table. Each table consists of 256
comparison strings. The data is read from an input
file and all incoming characters are compared with
the input table and are either left unchanged,
converted to another character or converted to an
n-length string. The idea is to convert all input to a
given standard, say ASCII. Likewise, on the way out
to the output file, all characters are compared with
the output table and similar conversions can take
place. A third table may be used for the output to
convert video control strings which might be used
for special functions on some video terminals or
printers.
</p>
<p>
The main purpose of Pathway is to format and print
text without the intervention of a text processor.
The text would {normally} come from Gateway
output files, but any text may be used. The input
and output conversion tables used by CONVERT
can be invoked, so special print controls may be
inserted as required. Pathway also accepts an
extensive set of &lsquo;dot&rsquo; commands within the text,
akin to WORDSTAR, for such things as line length,
page length, headings, footings, margins and
many more. Unfortunately these commands are
not exactly compatible with those used by WORDSTAR.
The net result is neatly formatted text, to suit
the printer in use from any old source file
regardless of the original format.
</p>
<p>
Gateway and Pathway are all clever stuff, and
represent a different and very efficient way of
dealing with large amounts of text identification
and retrieval. I suppose it would really come into its
own for use with disk versions of the Encyclopaedia
Brittanica or for cataloguing libraries or some such.
Using it to cross index my letters files and on my
bits of 80-BUS text seems a trivial occupation for a
program of the obvious power of Gateway. I feel a
little intimidated by the concept of the program.
Perhaps I feel inadequate because I can&rsquo;t think of a
really good job for it to get to grips with. I like it, I
use it (it&rsquo;s not difficult), I just find it difficult to
enthuse over it.
