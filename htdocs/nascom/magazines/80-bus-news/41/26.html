PRESTEL UPDATE
by Robin Luxford
</p>
<p>
A review of the Henelec Prestel Terminal program
and some installation notes on the GEC LTU-II kit.
</p>
<p>
Although the 300 BAUD Preste/ service has been
accessible to CP/M 80-BUS computers for some
time (see 80-BUS NEWS Vol 2. iss 6.), the
appearance of the new Henelec PRETZEL 2 software
from Henry&rsquo;s has made the 75/1200 BAUD
service readily available. Since the 300 BAUD ports
on the Prestel computers strip all the graphics
characters and replace them with asterisks, the
graphics are pretty dull. The full set of characters
and mosaics loaded into the Gemini SVC/IVC video
boards by PRETZEL 2 makes the display of pages
far more interesting and represent a fair compromise
as the SVC/IVC can not reproduce colour.
PRETZEL 2 also reprograms the SVC/VC to the
Prestel screen format of 40 columns by 24 lines,
making text and graphics appear in the correct
aspect ratio, a considerable improvement over the
normally cramped output of the 300 BAUD service
displayed using a normal terminal program.
</p>
<p>
PRETZEL 2 has facilities for saving and reloading
pages to and from disk (either on or off line), and
also for dumping the current screen image to
printer. The program contains a screen editor
allowing the user to alter and experiment with
pages without being connected to the Prestel
computer. On line the system works in the
approved Preste/ full duplex mode where all
keyboard input except the program&rsquo;s command
codes is echoed to the screen via the Prestel
computer. Off line all keyboard entry is direct.
</p>
<p>
My only criticisms of the software are the lack of a
directory facility, coupled with the fact that the
program stores the screen images individually
rather than in the form of a random access file. The
latter is wasteful of disk space as each image is
only 1K long but with a Gemini CP/M block size of
4K, three quarters of the space allocated is wasted.
The former is simply inconvenient as the number
of saved pages soon mounts up, and it is difficult
to remember what names have been used or may
be deleted.
</p>
<p>
The program is written entirely in Z80 machine
code and is supplied on disk as a fully commented
Z80 source file suitable for the Microsoft M80
assembler. All documentation is supplied on the
disk along with some twenty demonstration pages.
The user has to patch the I/O section to accommodate
the modem used and select the various
options for Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini processor cards and
either SVC or IVC and then assemble the program
for use. One assembly option is to include the
users&rsquo; identity number and password which are
</p>
<p>
then sent automatically on log-on. Minor text
changes would make the source file suitable for
most other Z80 assemblers. Another advantage of
having the source file is that it is possible to patch
in any auto-dial facilities which the user may
require such as those described on page 22 of
80-BUS NEWS vol 2. iss 6.
</p>
<p>
Overall I have found PRETZEL 2 an excellent piece
of software particularly at the &pound;30.00 charged for it.
The well chosen graphics more than make up for
lack of colour on the screen and&rsquo;its storage and
printer facilities offer much more comprehensive
use of Prestel than an adaptor connected to a TV
set.
</p>
<p>
My modem is the 75/1200 BAUD modem available
as a surplus unit from the same source as the
program. The GEC LTU-11 modem was designed
for a GEC Preste/ terminal, but slight hardware
modifications make it entirely suitable for use with
either Nascom or Gemini processors. The unit is
supplied in two parts, as a printed card about 6 x 4
inches, without circuit diagrams but with full
descriptive manual, and a sealed box contdining
the auto-dial relays and isolation transformer,
measuring some 3 x 5 x 2 inches (oddly enough the
isolation box is supplied with circuit diagrams but
no description). The modest power supplies are
derived from the computer. The modem card
expects TTL level inputs and outputs so a simple
interface is required to make it suitable for the
RS232 from either a Gemini or Nascom. Additionally
the data to and from the card is inverted so use
is made of a simple 74LS04 to buffer the data, and
provide the inversions.
</p>
<p>
Data out from the RS232 is clipped using two
resistors and zener diode to convert the + and-12V
RS232 swing to a swing between 0 and 5 volts, this
is then inverted by one of the inverters in the
74LS04. Data output from the modem is inverted
by another inverter in the 74LS04 and fed directly
to the RS232 input. Although this input is not at
RS232 levels, both the Gemini and Nascom input
circuitry cope quite adequately. Dialing information
is taken from a port and fed directly to the
dialing/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>isolation box which requires TTL level
inputs. A word of warning about the dialing/
isolation box. All inputs including the power supply
are protected by what appear to be fusible zener
diodes, which go short circuit if a voltage across
any line exceeds 6V. These devices, which are
probably included to protect the computer from
lightning strikes on the telephone line are, i) very
fast, and, ii) very unforgiving. So care is required to
ensure correct working voltages on the dialing/
isolation box.
</p>
<p>
The whole system works extremely well and
complements the PRETZEL 2 software nicely. As
the whole lot, modem and software cost less than
&pound;60.00 and provided a couple of evenings entertainment
sorting it all out, I consider it money well
spent.
