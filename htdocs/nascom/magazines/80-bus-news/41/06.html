I would like to echo David Plews&rsquo; comments in
praise of the CPMUGUK (Vol&nbsp;3, Issue&nbsp;4 of 80-BUS
News). I joined some months ago and soon found
their journal essential reading (as is 80-BUS News
of course!). The quantity of virtually free software
is incredible. I haven&rsquo;t even read all the index yet!
The service from the &lsquo;Librarian&rsquo; (Derek Fordred) is
excellent; I normally receive disks within 9 days of
posting off my request.

<p>
I have just received a graphics suite called PLOT 33
on SIG/M Volume 194. This suite allows the
production of pictures, graphs, bar charts, etc, on
my Epson MX80 type II. It can be driven from
MBASIC, TURBO <span class="uppercase">Pascal</span> and <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>. It is
extremely well documented&nbsp;&ndash; approximately 25
pages. It is easily configured to any of the popular
dot matrix printers with addressable dot graphics.
When I get the hang of it a bit better, I&rsquo;ll try and
write a review for 80-BUS News.

On another subject, the
<a href="../../../34/30/text/#article3">free ad.</a>
I placed in Vol 3, Iss
4 worked&nbsp;&ndash; I sold my PCG within a week of
publication. Dr Plews may do better from
<a href="../../../34/23/text/#article2">his ad</a>. in
the same issue if it has contained his correct phone
number! Ed.&nbsp;&ndash; Dr Plews has sent us his correct number,
it is (they are!) Day ____ _____, Evening ____ _____. I
have so far failed to contact him. By the way, I may
be able to help him in dumping
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
pictures to his
printer&nbsp;&ndash; I have unravelled GDUMP from Lucas
Logic and modified it to operate as a subroutine to
be called from Basic, etc,. I have also relocated it.
</p>
<?php nowrapEnd(); ?>
<p>
In addition, I have written routines to dump the
AVC image to my Epson the right way up and
smaller than the sideways picture produced by
GDUMP. Any of these should be easily adapted to
drive David&rsquo;s <i>Gemini</i> 10X.
</p>
<p>
Now a quick plug &mdash; these &ldquo;dump&rdquo; programs and
many others are currently circulating on the
NASDOS USERS GROUP DISK<i>S</i> (yes, two!).
</p>
<p>
Yours truly, Colin Case, Rugby.
