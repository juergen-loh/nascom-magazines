hand if need be. The program fulfilled its main
purpose, and the backup disks are made using the
separate BACKUP program which had been used
previously.

<h4>
<i>Nascom</i> &mdash; Where now?
</h4>
<p>
Fairly regularly people walk in the shop and say,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an old <i>Nascom</i>&nbsp;2 and don&rsquo;t know whether
to get rid of it or spend some loot and upgrade it.&rdquo;.
Well two things are apparent, firstly there are a lot
of <i>Nascom</i>&nbsp;2&rsquo;s still around (there should be, as
nearly 10,000 were made before Lucas got there
paws on the show), and secondly a lot of people
are still dedicated to the machine which in all
probability they sweated blood over building some
three or four years back.
</p>
<p>
The problem is doing anything with a <i>Nascom</i>
works out expensive. Possibly the cheapest way
out is to flog the <i>Nascom</i> to some unsuspecting
mug and then go and buy a <i>Beeb</i>, a Spectrum, a
Commodore or some other such Mickey Mouse
computer. But then none of these has the potential
of an expanded <i>Nascom</i>, despite the plethora of
add-on bits you can get for them.
</p>
<p>
All the following comments apply equally to the
<i>Nascom</i>&nbsp;1, but remember that for optimum results
the N1 should be capable of running at 4MHz
(although the disk systems will run as slow as
2MHz with no wait states) and the N1 should have
a decent buffer board. The original <i>Nascom</i> buffer
board wasn&rsquo;t too clever! The <i>Gemini</i>
<?php externalLink("GM806","GM806AK"); ?>
combined backplane-cum-buffer board is fine.
(This IS still available, so don&rsquo;t believe any dealer
who says he can&rsquo;t get it for you anymore.)
</p>
<p>
The only viable upgrade of a <i>Nascom</i> is towards
disks, a goodly few have already taken that course,
and I think those who have gone that way are
happy. Expensive certainly, but still worth the
money as the end result still costs less than going
out and buying an equivalent machine from new.
However, even this route is becoming more
circumscribed as Lucas seem to contract their
<i>Nascom</i> operation and <i>Gemini</i> have reduced the
number of options available. MAP are still around
and in there somewhere, but I haven&rsquo;t heard from
them for some time.
</p>
<p>
All permutations would need at least 48K of RAM
and all would require disk drives. The drives would
be either single or double sided 80 track drives. The
drive boxes available from the various 80-BUS
manufacturers are all comparitively expensive, and
cheaper equivalents can be found advertised as
options for the Beeb computer. But watch the
specs. Check that what you are buying does or
does not include power supplies (as required) and
that 40/80 track types are really 80 track types and
not some &lsquo;cod&rsquo; used by the various DOSes for the
Beeb.
</p>
<p>
The basic choices left are:
</p>
<ol class="paranthesis">
<li><i>Nascom</i> NASDOS with the <i>Nascom</i>
controller card, with or without the
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?> card.</li>
<li><i>Nascom</i> CP/M with the <i>Nascom</i> disk
controller and AVC cards.</li>
<li><i>Gemini</i> CP/M with the <i>Gemini</i> disk
controller and
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
or
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
cards.</li>
<li>MAP CP/M with the MAP VFC disk
controller/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>video card.</li>
<li>Careful permutations of 3 and 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Choice 1) Uses the original <i>Nascom</i> screen display
and needs the <i>Nascom</i> disk controller card. It may
well not be the best choice, for although NASDOS
allows the use of your original <i>Nascom</i> software,
little if any new software has been made available.
</p>
<p>
Choice 2) Uses the original <i>Nascom</i> screen display
and needs the <i>Nascom</i> disk controller card. Not a
bad choice, CP/M&nbsp;2.2 seems to be the route to take.
The <i>Nascom</i> CP/M uses the <i>Nascom</i> AVC as either
a colour display or as an 80 column display (very
necessary for CP/M). The <i>Nascom</i> AVC is a bit slow
in the 80 column mode.
</p>
<p>
The problem with either choices 1) or 2) is likely to
be support. Most of <i>Nascoms</i>&rsquo; old faithful dealers
now no longer stock <i>Nascom</i> products and Lucas
do not seem to be encouraging new dealers. The
only dealer (as far as I am aware) able to offer full
support for <i>Nascom</i> products these days is B &amp; L
Micros at Kenilworth. So unless you live in the
Midlands, the <i>Nascom</i> options might not be
advisable.
</p>
<p>
Choice 3) Uses the <i>Gemini</i>
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
disk controller
card or the (now obsolete)
<?php externalLink("GM809"); ?>
card. Possibly
the most universal choice. There were more
<i>Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini</i> hybrids in the recent 80BUS
survey than anything else except straight <i>Gemini</i>
systems. <i>Gemini</i> have recently reduced the permutations
of CP/M&nbsp;2.2 for <i>Nascom</i>, so the only
version currently available uses single or double
sided 80 track drives and must use either the
<i>Gemini</i> SVC or the (now obsolete)
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
card. This
makes it the most expensive choice, but it wins on
both overall operating speed and disk capacity.
You could save money by using secondhand
<?php externalLink("GM809"); ?>
and
<?php externalLink("GM812"); ?>
cards as these still seem to be
around in small quantities from people who have
upgraded to GM829 and
<?php externalLink("GM832"); ?>
respectively.
</p>
<p>
Choice 4) Uses the MAP VFC combined video and
disk controller card. Available with either CP/M&nbsp;2.2
or CP/M&nbsp;3. (None of the other manufacturers have
opted for CP/M&nbsp;3 as there is little to show for the
increased cost.) About the same price as the
straight <i>Gemini</i> choice using secondhand cards.
</p>
<p>
Choice 5) Careful permutations of <i>Gemini</i> and MAP
cards with a suitable choice of CP/M (<i>Gemini</i> or
MAP, depending upon the exact permutation) will
work but there seems no advantage in opting fora
