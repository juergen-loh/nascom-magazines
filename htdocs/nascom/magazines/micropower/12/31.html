<span class="uppercase">Intelligent Copy</span> Ixxxx yyyy zzzz
</h3>
<p>
This command is used to copy a block od data zzzz bytes long from xxxx to
yyyy. The routine first subtracts yyyy from xxxx; if xxxx is greater the normal copy
command is used, as data cannot be overwritten. If yyyy is greater, the pointers to
the two data blocks (data written from, data written to) are reset to the top ends by
adding the length of the blocks less one, and the data is then copied from the top
down; this ensures that data is not overwritten.

Basic Cold Start J
</h3>
<p>
Command J causes a jump to &pound;FFFA, which is the &lsquo;cold start&rsquo; address for the
ROM version of Nascoms Microsoft Basic. The cold start initialises the Basic
workspace; as part of this process it uses a small section of memory in the Basic
Interpreters text area, with the result that a cold start not only &lsquo;kills&rsquo; any program
already entered, but also corrupts two or three lines near the start of such a program,
which makes recovery of a program after a cold start a much more fiddly process.

<h3>
KEYBOARD Kxx
</h3>
<p>
When this command is executed the low byte of the first hex value on the input
line, which is held in the L register, is stored at a location called $KOPT (&pound;0C27).
When a character is input from the keyboard it is first converted to ASCII, and the
value at &pound;0C27 is then tested. If this value is zero, as after a RESET, the keyboard
character remains unchanged. If bit 0 of (&pound;0C27) is set and the character is a letter,
bit 6 of the character is inverted. This reverses the effect of the shift key for letters,
i.e., it changes upper case to lower case, and vice versa; the keyboard now operates
in the typewriter mode. If bit 2 of (&pound;0C27) is set, bit 7 of the character is inverted; this
reverses the effect of the graphics key. The value stored at &pound;0C27 is retained until
changed by a subsequent K command, or returned to zero by RESET.

I hope to conclude the the discussion of the commands, and
give a listing of an improved Read routine, which does not load data if the checksum
is incorrect
