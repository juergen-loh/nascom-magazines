example above for completeness. When writing programs FOR&nbsp;. . NEXT loops be
sure not to change the value of the loop variable within the loop, or you may find the
program gets &lsquo;hung up&rsquo; in the loop. When the program exits from a loop the loop
variable is one STEP greater then the value set by the TO limit. Try entering:
</p>
<pre style="text-align: center">
FOR A = 1 to 50:NEXT:PRINT A
</pre>
<p class="continued">
when you will receive the answer 51.
</p>
<p>
Right, we can now analyse the operation of the title printing program. Line 10
clears the screen, defines Z$ as PROGRAM TITLE, and sets up a loop to scan this
string letter by letter. Line 30 is merely the NEXT part of this loop. However, line 20
looks quite complex, and certainly refutes claims that Basic programs bear any
relationship to simple English.
</p>
<p>
In fact the line consists of a single command of the form POKE X,Y, but here
both X and Y are complex expressions. The memory location into which data is being
inserted is 3017 + I + (48 &ndash; LEN(Z$))/2. Now 3017 is one less than the decimal
address of the start of the top line on the Nascom screen, so as I is increased from 1
in the loop 3017 + 1 steps through the memory locations at the start of this line. To
this value an offset (48 &ndash; LEN(Z$))/2 is added. This merely deducts the string length
from the line length and halves the result, to ensure that the title is centred. If the
number of characters in the string is odd the offset will not be an integer, but the
POKE command used only the integral part of the expression, try entering POKE
2531.7,7.3. Thus as the program cycles round the loop, data is inserted into the
central LEN(Z$) locations of the top line. The value inserted at the Ith point is
ASC(MID$(Z$,I,1)), that is, the ASCII code corresponding to the Ith character in the
string.
</p>
<p>
So one by one the letters of the title appear at the top of the screen. Easy, isn&rsquo;t
it? Well, perhaps it is too easy that I can be accused of making a simple subject
complicated, but the point of analysing this short program in such detail is that what
you learn can be carried over to help you write your next program.
</p>
<p>
Finally, here is a simple program to print out the complete ASCII and graphics
set, with a space between each character:
</p>
<pre style="text-align: center">
10 CLS:FOR A = 1 TO 255:PRINT CHR$(A);:NEXT
</pre>
<p>
In the next article I shall cover further Basic commands, including the double
PEEK and POKE commands DEEK and DOKE, and examine the syntax and use of
the PRINT command.
