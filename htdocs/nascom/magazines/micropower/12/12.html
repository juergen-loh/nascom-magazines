<h3>
THE SCENARIO
</h3>
<p>
You have just added a disc drive or two and CP/M to your Nascom&nbsp;2. After a
few minutes gloating, you try the Digital Research editor, ED.COM) and find that it
is a pig to use. Then you discover that the assembler provided only knows 8080
codes, instead of speaking Z80; even worse, it uses weird mnemonics designed
to confuse anyone who is used to the Zilog set.
</p>
<h3>
THE ANSWER
</h3>
<p>
You could buy Diskpen and Macro-80 to solve your problem &ndash; if you have
enough money left after lashing out on the discs. If you did, you still won&rsquo;t be able to
run all your old programs. In this article I provide instructions that will enable you
to produce a CP/M program that will pretend to be Nas-Sys&nbsp;1. I also provide some
machine code which enables the new version of Nas-Sys to read from and write to
the disc.
</p>
<p>
To avoid possible problems with copyright, not to mention space in the magazine,
the Nas-Sys code is not given. If you got your Nascom by legal means, you will
find it in your manual.
</p>
<h3>
THE METHOD
</h3>
<ol class="paranthesis indent">
<li>
Initialise a disc, and copy DDT.COM onto it. This dynamic debugger is the
closest CP/M comes to a monitor program like Nas-Sys; it can do some
clever tricks, but is not exactly &ldquo;user friendly".
</li>
<li>
Type DDT followed by Enter. This, of course, runs DDT.COM. In future I
will put Enter so-and-so for anything that you have to type with Enter
after it.
</li>
<li>
Clear some memory to work in, otherwise things can get very untidy, and
you won&rsquo;t be sure if you typed the code you find when you come back
from a tea break.<br>
Enter F100, B00 ,0.
</li>
<li>
Type in the section of Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 from 0108H to 07FFH in it&rsquo;s proper
addresses in memory. Enter S108 to do this. Notice that it isn&rsquo;t as
easy to type in hexadecimal code with this system as it is with Nas-Sys.
Also notice that, where the listing should show all of the strings
following EF, it only shows the first byte. Fortunately, the machine code
in the listing does show what should be there.
</li>
<li>
Type in the start of Nas-Sys&nbsp;1, normally found between 0000H and
0107H, at addresses 0800H to 0907H, using the S command instead of
DDT again.
</li>
</ol>
