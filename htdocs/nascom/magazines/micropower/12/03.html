Dear Sir,

<p>
Could readers recommend a cassette recorder which will reliable record
and play back at 2400 baud and which is available from a retail outlet in this
country.

* I have used a Hitachi TRQ 295R for computer tapes since I got my Nascom, and it
is very reliable at 2400 baud (it &lsquo;almost&rsquo; worked at 4800 baud). It would be
interesting to hear from readers on this one, so that we could get a consensus on the
&lsquo;most reliable&rsquo; recorder.

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I was very interested in the &lsquo;Snowdinger&rsquo; article in issue 1 of the
magazine. I have a Nascom&nbsp;2, and although screen disturbance is a minor problem
it is nevertheless present. In fact. it seems to become more pronounced after the
machine has been on for an hour or two. I&rsquo;d be very glad to see a article for the
Nascom&nbsp;2.
</p>
<p>
Another hardware request: is there any simple way to recover the bottom two
lines of the Nascom&nbsp;2 graphics characters,

* Yes indeed there is. A modification, involving bending a few IC pins and adding
half a dozen wire links, has been published in the Liverpool Software Gazette.
It not only recovers the bottom lines, but also improves screen stability. Are enough
people interested for us to get the original authors to write a short article for
Micropower?

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I would like to see published in the magazine information (or where to
get it) on the keyboard supplied with the Nascom&nbsp;2. As you know, there is no
diagram or info in the kit, and I feel this could be of use to many N2 owners,

* The first article in this issue contains a circuit diagram of an &lsquo;upgraded&rsquo; Nascom&nbsp;1
keyboard, which is identical with the Nascom&nbsp;2 keyboard.
