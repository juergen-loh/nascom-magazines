I have just received the latest copy of Mid-Sussex Micro Club News. It&rsquo;s a club
for all micros, but Nascom gets more than it&rsquo;s fair share of attention in the newsletter.
As they have offered use the use of any of their material I hope to give you a sample
of their output in the near future.

Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
May I wish you all success with the new magazine. Most of the currently
available crop of mags. Seem to have disappeared under a morass of waffle about
the socio/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>politico/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>business implications of micros. Hard factual articles and good
software tipsare virtually non-existent.
</p>
<p>
Anyone wishing to contact a group of Nascom&nbsp;1 and 2 owning enthusiasts in the
Lincoln are can contact me at the address below (or by phone). We have 8 machines
between us, including a disc based N1 and an Epsom equipped N2. We have both
&ldquo;meddlers&rdquo; (harware) and &ldquo;thinkers&rdquo; (software), with a reasonable degree of
expertise. We usually meet on Wednesday evenings, but weekend sessions are not
unheard of. We are always glad to meet new enthusiasts, even when they are just
passing through the area.
</p>
<p>
Suggestions for the magazine? What about a cheap Modem design &ndash; the we
can have a national NASCOM-NET! Similarly a graphics tablet (with hi-res graphics)
&ndash; has anyone designed one yet?
