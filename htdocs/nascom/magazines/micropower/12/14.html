will appear. Then proceed as if using ordinary Nas-Sys, with the following commands
added:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
Enter D to return control to CP/M (or press RESET).
</p>
<p>
Enter Pxxxx yyyy to Put a section of memory onto the disc, where xxxx is
the start of the block and yyyy is the end of it.
</p>
<p>
Enter Fxxxx to Fetch a section of memory from disc, where xxxx is the
start of the memory into which you want the data to be put.

<h3>
THE LIMITATIONS
</h3>
<p>
Because of the changes made to the monitor, programs that decide which
monitor they are being run with by reading the first byte of the monitor will need to be
modified. This includes ZEAP you will find.
</p>
<p>
When you are asked for a file name and type by the P and F commands, there
is no check whether your input is sensible. File names in lower case in the directory
are very difficult to get rid of, a fact you may or may not find useful.
</p>
<p>
Programs that write direct to the VDU RAM, or read from it, will need to be
modified to take account of the change in the address of this RAM in CP/M systems.
This does not apply to programs making use of the monitor&rsquo;s screen handling
routines, of course.

<h3>
THE COMMERCIALS
</h3>
<p>
If you don&rsquo;t fancy all the typing that this project will need, send me a properly
initialised disc (sysgen, etc.) and a pound for post, packing and not a lot of profit, and
I&rsquo;ll save you the effort. The address is:
