EDITORIAL
</h1>
<p>
We have received quite a lot of feedback from the first <a href="../text/"></a>issue by now, and most of
the comments have been favourable. In fact I am left with a sneaking suspicion that
all the people who liked the magazine have been kind enough to write and say so,
while those who thought it not worth reading haven&rsquo;t bothered to communicate their
opinions.
</p>
<p>
It is very pleasing to know that a particular article has been of interest &ndash; we
can use the letters to persuade the author to write for us again &ndash; but we would also
like to know what displeased you. If you can be abusive wittily we shall publish
your letter.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the best letters, complimentary or uncomplimentary, are those that
end " . . I am enclosing an article for publication.&rdquo;. We can never get too many of
this type of letter, so keep sending them in.
</p>
<p>
We shall be producing two more issues this year, in November and December,
and we have some very interesting articles planned. For example, we have the
design for an interface which reads TRS&nbsp;80 tapes, together with the software to
control the interface and then convert TRS&nbsp;80 Basic programs to run under Nascom
Basic; a design for a 2708/2716 programmer; a machine code Lisp interpreter; a
program to interconvert Crystal Basic and Microsoft programs; and the usual
selection of hardware and software tips.
