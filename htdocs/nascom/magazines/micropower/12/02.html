Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Congratulations on the
<a href="../../../11/01/text/#page">first issue</a>,
although it was possibly a bit &lsquo;heavy&rsquo;.
Your printer is obviously capable of correspondence quality print in condensed
mode, but the cumulative effect of continuous bold print is to make the text harder to
read. I know that they are expensive, but it would look much nicer with a daisywheel
printer, surely you can scrounge one somewhere.
</p>
<p>
The one real criticism that I would make is that after devoting a substantial
portion of the magazine to PCG design, the circuit diagram was unintelligible to a
non-technical reader. The principle seemed simple enough and was well
explained, but I think that a full circuit diagram would have been better or &ndash; dare I
suggest &ndash; a Vero layout. It would have taken space, and possibly contributorbadgering,
but you are liable to brickbats from readers who misunderstood the
project as described.
</p>
<p>
I am currently writing an article on a very simple project which I will send
along to you. We mustn&rsquo;t forget that a growing number of Nascom owners have
bought their machines built and are not part of the merry band of track-hackers that
some of these modifications are aimed at.

* We had to publish this letter because it&rsquo;s the most critical one we received. As we
pointed out in the article on the PCG, the construction involves a lot of tedious hardwiring
of the address and data lines, and if you don&rsquo;t fully understand what is
neessary then it is best not to start. I agree entirely about the printing, so if any
reader has a spare daisy wheel printer&nbsp;. . .

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Here is a query for your reader. Does anyone know of a simple circuit to
give the equivalent of a typewriter shift lock key for the Nascom&nbsp;2?

* The keyboard is software controlled, so the addition of any shift lock circuit will
mean changing the monitor EPROM software. There is a spare input line to port 0
(bit 7), and if this was connected to a switch so that it could be at +&nbsp;5&nbsp;volts or
0&nbsp;volts, the state of this line could be used to invert the action of the shift key by a
slight modification to the monitor. Have our readers any other ideas?

Dear Sir,

I at present own a Nascom&nbsp;1, to which I am in the process of building on
more memory. I intend to install a Gemini EPROM
<?php externalLink("GM803","G803"); ?>
card which will carry
Enertech 16K f.p. Pascal or <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?>
Naspas (12K). Have there been any article
comparing these compilers? Are they based on the Jensen-Wirth or
<?php externalLink("UCSD Pascal","",""); ?>?
Does the Enertech compiler generate P-code? Has any Nascom user done what I
