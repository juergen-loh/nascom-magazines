<h3>
LOAD L
</h3>
<p>
ln Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 this command is used to load data from a paper tape reader.
The data must have been stored on the tape in the format used by the standard
Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 tabulate commands i.e., the address of the first data byte, eight data
bytes, checksum, all represented in hexadecimal and separated by spaces; the
line is terminated by a carriage return. As the tape is read the data is displayed on
the screen; when the end of the line is reached (detected by the carriage return)
the data is read into the workspace by the same routine which reads the arguments
supplied with commands. Thus the loading address is read into ARG1 (&pound;0C0C,
&pound;0C0D), the eight data bytes into ARG2 &ndash; ARG9 (&pound;0C0E to &pound;0C1D), and the
checksum into ARG10 (&pound;0C1E, &pound;0C1F). The routine then totals the values stored
in ARG1 &ndash; ARG9 and compares the result with the checksum. If the values are
identical the eight data bytes are copied from the workspace to the appropriate
memory location, the cursor is reset to the beginning of the line, and the next block
is read in, overwriting the last line. if a checksum error is detected, or if invalid
characters are detected by the routine which reads the data into the workspace, the
faulty line is scrolled up the screen and the routine proceeds to the next block.
</p>
<p>
Data can be written to a paper tape punch in the correct format by routing the
output of the Tabulate command to the serial port by means of the External (X)
command. However, in Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 the Load command has been dropped; the
address stored in the subroutine table for command L (at &pound;0798) is &pound;0366, the Error
subroutine. Because the Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 tabulate command is not restricted to the &ndash;
format of a Load command it has been made more versatile in the line lengths it can
produce, and also no longer gives a checksum byte.

<h3>
MODIFY Mxxxx
</h3>
<p>
This permits direct insertion of data into memory from the keyboard. When the
command is entered the address xxxx is displayed, followed by the byte currently
at that address, the cursor is moved left three spaces after the routine which
displays the data byte; since this routine outputs the two digits which represent
this byte in hexadecimal followed by a space, this places the cursor on the first
character of the byte. Data can now be typed in hexadecimal format, successive
bytes being separated by one or more spaces. When the newline key is pressed the
monitor interprets the current line; the first number on the line is taken as the
address at which data storage is to start. If the first group of characters on the line
is not a valid hexadecimal number, that is, does not consist only of the ASCII
characters 0 &ndash; 9 and A &ndash; F representing a hexadecimal number between 0 and
FFFF the word &lsquo;Error&rsquo; is printed, and the routine restarts at the last valid address.
