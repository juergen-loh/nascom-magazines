Reading TRS-80 Program Tapes
</h1>

There is a great deal of software available for micro-computers, but it is
generally not possible to exchange programs between systems because the data
is stored on tape in different formats. This article describes a method for
reading and converting <?php externalLink("TRS-80"); ?>
tapes for the Nascom. The project needs both
hardware and software, and is for TRS-80 Level 2 Basic (also Video Genie in the
U.K., P.M.C-80 in U.S.A, and System 80 in Australia and N.Z.), but it could be
modified for other machines.
</p>
<p>
The TRS-80 writes tapes at 500&nbsp;Baud. An 80 microsecond clock pulse is sent
to the tape every 2 milliseconds. The data bits to be stored are represented by
inserting an extra 80 microsecond pulse between two clock pulses for a 1, and
leaving the gap empty for a 0. This of course is incompatible with the CUTS
standard used in the Nascom II. Therefore a small circuit consisting of one LM3900
(an IC containing four operational amplifiers) and a couple of dozen discrete
components is used to input the signal from the cassette via the Nascom
<?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>. Figure 1 shows the circuit diagram of the interface, while a suggested
Vero layout is shown in figure 2. Make sure that pin 11 of the Nascom&nbsp;2 PIO plug
is connected to 0&nbsp;volts on pin 16.

The first part of the program reads the tape and loads it into the correct memory
location for Nascom&nbsp;2 Basic. As the reading is done by software timing, the
delay values in the program will vary for machines running at 2&nbsp;Mhz and 4Mhz. At
the start of the tape there is about 4 seconds of nulls (00), followed by a sync
character of A5 hex. When this character is detected the program starts to load the
data from the tape starting at address &pound;10F6; as it is stored, the data is also
displayed on line one of the screen. The first four characters are SSSn, where n is
the program identification. These are not used, and the actual Basic program starts
at &pound;10FA. The end of the program is indicated by three nulls, which cause a jump to
part two of the tape reading routine.
