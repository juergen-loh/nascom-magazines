PRINT
</h3>
<p>
Since most of us cut our programming teeth on the PRINT statement, there is
not much point in covering acres of paper in explanations and illustrations &ndash; however
for the benefit of those just beginning I will summarise the ground rules. [INPUT
&ldquo;Enter SKILL LEVEL&rdquo;; X$:IF X$= &ldquo;ADVANCED&rdquo; THEN GOTO(next section)]
</p>
<p>
The PRINT statement outputs to a terminal, usually the screen or a printer(or
both). It operates from the current position of the cursor. If used on its own, a
carriage return/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>line feed(CR/LF) is output, thus placing the cursor at the start of the
next line.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
You can also print numbers [PRINT 5] , the answers to calculations [PRINT 5*6
(=30)], the value of variables [PRINT A (=10 where A=10)], string literals [PRINT
&ldquo;Fred&rdquo;], strings [PRINT X$ (Nascom-where X$ has been defined as &ldquo;Nascom&rdquo;), plus
a whole series of intrinsic functions which are listed in the manual. Useful examples
are:-
</p>
<p class="noindent">
PRINT CHR$(X) &ndash; where X has any ASCII value from 0 to 255. For example,
CHR$(65) prints the letter A, CHR$(181) prints a small human figure, if your system
is equipped with the Nascom&nbsp;2 graphics ROM.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
PRINT FRE(0) &ndash; gives you the remaining memory space available for your BASIC
program.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
PRINT SQR(X) &ndash; outputs the square-root of X.
</p>
<p>
In formatting text it is obviously important to know where the cursor will be
positioned after the computer has carried out a PRINT instruction. If a PRINT
statement is terminated with a colon, or if the line ends without a special terminator,
the next PRINT statement will begin at the start of the next line, the Nascom having
output a CR/LF. However, if you end the statement with a semi-colon, the next
PRINT statement will start at the next available space; e.g.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
10 FOR A=1 to 5:PRINT A;:NEXT will give you:-
</p>
<p class="noindent">
1 2 3 4 5
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Note that a space is output in front of each number &ndash; if you PRINT a negative
number this space will be occupied by a minus sign.
</p>
<p>
A further modification, available within the PRINT statement itself, is the use of
commas to divide the output into zones. PRINT 1,2,3 puts 1 in position 0,2 in position
14 and 3 in position 28. If you not redefined WIDTH then the third zone is 20
characters wide. If a zone is completely filled or exceeded the instruction will still be
carried out but the cursor will then be moved to the start of the next free zone.
