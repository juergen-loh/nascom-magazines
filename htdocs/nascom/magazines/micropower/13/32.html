York Computer Club meets every Monday at the Holgate W.M.C., New
Lane, Acomb (Near the Carriage Works). Any new Nascom-owning members
would be very welcome, as the Nascom users are outnumbered by owners of
plastic boxes from Japan, U.S.A., and Cambridge. Ring Rupert Brown on York
(0904) 792023, evenings only, or drop in to the Club (bar prices are well subsidised!).
The Merseyside Nascom Group still meets on the first WEDNESDAY of
each month, in spite of a note to the contrary in one of the glossies. The next
meeting will be the Christmas Beanfeast, and it is hoped that representatives from
Lucas will be present. Meetings are held in the Mona pub, near Pierhead.
