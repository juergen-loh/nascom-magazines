Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I must congratulate Chris Blackmore on the clever software used by his
<a href="../../../12/12/text/#article1">Monitor.Com article</a>.
Readers may like to know that Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 can equally well be
adapted; however, the addresses at the top of page&nbsp;13 need to be changed as
follows:
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(2); ?>
<p class="indent2">
0800 &ndash; 00 00 00<br>
019B &ndash; 21 0A F8<br>
0236 &ndash; 11 0A F8<br>
023E &ndash; 11 BA FB
</p>
<?php columnChange(2); ?>
<p class="indent2">
0265 &ndash; 11 0A F8<br>
0268 &ndash; 21 4A F8<br>
0254 &ndash; 11 CA FB
</p>
<?php columnEnd(2); ?>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<p>
Key allocations need to be changed as well, as there are only two &lsquo;spare&rsquo; keys
available.
</p>
<p>
If a disc is used, then keys D, F, J, L, Y, Z will probably be unused for there
original purpose and several routines may be added, e.g., Handshake, Find,
Substitute, etc., as well as the extra routines in the article. At this stage I have
dedicated keys as follows:
</p>
<table class="indent2">
<tr><td>D</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Dump to disc</td><td>0788</td><td>change to 3B 09</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Find bytes</td><td>078C</td><td class="nowrap">change to 8F 0A *</td></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Load from Disc</td><td>0798</td><td>change to 06 0A</td></tr>
<tr><td>Y</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Return to CP/M</td><td>07B2</td><td>change to 15 09</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">
* Start address of my routine.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, it may not be necessary to type in all of the Nas-Sys as described.
If your Nascom can be switched from Nas-Sys to CP/M (see my article in
<a href="../../../../inmc-80-news/03/27/text/#article1">INMC80-3</a>),
copy Nas-Sys or Zeap, or whatever into middle memory (4000 to 8000 somewhere)
and switch to CP/M. Load in DDT or ZSID and you should still find your program in
memory. It can be copied down as required using the M command. Alternatively, if
you have R.COM and W.COM (Tape to disc Read and Write routines available from
Nascom Dealers) you can transfer your programs that way.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally I use to think that ED was a pig. Now that I am more used to it I
think it is a donkey &ndash; a bt hard to drive, but quite capable. One misses the screen
editing, which is not even restored by SYS6, but the Macro commands are very
useful.

P.S. I have almost got Zeap&nbsp;2 (RAM Version) and Naspen VS converted to work with
V.D.U. RAM at &pound;F800, but there are a few queer effects. Can anyone, without
infringing any copyrights, list the changes needed for 100% success.

Dear Sir
</p>
<p>
As I am at present working in Germany with the Forces I wonder if anybody else
out here has a Nascom; if so perhaps a mini Nascom Club could be started. If so
please contact me at the address below.
</p>
<p>
I have just acquired a Data Dynamics 390 printer, which appears to be normal
ASR33 teletype in fancy clothing. I have no circuit diagrams for this printer and do not
know how to interface it to my nascom. Can anyone help (Somebody must be using
an ASR33 with a Nascom).
