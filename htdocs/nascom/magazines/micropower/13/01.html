EDITORIAL
</h1>
<p>
We asked for your comments on the order forms for issues 3 and 4, and we hope
to discuss some of the points raised in details in the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue. However, the
answers did show what a wide range there is in the interests of Nascom Owners, and
in their levels of attainment. Many people said, in effect, don&rsquo;t publish articles for
beginners, don&rsquo;t print games programs, we want articles on advanced hardware and
software projects. But at least as many asked for simpler or more detailed
explanations of points which they felt were skipped over because the author
assumed they were too obvious to need expansion.
</p>
<p>
We are grateful to all those who took the trouble to send in their comments,
and also for the letters and articles that we have received. You can be assured that
all are read carefully, and that wherever possible we shall act upon the ideas you
send in &ndash; so please don&rsquo;t stop writing.
</p>
<p>
Many of you asked for games programs, so we shall try to include more of
these, although this will annoy the purists. In this issue we have included a program
by D. G. Johnson, the author of &lsquo;Graphic Golf&rsquo;. Although it is a simple and well known
game, it demonstrates brilliant use of the Nascom&nbsp;2 graphics set.
