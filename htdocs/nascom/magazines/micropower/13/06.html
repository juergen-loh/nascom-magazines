Secondly, POKE &amp; DOKE are often used to change options in the monitor. You will
know that under NAS-SYS the command K1 gives you lower case as the standard
print output. This can be achieved from BASIC directly, or in the course of a program
by the statement POKE 3111,1. Similarly, if you want to turn on output to your printer
in the middle of a program, you can use the various DOKE instructions outlined in the
manual. N.B. Different values apply in NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 from those in NAS-SYS&nbsp;1.

A third use might be to store a value which is to be picked up later by a machine
code subroutine. The example which follows allows you to generate sounds from a
BASIC program by flipping Bit 5 of the keyboard port.

<p>
Sub-routine:
</p>
<p>
6000 DOKE 3200,23533: DOKE 3202,3330: DOKE 3204, 19437
6010 DOKE 3206,3328:DOKE3208,8254:DOKE3210,211
6020 DOKE 3212,30731:DOKE3214,8369:DOKE3216,-4613
6030 DOKE 3218,75:DOKE3220,-20723:DOKE3222,211
6040 DOKE 3224,30731:DOKE 3226,8369:DOKE 3228,7163
6050 DOKE 3230,-19590:DOKE 3232,-7648:DOKE 3234,201
6060 RETURN
</p>
<p>
Main routine:
</p>
<p>
1000 GOSUB 6000:DOKE 4100,3200 (Dec. Addr.of M/C routine)
1010 DOKE 3330,X (where X=no. of complete loops)
1020 FOR I=A TO B, STEP C (where different values of A,B &amp; C
give different sounds)
1030 DOKE 3328,I:U=USR(0): NEXT I:
</p>
<p>
Memory location 3330 (0D02 hex) is DOKE&rsquo;d with the value which will control the
length of the sounds generated, while 3328 (0D00 hex) is DOKE&rsquo;d with the frequency
parameters.
</p>
<p>
Another use to which I have put these instructions was in the creation of an
array in a large program when I was short of memory. The original array was
something like A(8,8), i.e. 64 variables, requiring 6 bytes each. By using DOKE to put
values in memory and DEEK to retrieve them it was possible to use only two bytes
for each variable, e.g. if the start of the array is 3584, to put the value X into what
was previously A(I,J), you enter DOKE 3584+[16*(I-1)]+[2*(J-1)],X. The instruction is
a lot more cumbersome but there is still a significant saving in memory usage.

RANDOM NUMBERS
</p>
<p>
Random numbers are very useful in games programming, both in games of
chance like Pontoon or Fruit Machine and also in more complex programs like Star
Trek, where you wish to vary the results of selecting a particular option in the course
of the game.
</p>
<p>
The RND function does not, in fact, generate random numbers at all; it merely
starts with a pre-determined value and then produces new numbers according to a
formula. These values are always in the range 0 to 0.999999. If the argument used
