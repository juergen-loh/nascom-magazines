<p>
In setting out text on the screen or for printing there are a number of other useful
functions in BASIC which you can use with the PRINT statement, viz.
</p>
<p>
SCREEN X,Y&nbsp;. . . places the cursor on the Xth position across and Yth line down.
</p>
<p>
PRINT TAB(I) . . . moves the cursor to the Ith horizontal tab position.
</p>
<p>
PRINT SPC(X) . . . moves the cursor X spaces along from the current position.
</p>
<p>
POS(I) . . . reurns the current position of the cursor. This is useful where the cursor
might finish up in one of a number of different tab postions after following alternative
routes to reach the current program line. In order to obtain a satisfactory print layout
you could insert a line as follows:
</p>
<p>
20 R=POS(I):IF R&gt;25 THEN PRINT
</p>
<p>
Note (I) is only a dummy argument in this instruction, that is, because POS is a
function, not a command, it has the format of a function, but what you put within the
brackets is immaterial.

<p>
SPACE SAVING IN PRINT STATEMENTS
</p>
<p>
Since extra memory chips are so cheap these days saving space by shortening
Basic lines has few advantages. However, it is quite often annoying to find that you
are one or two characters in excess of 48 and therefore must have yet another line.
You will no doubt have discovered by now that in many situations it is not necessary
to use the second quotation mark when printing or defining strings. (e.g. [X$=&rdquo;FRED]
is acceptable as a statement on its own or at the end of a multiple-statement line.)
</p>
<p>
Now consider the following lines:
</p>
<p>
20 V=99:X$=&ldquo;15th&rdquo;:Y$=&ldquo;JAN&rdquo;:Z$=&ldquo;1981
30 PRINT&ldquo;Amount&rdquo;;V;TAB(25);&ldquo;Period &rdquo;;X$;&ldquo; &rdquo;;Y$;&ldquo; &rdquo;;Z$
T12&lsquo;15th&rsquo; and &lsquo;JAN&rsquo; require closing quotes but &lsquo;1981 &lsquo; does not. Line 30 will not fit
onto one screen line, and could only be entered by using direct entry of the singlebyte
reserved words from the keyboard, using the &lsquo;GRAPHICS&rsquo; key. But several
characters can in fact be left out since the second quotation marks can double for the
statement separators. i.e.
</p>
<p>
30 PRINT &ldquo;Amount&rdquo;V;TAB(25)&rdquo;Period &rdquo;X$&ldquo; &rdquo;Y$&ldquo; &rdquo;Z$
</p>
<p>
DEEK &amp; DOKE
</p>
<p>
Like PEEK &amp; POKE&nbsp;, DEEK &amp; DOKE allow you direct access to the data held in
