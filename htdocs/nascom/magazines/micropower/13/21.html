the switch to a high-impedance state. In the case of a <?php externalLink("2708","",""); ?>, only pin 20 can be used
to select the chip.

The circuit can be used to switch between two sets of graphics held in a single
4K EPROM &ndash; a 2532. Only one 24-pin socket is required, and the output from the
flip-flop is again connected to pin 18 of this socket &ndash; but in this case this is the top
address line, switching between the two sets of 2K graphics data in the ROM. If the
standard Nascom-2 graphics data is stored in the bottom 2K of the chip, pin 18
should be connected to pin 8 of the 74LS00.
