During the access the data to the V.D.U. is disabled by taking the enable lines to
ICs 10 and 11 to +5 volts. A monostable, IC&nbsp;16 can be used to lengthen the write
pulse to reduce flashes on the screen.

The <?php externalLink("2114"); ?> is a 1K x 4 bit static RAM, so a pair of 2114s needed for each 1K
bytes. Identical address lines on each of the four RAM chips are tied together, and
simlarly the eight data lines from the two pairs of chips are interconnected. When
an address is accessed data is only interchanged with the pair of chips for which
the CS signal is low, which is determined by the state of line 4 from the character
generator socket for V.D.U. access, and by the state of A10 for processor
access. The direction of the data transfer is determined by the WR signal.

The layout of the circuit is not particularly critical. The commonest problem is
caused by coupling between the lines from pins 21 &ndash; 24 of the character generator
socket. These lines carry signals derived from the crystal oscillator on the C.P.U.
board via a divider chain. If a long ribbon cable is used to connect the unit to the
main board interaction between these adjacent lines may cause screen Jitter.
Fortunately the solution is simple &ndash; just separate the lines from the main cable.

<h3>
MODIFICATIONS TO THE NASCOM
</h3>
<p>
The Nascom character generator socket has two unconnected lines. These
are used to connect bit 7 of the V.D.U. RAM to the unit and extra data output from
the unit. This does not affect the operation of the Nascom if the unit is disconnected
and the 6576 is replaced in its original socket. The following modifications
should be made to the Nascom board (IC numbers prefixed by an N refer to the
numbers used in the Nascom&nbsp;1 manual ).
</p>
<p>
Pin 11 of N IC&nbsp;17 should be bent horizontal so that it is not in contact with its
socket and connected to N IC&nbsp;15 pin 1. Similarly, pin 10 of N IC&nbsp;15 is bent
horizontal and connected to pin 10 of the character generator socket on the
Nascom. Pin 12 of N IC&nbsp;20 is connected to N IC&nbsp;17 pin 18 and pin 19 of N IC&nbsp;17 is
conected to pin 14 of the character generator socket. The connections to N IC&nbsp;15
are necessary because in the standard Nascom&nbsp;1 V.D.U. the last bit in each line
of the characters is set to zero; this leaves a gap between each character, which
is not wanted in the case of graphics characters. Please note that pin 11 of N IC&nbsp;17
and pin 10 of N IC&nbsp;15 are the only pins which should be bent (this is easier than
tracing tracks and then cutting the wrong one!).
</p>
<p>
The unit is designed specifically for a Nascom&nbsp;1. It should not be difficult to
adapt it for a Nascom&nbsp;2, because you already have a socket decoded for a graphics
ROM. I have not tried adapting the circuit because none of my friends with
Nascom&nbsp;2&rsquo;s will let me perform the necessary surgery!
