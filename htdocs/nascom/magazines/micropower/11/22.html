suitable time&nbsp;&ndash; in order to complete the access by the end of the 500 nanosecond
processor time slot.

Two other signals are generated. One (<?php invertedSignal("RVSEL"); ?>) is intended to gate the
address and data steering logic and permit a &ldquo;read-enable&rdquo; to reach the RAM.
The other (<?php invertedSignal("WVSEL"); ?>) is a signal timed to be contained within this, used to permit
a &ldquo;write enable&rdquo; to reach the RAM, with satisfactory data set up and hold timing. A
small capacitor can be fitted to lengthen this signal slightly&nbsp;&ndash; this is only needed for
slow RAMs and is included because some of the early Nascom&nbsp;1&rsquo;s might then be
able to use this approach.
</p>
<p>
On the implementation given, these signals are generated twice, for two
different address fields. One is the V.D.U. RAM, but some readers will be interested
in the possible application of the other. The club mentioned earlier has become
dissatisfied with the limited character set imposed by ROM-based graphics, so a
programmable character generator is being included as part of a P.C.B. we are
developing (The resulting board will be 8&Prime;x8&Prime;, Nasbus compatible, and also
contain 64K of RAM and a few other bells and whistles, for those interested). Now
the immediate use of programmable graphics is to download special characters
chessmen is a good example&nbsp;&ndash; from tape along with the software that uses them.
After that, however, is the rather more fascinating possibility of using this
programmability dynamically to produce smooth movement: watch your Klingons
grow in size in your starship viewscreen as they sweep in to the attack.
</p>
<p>
Our P.C.B. uses separately addressed RAM, which is expected to be regularly
accessed by both the video display logic and the processor, so the same conditions
exist as for the V.D.U. RAM. Not surprisingly, the same solution to on-screen
disturbances also applies; hence the second pair of signals. Since they require
no additional I.C.s for their generation, I have included them in the diagram.

<p>
The instructions constitute a modification for Nascom&nbsp;1, for which I won&rsquo;t
apologise: there are a lot of you, and also you have lived with the problem longer!
Nascom&nbsp;2 owners should have little difficulty in working out their own version, but if
there is sufficient demand then another article is always possible. To assist with
installation a sketch is included of the veroboard layout as fitted to my own
machine. It will be noticed that the connections to IC31 are made by adding
&ldquo;extension legs&rdquo; from the pins of the 7406 down through the veroboard. This
makes for space saving, wiring minimisation, and a certain amount of
mechanical support all in one, so is to be recommended. These extension legs
were taken from a broken DIL headers I suggest that you experiment and search
your Junk box.

In the instructions which follows &ldquo;Lift IC xx pin y&rdquo; means: carefully remove IC xx from
its socket, with a pair of thin, flat-nosed pliers bend pin y horizontal so that it no
longer makes contact with the socket, and replace. &ldquo;Connect pin of IC xx/y to &hellip;&rdquo;
means: solder one end wire directly to the pin bent horizontal in a &ldquo;Lift&rdquo; instruction.
