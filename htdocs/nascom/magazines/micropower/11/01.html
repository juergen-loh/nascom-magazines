EDITORIAL
</h1>
<p>
Why do we need a magazine for Nascom users? Firstly, there is a lot
happening on the Nascom front at the moment. In the face of what appeared to
be the imminent demise of the company many people who had been waiting for
promised &lsquo;goodies&rsquo; to appear started to produce their own add-ons. Lucas
eventually came to the rescue, but the death threat had by then has its effect.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, the popular computer magazines do not give Nascom the space that
Tandy, Apple, Pet, etc., etc., receive.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, the system&rsquo;s users are tremendously enthusiastic. In many local
computer clubs the Nascom owners are the most active group.
</p>
<p>
Finally &ndash; well, the answer might be that there is no place for the magazine.
Perhaps Nascom owners are more interested in communicating with the machine
than with other users. We shall soon find out, because the magazine will only
survive if people &ndash; that means you &ndash; will write about their enthusiasms.
</p>
<p>
So write &ndash; say what you liked and didn&rsquo;t like, tell us what you want to read
about, ask questions (and answer the questions of others), and above all write
an article, short or long, because that is one way to ensure that the magazine
contains topics that interest you.
