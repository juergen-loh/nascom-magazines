The Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 table contains a repeat keyboard routine, which is not available under
Nas-Sys&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p>
The next two restarts (relative call, &pound;D7, and subroutine call, &pound;DF) both use the
byte following the restart code to determine the address of the routine they are
accessing. In a relative call the second byte is used as an offset to the routine being
accessed, and as in the case of a relative jump instruction the distance is measured
from the code following the second byte. If the offset lies in the range &pound;80 &ndash; &pound;FF the
subroutine will precede the instruction calling it.

By using the relative call routine you can write programs that are completely
relocatable &ndash; that is, they will work at any address without modification. This is
particularly useful for programs that are to be stored in EPROM, as you can plug
the device in any spare socket. Of course, you don&rsquo;t get this for nothing; the routine
has quite a lot of software manipulation to carry out, and consequently it is much
slower than a normal subroutine call. So, if you want a program to run as quickly
as possible you will have to avoid relative calls in the critical parts of the code.
</p>
<p>
The subroutine call, &pound;DF, uses the second byte to access a table which contains
the addresses of monitor subroutines. In Nas-sys&nbsp;3 this table starts at &pound;0782; the
first 26 addresses are the routines for the single letter commands. Only F and L are
unused, and the table contains the address of the error-message routine for these
letters. If you have an EPROM blower you can add extra commands by using these
letters, or by replacing any of the standard commands that you don&rsquo;t use. As an
example, here is a routine which compares two blocks of memory and list four lines
of each block whenever it finds a difference.
