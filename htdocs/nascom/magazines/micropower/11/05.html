IS THERE ANYBODY OUT THERE?

<p class="continued">
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I am very interested in you new magazine from a club/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>school point of view.
However, I do not seem to be able to contact any user groups or computer clubs in my area,
and it is not through want of trying. There must be some Nascom Novices keen to form a
user group in the Berkshire area,

HELP WANTED
</h3>
<p class="continued">
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I have a Nascom&nbsp;2, I have read the manual, I have used PEEK and POKE in
programs &ndash; BUT &ndash; what am I doing? So PEEK looks at memory and POKE modifies memory;
why am I PEEKing and POKEing a particular number, what is the significance of that
number, what number do I need to poke for a specific task, how do I arrive at the correct
number, and, finally, why isn&rsquo;t there an index to such things?
</p>

<p>
* Alright, if that is what you want we will provide it.

<h3>
WRITE NOW
</h3>
<p class="continued">
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I would like to see the magazines:
</p>
<p>
a) Include information on the compatibility of the many add-ons that are now available
from Nascom, Gemini, Microvalue, Interface, etc.
</p>
<p>
b) Publish listings of the software from Gemini, etc., as many products do not come with
listings.
</p>
<p>
c) Publish an article on the history of Nascom
</p>
<p>
All the best with the new mag &ndash; I would rather have my Nascom than one of
those American or Japanese plastic boxes any day,
</p>
<p class="letters-address">
Yours Sincerely,<br>
C. F. A. Waller,<br>
Dunstable
</p>
<p>
* To provide a full listing with a product would add quite a lot to the cost and I don&rsquo;t think
firms would be very happy to see their software published!
</p>

MORE IDEAS
</h3>
<p class="continued">
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
In general I would like to read articles on the following topics;
</p>
<p>
1) Hardware problems that people have experienced, and their solutions.
</p>
<p>
2) Any special hardware interfacing.
</p>
<p>
3) Interesting and unusual programs.
</p>
<p>
4) Useful routines and clever solutions that have been devised to overcome some of the
machines shortcomings.
