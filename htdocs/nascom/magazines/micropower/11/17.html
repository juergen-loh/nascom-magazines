The enter key has a very important function; it tells the computer to scan the
line containing the cursor and carry out any legitimate command on that line.
However, computers tend to be very fussy about the commands they accept; if you
put the command in the wrong place, or make a mistake in spelling or punctuation,
you will upset it and it will come back at you with its favourite message &ndash; Error.

Screen Layout
</h3>
<p>
The Nascom uses a memory mapped display. This means that each
position at which a character can appear on the screen corresponds to a location
in a special region of the computers memory, often referred to as the VDU RAM
(the term &lsquo;RAM&rsquo;, and acronym for Acc ess Memory dating from the early days of
computing, is now used for any type of memory that can be modified directly by
the processor during the running of a program). To produce a character on the
screen you merely have to put the appropriate code into the correct location.
Special circuitry scans the display memory continuously and converts the data it
finds there into a signal which writes the characters on a TV screen. You can
change the contents of the display memory directly from the keyboard and watch
the characters appear. Clear the screen by typing shift/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>backspace, and then enter
M9E3, i.e., type M9E3 and then press &lsquo;enter&rsquo;. Make sure that the letter M is on the
far left of the screen, otherwise the computer will ignore it. If you have entered
the command to the computers satisfaction the cursor will jump to the next
line down the screen where 09E3 20 will be printed, with the cursor flashing at the
number 2. This shows that the current content of memory location 09E3, which
represents the middle of the screen, is 20 &ndash; the code for a space. If you now type
07, when you press &lsquo;enter&rsquo; this character replaces the space and a small bell-shaped
figure with two legs projecting downwards appears in the middle of the screen. You
will have noticed that with this method of entry the position at which the change
occurs is independent of the cursor location.
</p>
<p>
The screen can hold 16 lines of 48 characters. The top line is special; you will
find that you cannot move the cursor onto the top line by means of the control keys.
Of course, you can put data directly into the memory locations corresponding to
the top line; if you modify the contents of location BE3 to 07 the little bell will appear
in the middle of the top line. If you try to move the cursor off the bottom of the
screen, you will find that the screen &lsquo;scrolls&rsquo;, that is, the cursor stays on the bottom
line but all the data on the screen is moved up one line. However, the contents of the
top line are unchanged, and the data in the second line is lost. The top line is used
for headings, program names, etc. The Nascom screen is not mapped to the
display memory in a straighforward way; the start of the memory corresponds to the
second line of the display, it runs down to the bottom line, and it is then followed by
the top line. It is thus usual to refer to the scrolling part of the display as lines 1 &ndash; 15,
and the top line as line 16, which can cause some confusion until you become
used to it.
