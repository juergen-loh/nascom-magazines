&ldquo;Connect pad of ICxx/y to ...&rdquo; means: solder one end of wire to any suitable point on
the P.C.B. track that pin y used to connect to, before it was lifted. Plated through

Preliminary: Remove &ldquo;snowplough&rdquo; if fitted and restore board to its original state.<br>
1): Remove IC&nbsp;31. This 7406 may be used, if desired, on the veroboard, or
retained in case the 2102&rsquo;s are too slow<br>
2): Lift IC&nbsp;11 pin 5. Connect pin of IC&nbsp;11/5 to IC&nbsp;11/4<br>
3): Lift IC&nbsp;45 pin 13<br>
4): Lift IC&nbsp;36 pin 6<br>
5): Plug veroboard into IC&nbsp;31, ensuring that the 7406 has the same orientation as
originally. The major part of the board fits over the group of R&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s adjacent to
IC&nbsp;31, and between the PIO and the character generator. Subsequent instructions
assume that the switch is already wired in, and that wires using the colour code on
the logic diagram have been soldered to the veroboard.<br>
6): Connect pin of IC&nbsp;45/13 to WVSEL (black)<br>
7): Connect pin of IC&nbsp;36/6 to VDUSEL (blue)<br>
8): Connect pad of IC&nbsp;36/6 to RVSEL (white)<br>
9): Connect 1MHz pin adjacent to IC&nbsp;19 to 1MHz (brown)<br>
10): Connect 2MHz pin adjacent to IC&nbsp;19 to 2MHz (red)<br>
11): Connect 4MHz pin adjacent to IC&nbsp;19 to 4MHz (yellow)<br>
12): Connect IC37/24 to WAIT (green)

<b>NOTE &ndash;</b> Those of you who are using Nascom buffer boards are currently driving
their processors with a different oscillator to the on-board one driving the V.D.U,
logic, this being Nascom&rsquo;s solution to a bus skew problem. The modification
presented here cannot tolerate independent oscillators since it uses a
synchronisation technique, and continues to use the Nascom&nbsp;1 on-board oscillator
to drive the Z-80. The buffer oscillator must be disconnected in its entirety from
both the Nascom&nbsp;1 interface, pin 38, and the Nasbus, pin 5. The latter, if
connected to pin 11 of the 7406 on this modification, produces the same solution to
skew as the buffer implements &ndash; i.e., two gate delays. If you don&rsquo;t like flying leads,
and are prepared to do some P.C.B. track cutting, isolate the Nascom&nbsp;1 interface pin
38 and use this as a method of linking the signal from the Nascom&nbsp;1 to buffer and
hence to Nasbus.

When you have carried out the above modifications, try the system at 2MHz.
Any screen misbehaviour will probably show with &ldquo;tabulate&rdquo;, but experiment with
several programs making dynamic use of the screen. If misbehaviour is seen, fit
a 150 pf capacitor between pin 8 of the 7406 on the veroboard and ground. If the
system still doesn&rsquo;t work properly then your V.D.U. RAMs are too slow &ndash; either
get some faster 2102&rsquo;s or try an alternative suggested in the text. If all is well, and
providing that you are quite certain that your system can run at 4MHz i.e., it did so
before installing the modification &ndash; then carry out the same tests at the higher speed.
Hopefully, you now have a clean screen without any disturbances.
