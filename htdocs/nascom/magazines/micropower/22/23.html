equal to zero to signify the end of the prices for any one program. The routine
to enter the prices would skip an element, and the routine to calculate and print the
royalties would search for those elements equal to zero, and then move onto the next
program. The calculation is then [2(arr ays) x say 75(programs)] + 75(vacant
elements) = 225. Multiplying by the 6 bytes per element then gives 1350 bytes.
Phew!!

On reflection, this method might also be adopted in handling the program
name information. But since the program was written first and it works, we&rsquo;ll save
that up our sleeves, in case we need the space in some future enhancement.
We do not of course have to write one large program containing all the
options. The tasks to be done can conveniently be split into &lsquo;file maintainence&rsquo; i.e.
create, amend or delete the standing information, and the &lsquo;operating&rsquo; program
to enter the prices and numbers sold and print the letters and summary. However,
since space did not prove a problem, the program has been left as one complete
entity. The version which now follows has been more or less de-bugged, although
some improvements, for example, in the print layout, remain to be made.
In the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue I will cover some sections of the program in greater detail, and
discuss the operation of the Basic File Handler.
