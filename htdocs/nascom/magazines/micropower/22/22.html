the program names, the program prices and the numbers sold at each price. The
first two are essentially &lsquo;standing&rsquo; or file information. We will therefore need some
means of building up a file of these, together with routines to enter new data and
amend or delete existing data. My solution was to make use of Program Power&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Basic File Handler&rsquo; program, which gives amongst other things the ability to save
and load string data.
</p>
<p>
The numbers of each program sold must obviously be entered each quarter.
This leaves the price information. I established that, although there were perhaps
only 10 basic prices for programs, the variations discussed earlier could easily
multiply this by a factor of at least 10. Thus I thought it best to deal with this in the
same way as numbers sold.

Name and Address File &ndash; this can fairly simply be held as follows:
N$(I), A$(I), B$(I), C$(I), D$(I) &ndash; where N is the name; A, B &amp; C are a three line
address; and D is the telephone number, (strictly speaking not required for this
application). The subscript &lsquo;I&rsquo; will be used as a key effectively to the file of
authors.
</p>
<p>
As regards the programs, I decided to go for a two dimensional string
array, as this permits ease of handling. Thus, for a file of 30 authors (covering just
one of the micros), we have the array P$(I,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>J), where J is the key to the programs
of each author. Since there are very few authors who have more than two
programs, this is very wasteful of memory space, but as it is not a problem in this
particular case, the benefits of ease of handling will be allowed to take preference.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned earlier that the majority of the information has to be output
twice. This means that the price and numbers sold data must be held between
one print run and the next. Alternatively, it could be saved as a temporary file, but
this solution was not thought to be very elegant. My first solution to this problem was
to create two three- dimensional numeric arrays viz. P(I,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>J,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>K) to hold the prices and
S(I,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>J,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>K) to hold the relevant numbers sold. A quick calculation of 2(arrays) x
30(authors) x 20(programs) x 10 (prices) x 6 bytes per variable = 72000bytes
persuaded me I had better think again.
</p>
<p>
I then thought of the way in which the information will be used. The main
part of the program will start with the first author, deal with his programs in turn and
then move on down the list of authors until they have all been looked at. A solution
much less wasteful of space would therefore be to create two single tier arrays viz.
K(X) for prices and L(X) for numbers sold, with a variable element deliberately left
