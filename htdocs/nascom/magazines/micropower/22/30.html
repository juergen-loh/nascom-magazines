64K RAM ON A NASCOM RAM&nbsp;B BOARD

<p>
This article is aimed at the owner of a Nascom RAM-B board who wants to
increase the available RAM to the full 64K that the Z-80 microprocessor can
address. There may well be something of interest for readers who are considering
the modification of other boards populated with 4116 dynamic RAM chips; be
warned, however, that although the modified board will work on a Nascom&nbsp;2 or a
Gemini multiboard system, it will NOT work on a Nascom&nbsp;1 as described. The
modification uses the MEXT line, whih is essential to the correct operation of a
Nascom&nbsp;1. That said, there is no reason why some enterprising Nascom&nbsp;1 owner
should not circumvent this problem and find some suitable alternative way of routing
what we shall call the &lsquo;RAM BLK 3&rsquo; signal on the board
One of the very attractive features of Nascom products so far has been the
literature that the firm has published with their hardware, and I am assuming that
you have the circuit diagrams which came with the board when you bought it. In
particular, I shall be referring to figures 10, 11 and 12, which are the circuit diagrams
issued with the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions for the board, but it should be possible
to follow the gist of the theory behind the modification from this article alone. If you
are interested only in the practical aspects of &lsquo;how to do it&rsquo;, then the article should be
self explanatory.

The modification should not be beyond the skill of the average Nascom owner,
but I am well aware that for some who are new to the game, what I am proposing
may sound a bit daunting. For their benefit I shall take things rather slowly, and
I ask any old hands to bear with me if some of what I say is &lsquo;old hat&rsquo; to them. After
you have completed the modifications you will have a board which will support 64K
of RAM at 4&nbsp;Mhz without wait states, will retain the ability to &lsquo;write protect&rsquo; the
banks of 4116s, and will also retain the Nascom page mode of operation. For
several months I have been running such a modified board on my Nascom&nbsp;2, and
more recently I have used it also on a Gemini Multiboard system. What is interesting
is that I used 200 ns RAMs, apparently without any adverse effects, but if you add
up all the gate and delay-line times, you will realise that there is probably a certain
element of luck in getting the board to run at 4&nbsp;Mhz, and that the RAMs may be
running a bit faster than spec. Those of a weak disposition may consider the use
of 150 ns RAMs if they cannot bear the thought of the memory dumping at an
inopportune moment.

The modification involves soldering sockets or chips on top of other delicate chips
&ndash; with all the risks that entails. Many argue that the best way to do this is to wrap
a couple of layers of cooking foil around a spare piece of polystyrene tile and plug the
chip into the foil. This does two things; it &lsquo;commons&rsquo; all the pins of the chip, and it
helps conduct away heat and thereby reduces the risk of damage to delicate
connectors inside the DIL package. If you are short of space inside your Nascom
and there is not too much space between the boards, you may have to solder the
