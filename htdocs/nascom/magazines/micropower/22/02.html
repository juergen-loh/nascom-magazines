MODIFYING THE NASCOM&nbsp;2 BOARD FOR 2732 EPROMS

<p>
At present, 4K byte EPROMs offer the best value for money in ROM program
storage. For example, a number of retailers sell <?php externalLink("2732","",""); ?>s for around &pound;4.00 to
&pound;4.50. This article describes the modifications needed to fit 2732 EPROMs to
the Nascom&nbsp;2 main board, with bank selection to select one-of-four 8K byte
EPROM banks, or the Nascom Basic ROM.

<p>
The flexibility built into the Nascom&nbsp;2 board means that 4K EPROMs can be
fitted by rewiring the link blocks. The 2732 requires two extra address lines, wired
from the &lsquo;special&rsquo; link block, LKB9. Bank selection is done by a small board which
takes control of the chip select decoder, IC46. The bank selection board plugs
into the socket occupied by the memory selection links LKS, and needs 9
soldered connections to the main board. Bank 0 is always selected on reset, and
the active bank is changed by OUT 3, n, where n is 0 &ndash; 4 as required. Port 3 WR is
also spare on the Nascom&nbsp;2, and could be used to provide a safety interlock
against accidental bank switching.

The bank control board is shown in figure 1. The 74LS175 latch is a three bit
output port, strobed by the inverted PORT 3 WR signal from the I/O decode
PROM IC26. Latched data bits BS0 and BS1 are connected to pins 13 and 3 of the
chip select decoder IC46, to select one-of-four EPROM banks. These two IC pins
