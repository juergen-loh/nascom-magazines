upper chips directly on top of the lower chips, but otherwise you would be well
advised to solder DIL sockets for the upper layer onto the chips of the lower layer,
as only one chip is put at hazard, and you will retain the option to remove the top
chip easily in future. Before soldering on the top chip/socket, wrap it in a couple of
layers of foil as well, with the pins protruding through the foil. Again, the foil acts as
an insulator and heat sink.

One unfortunate by product of this &lsquo; recommended&rsquo; method is that when you
have finished you have to dig bits of cooking foil from between the pins of your
newly mated chips, and you may prefer to make yourself a Jig with a spare DIL
socket which has all its pins commoned in some scrap veroboard. One last thought
on piggybacking ICs; it is a good idea to make sure that pin 1 is clearly recognisable
from below on the bottom IC, otherwise just as you finish a beautifully neat soldering
Job, you realise that you can&rsquo;t remember having checked the orientation of the
bottom chip. If the end of the 4116 is not clearly notched, lightly scratch the
underside of the IC next to pin 1, or mark it with a small dot of marker dye; and do
this before you start any soldering.

Now for a quick look at the theory behind the modification. Fig. 12 of the
instructions which accompany the RAM-B board show the memory ICs arranged in
three banks of eight, with addresses commoned from the right of the diagram,
and data commoned vertically. On the left there are essentially three lines to each
bank; a column address strobe (CAS) which is common to all three banks, a unique
row address strobe (RASx) to each bank, and a write strobe (WRx), again unique to
each bank. The logic behind the latter two runs something like this. Each bank
MUST be individually addressed and if you want to create another bank then you
MUST create an additional RASx signal from somewhere. Since the existing
banks are numbered 0 &ndash; 2, with their associated RAS0 &ndash; RAS2 signals, it makes
sense to number the new bank 3, and call the new signal RAS3. The third signal is
the WRx signal, which must be taken low when whenever you (the CPU really!)
want to write to the respective bank. If the WRx signal is held high, bank x will
become write protected, and if the relevant pins of the upper bank are soldered to
those of the lower bank, the upper bank will take the same write protect status as
the lower. At this stage, let me state that it is possible to arrange for the new bank
of RAMs to have independent write protect&nbsp;, but to be frank, although I have run my
board in this condition, I have never found the need for separate write protect on
the new bank of RAMs, and in the end I Just removed the additional wiring as it was
a bit of an eyesore. For this reason, I shall not cover this aspect of the
modification, but if any reader is interested in the details, please contact me
through this magazine.

From what I have said, it should be obvious that all 16 pins of the upper and
lower 4116s can be commoned (is there really such a word in English?) except for
pins 4, which must be separated between banks but comoned along the new bank.
