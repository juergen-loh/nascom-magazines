PLANNING AND WRITING A PROGRAM

INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>
Program Power asked me if I had time to write a program to deal with the
administration of their royalty payments. I didn&rsquo;t have&nbsp;, of course. Nor did I have time
to write this article. However, like most computer enthusiasts, once a program
idea has got implanted in my tiny mind it tends to act like the proverbial cuckoo and
creates its own time and space. Here, therefore, follows the first results of my
deliberations.
</p>
<p>
THE PROBLEM
</p>
<p>
Program Power sells programs which in the main have been written by
individuals not employed by the company, these individuals being remunerated by
way of 20% royalties, calculated on the prices at which the programs are sold.
Including those for certain micros whose names may not be printed in this
magazine, there are t present approx. 100 programs being offered for sale, written by
say 50 authors, though the number per author varies from one up to sixteen. Each
Quarter the royalties payable are calculated according to number sold at the
company&rsquo;s selling price price.
</p>
<p>
If there were only one price for each program, then it could easily be
argued that the job could be handled by a competent clerk with a calculator.
However, in recent months, due to the sale of programs to trade customers, at
discounts varying with quantities sold, together with special offers to direct
customers, the number of different prices has grown enormously. A computerised
solution is therefore being sought before the Job gets into a tangle or consumes too
much valuable time.
</p>
<p>
OUTPUTS
</p>
<p>
When writing a program, I always look first at the &lsquo;outputs&rsquo; of the task, both
in terms of which pieces of paper have to be produced, and also the detail which
will appear on them. In this case there is firstly a statement to each author, giving his
name and address, the names of his programs&nbsp;,the number sold at each price, the
royalty calculated and the grand total payable. These, of course, are printed on
single sheets. The second output is a summary for each computer, listing the same
information without the author&rsquo;s addresses, and giving the overall total for that
computer. A continuous list is acceptable for this part of the Job.
</p>
<p>
INPUTS
</p>
<p>
The next stage is to look at inputs and to establish how they are to be made
available to the computer. The main inputs are the authors&rsquo; names and addresses,
