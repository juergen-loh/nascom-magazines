This completes the listing of the control software.
A number of errors have come to light in the previous articles. The first is
an error in the circuit diagram for the programmer power supply. The negative lead
of the 470uP, 64V capacitor should connect to the bridge rectifier AC input, not to
the positive output of the rectifier as shown.

<?php imageCenter($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-19-1.png"); ?>
<p>
Secondly, a link is missing from the vero layout. This is the link connecting
pin 24 of the 2708 socket to the +5v supply. One may be fitted in a similar way to
that on the 2716 socket.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, a series of minor errors occurred in the listing. There was a
superfluous right-hand bracket is assembler line number 144; it should read
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 70%">
<tr><td>144</td><td>LD (ROMFLG), A</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Line 150 was omitted and line 149 was wrong; this section should read
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 70%">
<tr><td>149</td><td></td><td>JR PROMPT</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>150</td><td>TYP2K</td><td>LD A, 08H</td><td>; FLAG FOR 2K EPROM</td></tr>
<tr><td>151</td><td></td><td>LD (ROMFLG), A</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
An incorrect address appeared in line 167; the correct address is 0A52H.
In line 216 the label TEXT7 was given as TEXT17. In line 293 a superfluous WAIT2
occurred at the end of the line; this of course is the label for the delay loop on line
294
</p>
<p>
Finally, note 1 on page&nbsp;20 of the last article could be expressed better as
follows:&ndash;

The layout is shown from the copper side. All components including
links are mounted on the other side of the board, except the links
mentioned in Note 5 and the two diodes in Note 6.
