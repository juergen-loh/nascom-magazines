eight pin socket on the rear panel, and that simply taking the required pin to logic
low briefly was enough to operate an internal latch which enabled the appropriate
function. This was eventually done direct from the Nascom output port, but could
easily have been done via a reed relay similarly driven. Only one modification
was made to the deck internally, and this was to bring a connection out from a
reed relay which monitored the tape digital counter, pulsing to logic low ten times
every digit. This enables ECOS to calculate tape speed, and hence use timing to
fast-forward and reverse the tape, to speed up searching operations.

Having achieved total control of the tape transport via the computer, the next
task was to decide upon the features to be included in the operating system, and
the additional information to be recorded at the start of the tape and as header to
each program stored. At the start of each tape there is a header which gives the
tape number and name, and at the start of each program on the tape there is a
header giving program number; name (up to 16 characters); type of record (machine
code, zeap file, basic, data file, erased); length of program; and execution address.
This information enables ECOS to create a catalogue on request by reading off the
headers, fast-forwarding automatically between programs, and fast rewinding when
the end of tape marker is found. Any tape errors which occur are handled
automatically by ECOS which rewinds one block and attempts to reread the faulty
block up to four times before abandoning it, leaving the standard &lsquo;?&rsquo; to denote an
unresolved tape error. This sometimes occurs with old tapes not recorded on the
deck. A dodge sometimes used in this case is to re-read the block with only one of
the stereo channels, and this usually retrieves the situation. Once recorded on
the logic deck via ECOS loading is usually foolproof, and the computer can be left
to &lsquo;do its own thing&rsquo;.

As it stands, ECOS is 3K long, and with additional refinements it is
intended to put it in EPROM and interface Nas-Sys to it, providing
ECOS functions direct from Nas-Sys. ECOS by its nature is
inherently machine-specific, but more details of the software will be
published if there is a demand.
