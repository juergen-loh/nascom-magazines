If the unit has been built according to the circuit diagram
you will find that it is addressable at ports 64 to 79 (don&rsquo;t
forget to switch to external port addressing). I enclose 2
demonstration programs written in Microsoft 80. The first is
called to initialise the clock. Lines 100-190 input the date and
time, and control the validity. Line 230 sets all bits of
register 14 to 0 thus stopping the clock. Lines 220-380 set up
the date and time in registers R4-R13. Note, I don&rsquo;t use
register 10, day of the week. Lines 330-370 set up the correct
value for the Leap year. Note, the astuce for detecting the year
on a 0 to S basis in line 330.

2&rdquo; &ldquo;42 " &rdquo; 13 to 2
=&rdquo; was " &ldquo; 13 tot
</p>
<p>
Finally, when all registers have been initialised, it
remains to start the clock by sending a 1 to register 14.
</p>
<p>
The second program is a demonstration of how the clock can
be read, once set up. Lines 520, 530 and 560 read data from the
11 registers, starting at register 2 (seconds (units)). Line 540
checks if data read is valid ie. that a value was present at the
Data Bus during the address period. Line 550 leaves the BCD
value. Lines 580-440 are just one example of displaying the date
and time.
</p>
<p>
Conclusion
</p>
<p>
As you will no doubt appreciate, there are many possible
uses for this clock, from simple time telling, although it does
make rather an expensive clock, to sophisticated timing
requirements in the case of automatic control functions. What
ever your choice, you will always have the time
