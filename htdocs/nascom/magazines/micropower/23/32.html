COORDINATE LIFE

The last <a href="../text/"></a>issue of Micropower contained a hex dump of a
machine code program headed &ldquo;Coordinate Life&rdquo;. This article
is an attempt to describe what the program does, how it does
it, and how to use it.
</p>
<p>
Life, the computer version that is, has been around for
several years now. It plots the evolution of a colony of
cells which obey a set of simple rules. By changing the
rules you can produce wide variations in the behaviour of
the colony, but the rules first published by J. H. Conway
seem to produce the most interesting patterns. Conways
rules are:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="number indent2">
<li>
The cells occupy a rectangular array (like the
squares of graph paper), and each cell has 8
neighbours
</li>
<li>
Each cell is in one of two possible states, alive
or dead!
</li>
<li>
If a living cell has no live neighbours, or only
one, it will die in the next generation
</li>
<li>
A living cell with four or more live neighbours
will die in the next generation through
overcrowding
</li>
<li>
An new cell will be formed in the next generation
on any empty cell with exactly three live
neighbours.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Although you can follow the evolution of simple
patterns with pencil and paper, it is much easier, and more
interesting, to use a computer to display the complex
behaviour that can be produced by these simple rules.
However, whatever the size of the display selected, the most
fascinating patterns always seem to become too big for the
screen. For example, using Pixel graphics the Nascom screen
can only display a 96 x 48 cell array, and many patterns
soon expand beyond these limits.
</p>
<p>
You can overcome the problem of a small display size by
letting the screen act as a window into a larger array. by
using the cursor keys to move the window asound you can
inspect any part of the array at will. You then run into
another problem &ndash; the memory capacity needed by a large
array. If each cell is represented by one byte, a 100 x 100
array would need nearly 10K of memory. Even if each cell
was represented by the state of a single bit, an array 1000
x 1000 would need more memory than the Z80 is capable of
addressing.
</p>
<p>
This program overcomes the capacity problem by only
storing the coordinates of the living cells. Because in any
colony the proportion of active cells is small, and tends to
decrease as the total population grows (i.e., the area
covered by the colony increases faster than the population),
you can store the coordinates of the active cells in quite a
