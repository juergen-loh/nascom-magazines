Blackburn and plots a very pretty picture.

If you alter the function in the SIN and COS evaluation you
can get some very interesting effects.

If anyone else has any of these nice little programs rolling
around at home, we would appreciate your sending them in so that
we can print them out and hang them on the stark office walis
that we have here at Micropower

Nasprint Modification.
</p>
<p>
If you try to use Nasprint with the RAM version of ZEAP, you
will find at keeps giving the message &ldquo;uninitiated&rdquo;. This is
because it tests memory location 0C7? ta check that &ldquo;DC&rdquo; has
been put there by ZEAP. However, the RAM version puts &ldquo;1D&rdquo; there
instead when cold started. Also, after checking that ZEAP is
started, Nasprint attempts to return control by jumping to DOOS.
The call for RAM ZEAP is 1003. Therefore, to make Nasprint work
properly with RAM ZEAP we must change the locations BI4F and
B17D in Nasprint to 1D and 10 respectively. This can be done
using the Modify command if Nasprint is in RAM but an EPROM
programmer is required 1f you have an EPROM version.
