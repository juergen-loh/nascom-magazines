<h3>
SCAL NOM, DF 71
</h3>
<p>
All input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output in Nas-Sys is controlled by tables of
routines. If you want to change the sequence of operations
carried out on output you merely have to set up a new table,
which must consist of a list of the numbers of the
subroutine calls to be carried out terminated by a null, and
then tell Nas-Sys where this table starts by loading the
address into the HL register pair and calling NOM.
</p>
<p>
The address of the new table is first saved on the
stack and the address of the current output table is loaded
into HL from the output table pointer at &pound;0C73. The
contents of HL are now exchanged with the top two bytes of
the stack; thus HL now contains the new output table
address, and the stack holds the current address. Finally,
the new address is stored at &pound;0C73, becoming the address for
all subsequent output operations, the old address is POPped
of the stack into HL, and the subroutine ends.
</p>
<h3>
SCAL NIM, DF 72
</h3>
<p>
This subroutine operates in the same manner as DF 71 to
change the address of the input table, which is stored at
&pound;0C75.
</p>
<h3>
SCAL ATE, DF 73
</h3>
<p>
This subroutine call is used by input and output
procedures to get the routine numbers from the appropriate
tables and call them in turn. On entry to ATE the address
of the appropriate table pointer, &pound;0C73 for output and &pound;0C75
for input, should be in HL. However, before ATE is used
within Nas-Sys, the original contents of HL are saved on the
stack; consequently, if you try to use ATE from a machine
code program you will find that there is an extra POP
instruction at the end which throws away your return
address, creating havoc. Of course, there is no need to
call ATE, because the standard input and output routines in
Nas-Sys, SCAL IN (DF 62) and ROUT (F7), jump directly to ATE
after saving HL.
</p>
<p>
The address stored at the table pointer is loaded into
DE, and the routine numbers are then picked up successively
from the table until the null that marks the end is
detected. The routines in the table are called differently
by the two versions of Nas-Sys. In Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 the routine
number is stored at ARGC (&pound;0C0A) and the routine executed by
calling SCALJ (DF 5C). In Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 the number is
transferred to the E register and the routine is called via
SCALI.
