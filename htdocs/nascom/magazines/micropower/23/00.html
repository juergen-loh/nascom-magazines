64 KILOBYTE RAM
and
BUFFER CARD
with PROGRAMMABLE GRAPHICS
</p>
<p>
This 64K ROM card is surtable for the Mascon 1 or 2. The double sided glass-fibre P.C.B., 302 mas (12
ins.) by 203 mas (8 ins.), holds up to 4 blocks of 16 Kb dynanic RAM (4116), When all four blocks are fitted
the whole of the Z80 address field is occupied by RAM. The on board sapper allows parts of this address field
to be selectively inhibited in either read or write aode, or both, The aapper divides the address field into
4K blocks, and any two selected blacks can be further subdivided into 2 x 2K blocks.
</p>
<p>
The graphics section is entirely separate fron the dynasic ROM, but it can be mapped in at any chosen 2k
boundary. It can use an EPROM (2718) to give a pre-programsed character set, or static RAM (2 x 4118, or
4116) to provide user-progransable characters.
</p>
<p>
For the Nascoa 2 the aenory and graphics section can be separated fron the &lsquo;buffer* section; the
resulting 8 x 8 card can be plugged into a standard Nasbus (80-bus) edge connector For the Kastoa 1 the bottos
8x 4 ins. section of the card provides full buffering between the Nascoa 1 43-way connector and Nasbus. In
addition the following extra facilities are also provided:
</p>
<p>
1 Power-on juapy this allows the processor to execute @ prograe at any preset 4 boundary on
power-on or reset.
Synchronised Reset; the reset pulse 15 synchronised with the processor MI cycles, to
prevent corruption of data in dynanic RAM
Wait state generator; one wait state can be added to sesory or input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output access
ROH socket; a 28 pin or 24 pin socket can be placed at position BY, and via a series of
links this can accoasodate a 2716, 2752, 2784 or the standard Nascoa Basic ROM
Input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>outputs a partial decode is provided which allows for 64 input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output addresses,
