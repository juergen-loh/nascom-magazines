C contains the checksum for the data, and HL points to the
next byte following the data. Note that if B is zero on
entry, 256 bytes will be output.

<h3>
SCAL XOUT, DF 6E
</h3>
<p>
XOUT provides facilities for communication with
external serial devices. On entry the contents of the
accumulator are saved on the stack and HL is set to point to
$XOPT (&pound;0C28), which is the byte used to store the flags for
the various options available with XOUT. The value stored
at $XOPT is controlled by the X command; it is also affected
by characters input via the XKBD routine.
</p>
<p>
The state of bit 7 of XOPT is first tested. If bit 7
is 1, the character is not output and the routine terminates
by resetting bit 7 to zero (so that only one character at a
time is suppressed) and recovering the accumulator from the
stack. If bit 7 is zero, the character is output by a call
to an external serial output routine&nbsp;, XSOP, before the
routine is terminated as above.
</p>
<p>
XSOP outputs the character in the accumulator by a
relative call to a subroutine, XSOP0. Here the accumulator
is ORed, which sets the zero flag if the accumulator
contained a null (00). In Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 the subroutine is
terminated if a null is found; thus the Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 External
output routine will not send nulls. In Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 however
the Return on Zero instruction has been omitted, and nulls
can be output.
</p>
<p>
A second effect of the OR A instruction which starts
XSOP0 is to set the parity/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>overflow flag if the number of
bits in the accumulator which are &lsquo;1&rsquo; is even; otherwise the
parity/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>overflow flag will be reset. If the parity of the
accumulator was odd, the output routine now changes the
state of bit 7; the result is that the accumulator now
contains a code of even parity, the bottom seven bits (bits
0 &ndash; 6) representing the ASCII character to be output.
</p>
<p>
Next bit 0 of &pound;0028, the external option byte, is
tested; if this bit is zero, the character is to be output
with even parity, and the routine jumps straight to the
final section, where SRLX is called. However, if bit 0 of
&pound;0028 was 1, bit 7 of the accumulator is first inverted, so
that all output is of odd parity.
</p>
<p>
After return from subroutine XSOP0, the routine is
terminated, unless the character that has just been output
was a Carriage return. In this case, bit 4 of the option
byte is checked, and if it is zero the accumulator is loaded
with the line feed code (&pound;0A); this is then output by a
&lsquo;fall through&rsquo; to XSOP0.
