Although I have had my Nascom&nbsp;2 for over 2 years, I must
declare that I am still a beginner and this article is written
for those who, like me, find they have much to learn.
</p>
<p>
After having played about with the usual gimicks&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Space
Invaders&rdquo;, &ldquo;Stock Car Racing&rdquo;, drawing lines on the screen
etc., I decided to make the machine earn its keep or at least do
something useful. My daughter, a professional photographer,
wanted a system to keep tabs on her, literally, thousands of
photographs, so, I decided to invest in a disc system. Having
read up all the articles on discs and DOS, and all the adverts
off I went ta the local Nascom dealer who sold me a Pertec
single density, FD250 dis&nbsp;c drive and a
<?php externalLink("GM809","G809"); ?>
Gemini controller card.
</p>
<p>
The question then was&nbsp;&ndash; What operating system?&nbsp;&ndash; CP/M or
something else? The &ldquo;something else&rdquo; was PolyDos which the
dealer said would enable me to use my own programs as well as
everything else. So, for &pound;80 plus VAT I got my PolyDos. It
consists of 2 EPROMs, a 5 1/2 inch floppy with the controlling
programs and a manual.
</p>
<p>
Well, home I went with my purchases. First, to connect the
drive. The G809 is an 80-bus card. When my Nascom was built we
hadn&rsquo;t allowed for an extension of the bus. However
fortunately, the pins on the main board edge connector had not
been cropped and were long enough to allow a second piece of
Vero board to be fitted. So with a bit of engineering, the
G809 card was fitted and the ribbon cable from the Pertec drive
plugged in.
</p>
<p>
Next, the PolyDos EPROMs had to be fitted. The manual gives
several options for this. I used the Nascom&nbsp;2 main board block
B. On LKB6, you connect pins 8 to 12, 7 to 11, 6 to 10 and 5 to
9. Then on LKS1, the manual says &ldquo;connect pins 6 to 7 for XROM
and 6 to 10 for D000-DFFF. This rather threw me and I probably
connected both. However, I inserted the EPROMs, PD2A in socket
B5 and PD2B in socket B6. Power up and &ldquo;Hey Presto&rdquo;, up comes
&ldquo;Boot which drive&nbsp;?&rdquo;. (No one told me what &ldquo;boot&rdquo; meant!!)
</p>
<p>
Now the next stage is to hit &ldquo;0&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; which I did. Nothing
happened, no joy on the disc drive&nbsp;&ndash; all dead as a doornail. So,
off to the dealer with my equipment. Now, unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t
know exactly what he did but I think he altered the connections
on LKS1. They are now as follows:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="indent2">
1 to 16<br>
2 to 15<br>
4, 7 and 10 all together<br>
8 to 9
</p>
<p>
I suspect he also made some alterations to the RAM board as,
somehow, you have to have some RAM available at C000H. However,
it worked! Enter DIR;ELD, hit Enter and up comes the list of
files on the master disc.
