Solder wire 6 to pins 2 and 4 of IC&nbsp;71.

<li>
Finally place the Snowdinger 2 board into IC&nbsp;49&rsquo;s socket
using the long legs of the wire wrap socket

<p>
Check all your connections and when you are satisfied that
they are correct, try your Nascom at 2&nbsp;Mhz. Test the circuit
using the Tabulate command, then, if all is well, try the system
at 4&nbsp;Mhz. If the circuit worked well at 2&nbsp;Mhz but not at 4 tHhz
there are 2 possibilities:
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis indent justify" style="counter-reset: section 0">
<li>
There is a wrong connection on the Snowdinger.
</li>
<li>
The VDU RAM is too slow.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Check all your work, if no faults are found, it is likely
that you have slow RAM. On the circuit diagram there is an
alternative connection for one of IC&nbsp;1&rsquo;s gates which is in the 4&nbsp;Mhz
signal path. Making this change will increase the access
time at 4&nbsp;Mhz but it will increase the risk of static hazards as
mentioned previously. Alternatively you could get a faster 4118
RAM. This should be considered as a last resort as the first
solution is simpler and cheaper.

<p>
Hopefully, by now your screen is clear at both 2 and 4&nbsp;Mhz. Try
playing Invaders or some other program that makes dynamic use of
the screen, you&rsquo;ll wonder why you put up with screen flash for
so long.

NOTE &ndash; Sheet 1 in the Nascom&nbsp;2 manual shows IC&nbsp;7 as an inverter.
This is an error as IC&nbsp;7 is an 81LS97 which is a buffer. Nascoms
clock is not the inverse of that supplied by the Snowdinger 2,
but a buffered version. One small alteration that can be made to
improve the shape of the clock is connecting a 220&nbsp;ohm resistor
from pin 5 of IC&nbsp;11 to +5&nbsp;volts (pin 14 of IC&nbsp;11).
