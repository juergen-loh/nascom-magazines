is probably the easiest. Check that you still have +5V on your
Monitor and BASIC ROM and other RAM/ROMs in the vicinity. (I
didn&rsquo;t when I did it.)
</p>
<p>
Next, obtain a 74LS156 and fit it an place of IC 44 (which
is at present a 7415155 of which the 7418156 15 an Open
Collector version). This is necessary to allow correct power
down operation. Fit 8 of 1K resistors between pin % and pin 4 of
each Link block UKB1 &ndash; @. This provides the Gpen Coliector
pull-up to the new battery backed, 5V supply, when it 15
fitted.

<p>
Now for the back-up supply. This is best done by reference
to diagram 2 where the normal SV supply can be obtained from the
test pins near the bus connector and where the mew SV supply is
connected to the new RAMS and pull-up resistors ONLY. (It is
warth noting that another HMe116 could be fitted in place of the
Monitor and Video ROM/RAMSs and, by the connection of the back-up
supply and the addition of Write strobes, you would be able to
change Monitors and Video/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Graphics at will and not loose their
contents on power down, therefore mimicking the present ROMs.
Write Inhibit switching 15 recommended as there can be no
guarantee that spurious writes to the Cmos RAM wil not occur
during power up and power down. However, to date I have not
experienced any problems in this respect and have tried to
provoke spurious errors without &ldquo;success&rdquo;. To be certain, ALWAYS
DISABLE WRITE BEFORE POWER UP OR POWER DOWN. I have not thought
of a failsafe, software controlled Write Disable. If it could be
incorporated, it would open a few more avenues for use.

Having now had this facility on my system for some while, 1

now wonder how I got by before it was fitted, and the time spent
getting it right was well worth it.
