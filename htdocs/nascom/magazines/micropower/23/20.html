is probably the easiest. Check that you still have +5V on your
Monitor and BASIC ROM and other RAM/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>ROMs in the vicinity. (I
didn&rsquo;t when I did it.)
</p>
<p>
Next, obtain a 74LS156 and fit it an place of IC&nbsp;44 (which
is at present a 74LS155 of which the 74LS156 is an Open
Collector version). This is necessary to allow correct power
down operation. Fit 8 of 1K resistors between pin 3 and pin 4 of
each Link block LKB1&nbsp;&ndash; 8. This provides the Open Collector
pull-up to the new battery backed, 5V supply, when it is
fitted.
</p>
<p>
Now for the back-up supply. This is best done by reference
to diagram 2 where the normal 5V supply can be obtained from the
test pins near the bus connector and where the new 5V supply is
connected to the new RAMs and pull-up resistors ONLY. (It is
worth noting that another <?php externalLink("6116","HM6116"); ?> could be fitted in place of the
Monitor and Video ROM/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>RAMs and, by the connection of the back-up
supply and the addition of Write strobes, you would be able to
change Monitors and Video/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Graphics at will and not loose their
contents on power down, therefore mimicking the present ROMs.
Write Inhibit switching is recommended as there can be no
guarantee that spurious writes to the Cmos RAM will not occur
during power up and power down. However, to date I have not
experienced any problems in this respect and have tried to
provoke spurious errors without &ldquo;success&rdquo;. To be certain,
<span class="uppercase">always disable write before power up or power down.</span>
I have not thought of a failsafe, software controlled Write Disable. If it could be
incorporated, it would open a few more avenues for use.
</p>
<p>
Having now had this facility on my system for some while, I
now wonder how I got by before it was fitted, and the time spent
getting it right was well worth it.
