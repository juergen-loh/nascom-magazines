AS=1, A5=0, A4=0 and A7=0, giving access to the 16 registers
from address 40H to 4FH (hex). The data-out, in BCD form, is
present on the data lines DO-DS. R/W signals are directly
connected to the control BUS of your Nascom.

IC 3 is only required by the &ldquo;sporty&rdquo; Nascoms running at 4
Mhz. (You mean all Nascoms don&rsquo;t run at 4&nbsp;Mhz??-Ed). It provides
a Wait signal of approxiamately 1uS to allow the MM 58174 time
to output data to the Data Bus. The DBDR signal is not needed by
the Nascom&nbsp;2&rsquo;s and I am not too sure if it is in fact needed by
all versions of Nascom 17s. (see Nascom Doc

AS previously mentioned, 2 Ni-Cad batteries are used to keep
power on during computer &ldquo;days off&rdquo;. These are kept charged via
Ti and Ri when SV is applied to the circuit. In &ldquo;stand-by&rdquo; made,
the diode Di ensures that the 2.2V powers the MM 58174. It is
necessary, when SV operations cease, that the /WR, pin 3, is
kept at a sufficiently high potential to stop any random writing
to the MM 58174 registers. R4 provides this potential and the 2
NOR gates, connected in series, provide the necessary isolation
from the computers Control Bus. Finally, the variable capacitor
VC1 allows accurate callibration.

Construction

I think anyone attempting to build the clock will already
have sufficient skill to work out a simple Vero board layout. In
view of the small number of components, it should not be
difficult. Myself, I used a 10cm x 12cm wire wrap board. There
was enough space for all the components and the Ni-Cad batteries
housed in a plastic container (transistor radio type). As I have
a &ldquo;home built&rdquo; case for my Nascom, I found no difficulty
installing the board, wiring it directly into the Nascom Bus.
