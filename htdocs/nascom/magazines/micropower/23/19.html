So, after this extended introduction, I will proceed to
enlighten those interested parties on how it is done. It is
based on using up the 8 EPROM/RAM sockets on the Nascom&nbsp;2 main
board. The 8 sockets will accomodate most byte wide, 24 pin
devices and the HM6116s fall into this category. For straight
forward RAM expansion without battery back-up and Write Disable,
fitting is very similar to fitting 4118s in these positions
except that a higher order addressing is required to access all
the available memory. The only additional circuitry is to
provide RAM-Dis onto the Nascom&nbsp;2 to disable this new RAM if you
are using external RAM or ROM at the address chosen to locate
your new RAM. It is suggested that this stage be done first
anyway. to check that the RAM is operating correctly, before
introducing the complexities of the power down and Write
Disables. Refer to the link block diagram in your manual (you
have got a manual, haven&rsquo;t you!!) and connect pin 8 to pin 4
(chip select), pin 6 to pin 2 (output enable to read enable),
pin 5 to pin 1 (write enable) and finally, loop pin 7 (address
line A10) along each pin 7 and pick up address line A13 off the
data bus (best done from pin 12 of IC&nbsp;47 (N2MD)). This has the
effect of addressing through all the lower 1Ks of each chip and
then through the upper 1Ks of each chip (the upper and lower
halves of each chip are seperated by 8K) and is the simplest way
to do it. Finally, to make the whole thing go, connect the
RAM-gates to the blocks of addresses required eg. D000 to F000
would give you 16K of RAM starting at D000 and finishing at FFFF
so, if you are using a CP/M type system, then set your 48K card
to go from 0000 ta CFFF and you will have 64K on-line by
connecting either RAM-G1 or RAM-G2 to block address C000 + D000
+ E/F000 strapped together (the last 8K block is normally used
to enable the BASIC ROM). To provide RAM-Dis onto the p.c.b.
requires two ICs, one type 74LS32 (quad OR) and one type 74LS04
(hex inverter) and these devices will be used to provide the
Write Disable control as well (you might as well go the whole
hog!). In my system, these are mounted piggy back, on top of two
other conveniently situated 14 pin ICs close to the link block
LKS1, to which most of the connections will be made. Remove IC&nbsp;18
(74LS06), bend up pin 13 and then replace the IC. For the
remainder of the connections it is best to refer to circuit
diagram 1 alongside the Nascom&nbsp;2 Memory circuit diagram, top
left corner, where all the original circuitry will be found. I
would suggest that you now test, very carefully, the operation
of your new RAM, both with EPROM cards and other peripheral
cards occupying the same address space in both enable and
disable in case there is any interaction. My own system has been
operating for many months and I have had no problems. NOTE that
the linking is altered so that the Write Enable is linked to the
Write Disable switch.

Now for the tricky bit, battery back up cooection. It is not
difficult, just time consuming and some care is necessary to
ensure that the correct connections have been made. The idea is
to isolate all of the +5V connections to pin 24 of each chip and
also, to pin 3 of the associated link blocks. This can be done
by cutting about five tracks and adding a few wire links. I
would have included details but it now very difficult to gain
access to the underside of my N2 card and I have no record of
what I did &ndash; however, I would be pleased to reinvent the wheel
if anyone wishes to take the plunge. Otherwise, lifting IC legs
