<h3>
SCAL SPACE. DF 69
</h3>
<p>
This subroutine call outputs a single space by loading
the accumulator with &pound;20 and calling the ROUT restart, &pound;F7.
The section of code which does this is the end of routine
TBCD3 (DF 66), which outputs a space after the contents of
HL have been printed in hexadecimal.
</p>
<h3>
SCAL CRLF, DF 6A
</h3>
<p>
A carriage return/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>line feed is output by loading the
accumulator with &pound;0D and calling restart ROUT. The code
used is the end of the next, &lsquo;Error message&rsquo;. subroutine.
</p>
<h3>
SCAL ERRM, DF 6B
</h3>
<p>
This subroutine prints the word &lsquo;Error&rsquo;. followed by a
Carriage return to position the cursor at the start of the
next line. This call is very useful for reporting input
errors in machine code programs. Just print the type of
error and call DF 6B; this saves six bytes (&lsquo;Error&rsquo; + CR/LF)
by the use of two.
</p>
<h3>
SCAL TX1, DF 6C
</h3>
<p>
The main use of this subroutine call is to print out
the header on each block of data for tape input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output. The
start address of the block is in the HL register pair, the
length of the block in E, and the block number in D. After
the header data has been received from or sent to tape it is
printed out using DF 6C; the routine sums H, L, D and E into
the C register, and the value obtained is used as a checksum
by the Read and Write routines. SCAL TX1 really consists of
a single routine which prints out the contents of HL by a
call to TBCD3 (DF 66) and then exchanges the HL and DE
registers. Because this section of code is preceded by a
relative call to itself (D7 00), it is carried out twice
The result is that first HL is printed. HL and DE are
transposed, then DE is printed and HL and DE are restored to
their original positions. If you use this subroutine and
need the checksum, you must first set register C to zero.
</p>
<h3>
SCAL SOUT, DF 6D
</h3>
<p>
This routine sends up to 256 bytes of data to the
serial output. On entry HL must contain the address of the
start of the data to be sent, and the number of bytes must
be in B. The C register is first set to zero, then each
successive byte is added into C and sent to the serial port.
using SCAL SRLX, DF 6F. On exit from the routine B is zero,
