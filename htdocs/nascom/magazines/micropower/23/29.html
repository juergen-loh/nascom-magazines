Facilities 0, 2 and 3 are self-evident but the Reverse
Alphanumerics requires some explanation. The graphics bit, Bit
7, is re-routed to provide the reverse signal, so that Graphics
and Reverse Alphanumerics cannot be on the screen at the same
time. The difference between ASCII &ldquo;A&rdquo; (41) and ASCII reverse
&ldquo;a&rdquo; is 80 so that with Bit 1 of the Port low, Ci will give
reverse &ldquo;A".
</p>
<p>
Programming in machine code is simple, as all that is
required is the addrtian of 80 ta the ASCII cade for a letter or
number. This can be done using the comma before a letter in the
Modify mode and then pressing the Graphics key with the letter
if you have the modified keyboard described in Micropower:
Volume 1, Number 2. (A superb modification. The mast difficult
part being the cutting aut of the keyboard case for the extra
keys. Alsa, if you, like me, do things and then think about
them, please note that it is the zero key and not the O key that
is modified.)
</p>
<p>
Programming the Reverse Alphanumerics 1 BASIC is simple if
you have the Graphics key but some string manipulation is
required 1f you haven&rsquo;t, 1m order to set Bit 7. The following is
@ suggestion but could, I am sure, be improved.
</p>
<p>
SS REM SET UP ORIGIN AND DESTINATION STRINGS
&ldquo;Hel Lo&rdquo;: B!
20 FOR I=1 10 5
25 REM SET BIT 7 OF EACH CHAR. IN ORIGIN STRING
30 BS=E$+STRE (ASC (MIDS (AS, I, 1) +128) )
</p>
<p>
40 NEXT I
</p>
<p>
The Reverse Alphanumerics work regardless af the screen
background, so that black letter on a white background are
produced 1f the screen background is black and vice versa. One
thing that I should mention about RA is that the top of each
</p>
<p>
character is on the top row of the line so that if, for
instance, &ldquo;E&rdquo; 15 in RA below a normal line, then the top bar
will tend to merge with the line above. However, this a very
cheap modification and some snags can be expected. For
</p>
<p>
perfectionists, a similar commercial product is available
costing, I believe, about &pound;40.

&ldquo;Not another Othello&rdquo;, I hear you say. Yes, it is, but this
15 a very nice version, written 1n machine code for Nas-sys, 1t
executes at 1000H and has a nice feature called &ldquo;Hint&rdquo; which you
get by pressing the Space Rar on your move. Beware though, it
plays a mean game.
