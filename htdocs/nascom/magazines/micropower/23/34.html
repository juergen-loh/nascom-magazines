Such an arrangement can be stored for later recall by
entering U followed by S (for User pattern Save). These
patterns are stored in a reserved region of memory starting
at &pound;1A55. A series of patterns can be stored until the
reserved space is full. If the pattern has been stored
successfully the screen will clear, but if there is
insufficient space for further storage the pattern will
remain on the screen. You can clear the user space by
entering UC; UW will write the data in the user space to
tape, and UR will read a tape back in.

To follow the evolution of an arrangement just press G.
If part of the pattern moves off the screen you can stop the
process at any stage by holding down the space bar: then you
can move the window to the area that interests you and
restart. If the whole pattern interests you, but it becomes
too big for the screen, you can zoom in and out with I and
O, after stopping the evolution, and restart. The zoom
factor is displayed on the top line. Whenever the evolution
is stopped, you can clear the screen and start to re-enter a
new patterns by entering J.

<p>
Many life patterns move about the screen while
maintaining their shapes (for example, standard patterns f,
w, x, y and z); you can follow this movement by setting the
display to &lsquo;pan&rsquo;. If you type P, then press the cursor keys
to indicate the direction (left followed by up will give a
diagonal movement), and finally enter a number between 1 and
&pound;0C for the number of generations between each screen
movement, when you start the evolution the screen will
follow the pattern at the specified rate. Entering P0 will
turn off the pan option.
</p>
<p>
If you don&rsquo;t want to think up your own patterns
entering Y will generate small random patterns for you to
follow. However, only a small proportion of such patterns
do anything interesting.
</p>
<p>
The remaining commands, H and L, switch between high
and low resolution, You can only use them if your system is
fitted with a PCG. In high resolution each cell is
represented by a single dot, so on an unzoomed display the
resolution is 384 x 240 (the top line still contains the
header). By using the Zoom facility you can increase this
to more than 3000 x 1900! However the code is written for
for a PCG situated at &pound;0000, so some modification will be
rquired to make it work with different systems.
