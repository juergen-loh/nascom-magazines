This circuit, for both Nascom&nbsp;1 and 2, gives port control
</p>
<p>
ever Background Colour (0), Reverse Alphanumerics (1), Screen
Blanking (2) and Graphics Switching (3). The latter may be
required when graphic cades have been used in machine code
programs assuming that no graphics are available. (eg. the
</p>
<p>
Othello program in an early edition of INMC &gt;
</p>
<p>
The circuit in figure 1 shows how this is achieved using
only 3 TTL chips, and the truth table of figure 2 shows how the
Exclusive-OR gate can be used as an inverter. If A is low then
C=B but 1f A is high then C=/B.
</p>
<p>
In the following description of the construction, the ICs
referred to within the square brackets, CJ, are on the Nascom t
board and those in round brackets, (), are on the Nascom&nbsp;2. Note
that I have a Nascom&nbsp;1 and that the Nascom&nbsp;2 connections are
taken from the circuit diagram, but I believe them to be
correct.

The prototype was constructed on Veroboard and the layout 15
shown in figure 3. The power supplies and port connections were
taken by a e-way ribbon cable to a 16 pin DIL header plug which
was plugged into Skt a, Port 4. As the prototype was added to an
Econographics board, the Serial In connection was made to the
bent up pin of IC 5/6 and the Serial Qut connection plugged into
the socket. [On a Nascom without the Graphics, IC 15/9 provides
the Serial In in the same way.3 (Nascom&nbsp;2 IC 45/9)
</p>
<p>
The switch or link on the Econographics board between socket
1/20 and IC 6/12 15 replaced by the A7 wire connected to the
socket side and the Graphics Enable connection made to the IC 6
side, CA? to IC 17/19, GE not connected. Als 0 connect IC 17/18
to IC 20/12] (A7 ta IC 67/19 side of LSW 2/9 and GE to IC 66/18
side). The Graphics ciock is connected to the wire link to the
side of IC 4/11 CIC 17/111 (IC 67/11). With the Econographics
board fitted, the Veroboard can be mounted on to it, but if not
then a wire wrap sacket could be used to plug into the PIO
socket instead of Using ribbon cable and a DIL header.

After connecting the board to your Nascom, the display will
be black on white as, all the inputs are held high by the
pull-up resistors but as yet, the Port will nat be controlling
To initiate the Port, type 0 6 F and the screen will go blank as
the output of the Port is zero. lype 0 4 F and the display will
return but now under Port control. Ta change the display under
program control, send the appropriate value to the Port.

2 low blanks the display
3 lew disables the Graphics ROM
