In the first <a href="../text/"></a>issue of Micropower (you did get your copy of
the first <a href="../text/"></a>issue??<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>&ndash;Ed), Snowdinger, a circuit to effectively stop
on-screen disturbances caused by indiscriminate processor access
of the VDU RAM, was published. The circuit had one major
disadvantage, it was for a Nascom&nbsp;1 and my own computer is a
Nascom&nbsp;2. Hence after reading the article, the project was
forgotten. Now having just finished my exams at college, I was
looking for something to usefully occupy my time with. Since
mowing the lawn was completely out of the question, I decided to
look at the problem of converting Snowdinger into Snowdinger 2.
This article is the result of some two and a half days solid
work.

For those who either didn&rsquo;t get the first <a href="../text/"></a>Micropower or have
forgotten the theory behind Snowdinger, the basic approach is as
follows:
</p>
<p>
Each line of the TV picture is 64 microseconds long and in every
64 microseconds, 16 are blanked (line blanking), thus if 64
characters are used for one display line, each will take up a
time slot of 1 microsecond, Also 16 of the 64 will be lost due
to the line blanking, leaving 48 characters to be displayed
fully. Hence Nascom screens are 48 characters wide. For every
character on a TV line there are 8 possible dots to be
displayed, because each character cell is an 8x16 dot matrix, 16
TV lines are required to produce one row of 48 complete
character cells. The VDU circuitry places an eight bit byte of
data in the serialiser once per microsecond, where upon it is
sent to the TV one bit at a time. When it is empty the next byte
of data is loaded and the process goes on repeatedly for all 256
lines of the TV picture. If this period of 1 microsecond is
split into two seperate halves, one half may be used to send the
necessary data to the serialiser and the other half may be used
by the Z80 to access the VDU RAM. Using hardware to synchronise
the processor to these time slots of 500ns, no screen
disturbance will occur.

The theory sounds simple enough, putting it into practice is
however a little harder. The first thing that I noticed about
Snowdingers circuit was that it required slight changes to work
at 4&nbsp;Mhz. If this could be avoided in Snowdinger 2, then the
switches on the Nascom&nbsp;2 could be used as normal. By drawing out
all the clock waveforms on graph paper and looking in the Z80
technical manual at the timing for the read and write cycles, I
soon discovered why Snowdinger needed circuit changes to work at
4&nbsp;Mhz. Wait states are sampled on the falling edge of the 2nd
clock period (T2) of both the read and the write cycle. Since
there are twice as many falling edges in 4Mhz. a 500ns time slot
has within it, two falling edges of the 4&nbsp;Mhz clock, compared to
one falling edge of the 2&nbsp;Mhz clock. When no wait state is
found, the following negetive edge of the clock terminates the
cycle (whether read or write). In the case of the 2&nbsp;Mhz clock
this coincides with the access time slot, but for 4&nbsp;Mhz the read
or write cycle will be terminated before the access time slot
occurs (see diagrams for details of the waveforms).
