The SAVE command is used to transfer a program or data from
the computers memory to disc. This command has to be told how
much of the memory you want 1t to save, in 256 byte pages. The
area saved starts at 0100H, and a typical example of the command
is SAVE 5S SPLAT.COM which would copy the section of RAM from
0100H to OSFFH onto the disc and give it the f1le name SPLAT.COM
in the directory.

The final built-in command is TYPE which types out a file.
It will put it on the screen and 1* CP/M has been tald that the
printer 15 on, it will send it there as well.
</p>
<p>
So, how do we tell the system to send its output ta the
printeru This is acomplished using one of the Control key
commands mentioned earlier, Control P. There are several of
these commands besides Control P. Control C will {usually
reboot the system, Control H works like the backspace key
Control M15 the same as the enter key and Control E&para; stops and
starts the console display so that you can read all of the
directory, for example, when 1t would otherwise be scrolled off
screen. All these commands are covered in the two introductory
books that I suggest new CP/M users buy, in great detail. The
books are &ldquo;The CP/M Handbook&rdquo; by Rodney Zaks and &ldquo;Using CP/M&rdquo; by
Judi Fernandez and Ruth Ashley. Of the two, I prefer the first
but this a matter of taste. If you like the kind of book where
you are expected to fill in the answers to the questions as you
</p>
<p>
go along, then the latter book is excellent too. What neither
of them tells you, much to my disappointment, 15 how the machine
code addict can make use of CP/M in his programs. The
</p>
<p>
information is in the CP/M documentation. Sadly, it is terse in
the extreme and does not make several important points at all
clearly. In future articles I hope to give an insight into the
ways in which the routines in CP/M can be used by your
programs.
</p>
<p>
The description of CP/M that I have given so far does not
</p>
<p>
make any mention of how to run a program. It could not be
simpler, as all you do is type the name of the program and press
the enter key. The system checks what you have typed and if it
</p>
<p>
is not a built-in command, it looks on the disc for a file of
that name with a&nbsp;.COM extension. Suppose you type INVADERS and
press enter; there 15 no built-in command with this name, so
CP/M looks on the disc for a file called INVADERS.COM. If it
finds it, 1t loads the file into memory at address 0100H onwards
and jumps to the start of it. @ program of the kind described
is called a transient program because it is not in memory al
the time. Several transient programs are supplied with CP/M
when you buy it, all intended to make the system easier to use.
The transient programs supplied with the Gemini implementation
of CP/M that I use, and doubtless supplied with all the other
implementations of the system are as follows
</p>
<p>
ASM..COM This is an asembler, more of which later.
DDT.COM This is a debugging aid also mentioned later.
DUMP.COM A program for tabulating files in hex.
ERASIC.COM A compiler for BASIC, not without Limitations,
</p>
<p>
as it does not support POKE and PEEK commands.
Quite good file handling though.
</p>
<p>
ED.COM @ text file editor I shall malign later
</p>
<p>
ERUN. COM The run-time part of the BASIC compiler
