Now you HAVE to get down to reading the manual (several
times) and 1t is as well to make a copy of the master disc, just
in case of accidents!
</p>
<p>
First, you have to FORMAT an empty disc. This quite simple,
Enter &ldquo;FORMAT&rdquo;, hit enter and follow the instructions as they
are displayed. Put the master disc back, enter &ldquo;BACKUP&rdquo;, hit
Enter and again follow the instructions. I then started entering
my machine code files. They went in fine. The speed with which
they come out is amazing. &ldquo;Space Invaders&rdquo; loads in about 2
seconds flat.
</p>
<p>
However. now my troubles starts, PolyDos supports a very
useful disc basic system but when I tried to use it by entering
&ldquo;RASH I got a series of &ldquo;error"s flashing and nothing else.
So, once again to the dealer who now said that I needed 48K 0:
Ram and not the 32 which I had. Nothing for it but to shell out
for anew RAM baard with @ new 4116s and add the 16 41165 I
already had. (One 32k RAM board going begging but without the
411es &ndash; however. I might incorporate it later)
</p>
<p>
Well, at last with the new RAM board installed (I didn&rsquo;t
even do the memory test) it all worked. PolyDos Disc Basic came
up with &ldquo;38851 bytes free&rdquo;. My BASIC programs could now be
entered and run, Much more important for me were the commands to
set up Sequential and Random files, but here the manual failed
me somewhat
</p>
<p>
For a fandom Access File, it gives an example of a format
descriptor string &ndash; &ldquo;IS"+CHR$(36)+"S"4+CHR$ (48) &ndash; indicating that
each record consists of an integer and 2 strings of maximum
length 32 and 48. As this occupies more than one line, how can
ene enter it or get it to scroll over? I hope some one will tel
me it is just too simple and show me how to do it.
</p>
<p>
My other problem was with POLYZAP &ndash; the assembler program.
Here you have to enter a &ldquo;Source File Specifier&rdquo; but the manual
doesn&rsquo;t tell you (or, at least, I couldn&rsquo;t find it) now to
start. However, the answer ist&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Start with a file name eg. TEST.1X
</p>
<p>
Enter EDIT TEST.TX to which the monitor responds &ldquo;Press space
</p>
<p>
to continue&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
When you do this, the screen clears and a flashing cursor
</p>
<p>
appears in the top left hand corner
</p>
<p>
Enter your program in nmemonics to be assembled, editting 1t
</p>
<p>
as you go along
</p>
<p>
You can then assemble it by entering PZAP TEST.1X
Now, if all is well, (and it generally isn&rsquo;t) &ldquo;&ldquo;PZAP&rdquo; wil
assemble the program and output the results to the screen or the
printer. If, as generally happens, there are errors, 1t will
teil you what they are and you can start again. Now, I may nat
be doing 1t correctly and 1t has certainly caused me a lot of
hassle, but, I am told, it 15 a very powerful assembler and you
can throw away your ZEAP.
</p>
<p>
All im all I am really very pleased with PalyDos. It has
tremendous potential and really makes the Nascom a production
machine. I should be very interested to hear from any other
Nascom user who has experimented with it.
