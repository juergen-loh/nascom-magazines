The possibility of having 2 megabytes of RAN hung onto @
Nascom 21s remarkable but with the new 256K RAM boards. from
M\A.P.-G0 Systems this becomes a reality. You will require a
Large motherboard of some desciption with at least 9 slots (8
forthe RAM cards and 1 for the Nascom main board). but
suprisingly little money.
</p>
<p>
When I was first contacted about reviewing this new board I
imagined that it would be more a cane af the RAN controlling the
Nascom but T was pleasantly suprised ta find that tha 256K&rdquo; RAP
cards were a convenient @ y 8 with nothing more than 4 banks of
SAK RAM chips and some decode and paging circuitry. I had been
expecting at least an additional processor but, unless it wa
Ghaguised as a 74LS ceries chip, there definitely wasn&rsquo;t one.
</p>
<p>
ALL products have a distinguishing feature ef some kind or
other and this board is no exception. Its blue. None of your
Common or garden green or grey but blue, (The writing paper that
they sent ae was blue as walls?
</p>
<p>
i was sent, or rather had delivered, the prototype of the
board included in a Gemini disc system but I was also shown the
card working in a Naccom (my own Nascom in fact). The Gemini
System consisted of a processor card, video card, FDC and. the
Phar RAM card. I was also loaned 2 dise drives so that I could

tee the card under the control of CP/M.

<p>
fis L said earlier, the RAM is arranged in four 64K blocks
made up of 4864 chips. The minimum configuration is the beard
Populated to only 6a but it ts a simple matter of adding the
Gdditional RAM to make the board up to 256k but as the chips are
quite pricey upgrading should be done carefully.

<p>
As the Z80 is only capable of directly addressing 64K paging
ust be used te allow access to the RAN. Its not much use having
2iteg. if you can not use it. The page allocation is done using
2 link blocks which select which 44k block 18 on which page. The
Page control is performed via port FE mhich leaves port FF fre
for use by other carde eg. RAN B card. The normal Nascom paging
system only allows 4 pages but the 256k card gives a five Dit
decode which gives the user 32 &lsquo;pages&rsquo; te play with which works
out at 2 Megabytes. The RAM card works with most Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini
FOM/RAM cards but, unfortunately, your faithful RAM&nbsp;A cards ace
Incompatible though I would maging that if a bit of paging
could be added to then they could be reprieved. If you mane 80
tise your 6802 board in the system in the 32k paged mode you need
ko Goa mnor hardware mod but nathing difficult or
complicated.

The bits on port FE are assigned as follows:
