2 Megabyte Nascom

The possibility of having 2 megabytes of RAM hung onto a
Nascom&nbsp;2 is remarkable but with the new 256K RAM boards from
M.A.P.-80 Systems this becomes a reality. You will require a
large motherboard of some desciption with at least 9 slots (8
for the RAM cards and 1 for the Nascom main board) but
suprisingly little money.
</p>
<p>
When I was first contacted about reviewing this new board I
imagined that it would be more a case of the RAM controlling the
Nascom but I was pleasantly suprised to find that the 256K RAM
cards were a convenient 8 x 8 with nothing more than 4 banks of
64K RAM chips and some decode and paging circuitry. I had been
expecting at least an additional processor but, unless it was
disguised as a 74LS series chip, there definitely wasn&rsquo;t one.
</p>
<p>
All products have a distinguishing feature of some kind or
other and this board is no exception. Its blue. None of your
common or garden green or grey but blue. (The writing paper that
they sent me was blue as well.)
</p>
<p>
I was sent, or rather had delivered, the prototype of the
board included in a Gemini disc system but I was also shown the
card working in a Nascom (my own Nascom in fact). The Gemini
system consisted of a processor card, video card, FDC and the
256K RAM card. I was also loaned 2 disc drives so that I could
see the card under the control of CP/M.
</p>
<p>
As I said earlier, the RAM is arranged in four 64K blocks
made up of 4864 chips. The minimum configuration is the board
populated to only 64K but it ts a simple matter of adding the
additional RAM to make the board up to 256k but as the chips are
quite pricey upgrading should be done carefully.
</p>
<p>
As the Z80 is only capable of directly addressing 64K paging
must be used to allow access to the RAM. Its not much use having
2 Meg. if you can not use it. The page allocation is done using
2 link blocks which select which 64k block is on which page. The
page control is performed via port FE which leaves port FF free
for use by other cards eg. RAM&nbsp;B card. The normal Nascom paging
system only allows 4 pages but the 256k card gives a five bit
decode which gives the user 32 &lsquo;pages&rsquo; to play with which works
out at 2 Megabytes. The RAM card works with most Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini
ROM/RAM cards but, unfortunately, your faithful RAM&nbsp;A cards are
incompatible though I would imagine that if a bit of paging
could be added to then they could be reprieved. If you want to
use your G802 board in the system in the 32k paged mode you need
to do a minor hardware mod but nothing difficult or
complicated.

The bits on port FE are assigned as follows:
