For my own purposes, I do not so much require programs to be
stored as data. In particular, for one application where I want
to use big letters on the screen, I plan to place a <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> version
of the Nascom Character Generator into the spare 4K block and
use that in place of the conventional DATA statements that take
up an immense amount of storage in BASIC programs to perform
this function. I will probably at the same time replace some of
the less imaginative graphics, such as the teletext pixel
patterns, with a set of subroutines that can be called from
BASIC of Assembler programs.

One of the last worries that you may have is that your neat,
flexible Nascom is getting ROM bound. There is absolutely no
reason why this should happen, as long as you do not want to
keep changing from one ROM program to another without switching
off.
</p>
<p>
The full 48k of RAM can easily be accomodated alongside 26K
of ROM and EPROM that will fit on the Dual Monitor board and the
2K of RAM on the Nascom&nbsp;1 board. It cannot, however, be
accomodated at the same time and, therefore, a simple switch is
neede to disable either the RAM or the ROM. This is simply made
with a few TTL chips and installed after the decode block to
route the signal to either the RAM or ROM. What normally happens
is that the ROM is initially enabled until a signal is sent to
switch permanently to the RAM. This in called a <span class="uppercase">Phantom</span> line and
is a common signal in S-100 systems. It can either be a decoded
port signal or one of the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> lines, in which case it can be
used to toggle the selected chips and possibly alter the
addresses&nbsp;&ndash; with a bit of logic.
</p>
<p>
Unless you are content to enable the RAMs once and for all,
you should check whether the disabled RAMs are refreshed, if you
want to use their contents again anyway.

It is about here that the project gets passed back to you,
since my own ideas are getting out of the mainstream of
computing and into the specific areas of my interests. If you
want to find out about light-pens, Teletext interfaces,
piano-keyboards and embroidery designs, then each of these can
make up a whale article&hellip;<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>another time though.

I hope that the above has been of use to you if your Nascom&nbsp;1
was beginning to feel a little restricted and you thought the
only way out was a Sinclair. For the price of a Spectrum, you
can implement most of the above starting from a standard Nascom&nbsp;1
and that will just be the start of a male new lease of life.
