3) Nasprint Multiple Copies
</p>
<p>
This note came from fr. S, Stubbs of Inverurie,
Aberdeenshire.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Qne of the more obvious ommissions in Naspen is the ability
to print multiple copies of the same thing, without having to
press &lsquo;P&rsquo; every time. I produce about 100 copies of a 5000
Word club newsletter every month so I use the following piece
GF relocateable code which holds in B the number (in hex) of
copies required and calls the print routine in Naspen through
2 loop. The code can go anywhere except in Naspen workspace. I
Use OCB0 hex.
</p>
<p>
oceo 08 3A LD B,&pound;3A_ 758 copies wanted

oces | 10 FB DINZ &pound;0C82 ;Loop back 5B times
oca7 C3 04 88 JP 8RE06 cReturn to Naspen
</p>
<p>
To use, just enter this code having set the secona byte for
the number of copies in hex (up to 255 of FF hex) and execute
at the address loaded. Eneure that when you exit from Naspen
you leave the cursor pointing at the first character to be
Printed or use the &ldquo;2&rdquo; command before leaving if you want the
thale text file printing. Ax the loop executes, you mill see.
Scompleted&rdquo; printed on the screen after every copy. This
because it is within the print routine in Naspen and before
the RETurn command.
