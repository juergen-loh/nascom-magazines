Nasprint Multiple Copies<br>
<p>
This note came from Mr. S. Stubbs of Inverurie,
Aberdeenshire.
</p>
<p>
One of the more obvious ommissions in Naspen is the ability
to print multiple copies of the same thing, without having to
press &lsquo;P&rsquo; every time. I produce about 100 copies of a 3000
Word club newsletter every month so I use the following piece
of relocateable code which holds in B the number (in hex) of
copies required and calls the print routine in Naspen through
a loop. The code can go anywhere except in Naspen workspace. I
use 0C80 hex.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-32-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
To use, just enter this code having set the second byte for
the number of copies in hex (up to 255 of FF hex) and execute
at the address loaded. Ensure that when you exit from Naspen
you leave the cursor pointing at the first character to be
printed or use the &lsquo;Z&rsquo; command before leaving if you want the
whole text file printing. As the loop executes, you will see
&lsquo;completed&rsquo; printed on the screen after every copy. This
because it is within the print routine in Naspen and before
the RETurn command.

Modifying the Nascom&nbsp;2 for 2732 EPROMs Amendment<br>
<p>
Mr. A. Want spotted this
<a href="../../../22/02/text/#article1">error in a drawing</a>
in Volume 2,
Number 2 in the <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> EPROM article. D2 going into the 74LS175
has been assigned to pin 12 in the diagram but should be
assigned to pin 13 to work.
