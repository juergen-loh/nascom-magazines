Labels for Xtal BASIC

This article describes how labels can be added to Xtal
BASIC. These labels can be used instead of line numbers in such
commands as GOSUB and GOTO. This helps in producing easy to read
programs, and allows subroutines to be referenced by meaningful
names. Subroutines and other sections of a program can be moved
around without the chore of searching the complete program to
find any subroutine calls, or other references. It is surprising
how such a relatively simple extension to BASIC improves the
readability and ease of modification of the code.
</p>
<p>
The basic (no pun intended) idea is to first change the
BASIC interpreter so that it will ignore a label on a line, and
then alter the routines for GOSUB, GOTO etc. so that they will
work with line numbers or labels. The first thing to do is to
find a suitable format for the labels. I finally settled on a
string of alphanumeric characters which starts and ends with a
single quote mark. The quote marks make it relatively simple to
distinguish between a label and a line number or anything else,
in, for example, an IF..THEN statement.<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>This will minimise the
increase in execution time for the interpreter.
</p>
<p>
Next, a suitable point to patch the program. There is a
section of code in Xtal which is used every time a statement
finishes. This code checks for a keyword, a variable or a line
terminator and executes the appropriate routine. Since all
keywords are greater than 80H, any character less than this at
the beginning of a line is assumed to be part of a variable
name. Any illegal names for variables are detected later in the
LET routine. Here I diverted the code to check for a single
quote. If one is found, then my routine skips aver any
characters between this and the next. Note that this particular
patch allows a label anywhere on a line at the end of
statement. Although labels will only be used if they occur at
the beginning of a line, this allows comments to be embedded in
a line, as long as they are enclosed in single quotes. A missing
second quote gives a syntax error. Otherwise, the routine simply
treats anything after the end of the label as the start of a new
statement.
</p>
<p>
Finally, altering the GOTO and GOSUB statements. Here I
again patched the original code in the interpreter. GOTO, GOSUB
and RUN all use the same code to jump to a line number. The
subroutine call to get the line number is changed so that it
checks the first character after the keyword. If it is a quote,
then it is assumed to be the start of a label. If not, something
which is dealt with by the original routine. (This allows labels
to be used with more complex types of statement, such as an IF
statement, where almost anything is legal after the THEN
