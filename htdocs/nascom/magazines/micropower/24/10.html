itself whenever the computer is on. The battery-backup takes
over whenever the computer is switched off and the board can be
removed, the page links reorganised, etc, etc. A very useful
facility.

This is provided for Nascom users who have not got the
Nas-IO signal decoded anywhere else in their system. This
provides all the decoding necessary for port FFhex.

All the link connections made on the board are done so using
pieces of wire pushed into gold plated socket pins. Once you
have decided how you ant your system configuring it is an easy
matter (though fiddly at times) to cut the wire to appropriate
lengths and link the pads. It is purely a matter of pulling out
the appropriate links again in link blocks A, B and/or C to
reconfigure the memory map, page layout and page-on-reset. As
long as link block D connections, the power options, are not
changed, the memory contents remain unchanged. I have carried
the board around and left it unplugged for a couple of days
without any corrupted data at all. The only thing that you have
to be careful with is NOT placing the board on a conductive
surface as this can short out the power lines and so cause the
odd problem.

The possible uses for the board are endless. One application
would be to use a page in Read only made to develope or modify
another monitor system. I have used the board as two 16K pages,
one of which contains Wordease and some printer driver routines
and the other page purely as normal RAM. It means that I can
switch on my machine on a morning, flip a port and then leap
enthusiastically into my latest Wordease file without having to
reload anything from tape. Easier to use than disc (and faster,
and cheaper? and far more versatile than EPROMS.
</p>
<p>
The board runs at 4Mhz without wait states and if a
partially populated board is purchased, any <?php externalLink("6116"); ?> chips can be
used as long as they do not draw more than 100 micro&nbsp;Amps each.
Alternatively NMOS RAMs and EPROM can be put on the board but
not connected into the battery-backed circuit.
</p>
<p>
In summary then, this is an excellent 8 by 8 board which is
a viable alternative to an EPROM card as an. EPROM
programmer/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>eraser are unnecessary. It is easy to set up, very
versatile and simple to use. A simple routine could easily be
written to provide a menu driven system to select between the
different pages and so utilities/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>monitors/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>programs.

Finally, many thanks to Mr. L. Opit of microcode for
providing me with the board to review and helpfully answering
all my questions.
