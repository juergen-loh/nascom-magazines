How to convert the popular Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Bits and PCs EPROM Programmer
to program <?php externalLink("2732","",""); ?>s and <?php externalLink("2716","",""); ?>s instead of <?php externalLink("2708","",""); ?>s and 2716s, at a cost
of two 1M resistors.

That excellent article by D. A. Boyd
(<a href="../../../22/02/text/#article1">Micropower, Volume 2, Number 2</a>)
showing how to put 32K of EPROM on a Nascom&nbsp;2 board
was exactly what I needed for our school Nascom&nbsp;2s. Trouble is
that our Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Bits and PCs EPROM programmer only blows 2708s
and 2716s, or does it? This article explains how to convert this
very popular &lsquo;blower&rsquo; into a 2716/2732 model. The same warning
applies as in D. A. Boyd&rsquo;s article, it will not work with 2532s,
although making it do so would be easier than it was for the
2732. I chose the more difficult route because the 2732 is now
available at just over &pound;4 for the 350&nbsp;nsec version. Having had
timing problems with 2708s, I thought the extra 50-100&nbsp;nsecs
needed by the 2532 might be critical. (It shouldn&rsquo;t be I know).
</p>
<p>
The 2732 is programmed by:
</p>
<ol class="paranthesis indent justify">
<li>
Placing 25 volts, steady, on pin 18, known as /0E Vpp.
</li>
<li>
Putting the right address on the 12 address pine A0 to
a11.<br>
Putting the eight bits of the required data on the eight
data pins D0 to D7.
</li>
<li>
When all the above are stable, drop pin 20, know as /CE,
to 0 volts for 50 milli-secs from its standby voltage of 5
volts.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Thanks to the superb documentation with the Gemini<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>/Bits and
PCs blower, I realised that this was very easily arranged. (Yes,
I did say &lsquo;superb documentation&rsquo;.) Mind you, it took a week of
evenings to sort out, but then I am not an electrical engineer
or a programmer.

Hardware Modifications.

<p>
Please do not write in saying how hamfisted these are, it is
easy and it works. First study the switch diagram in Figure 1,
the IC pin out diagram in Figure 2 and the voltage/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>pin out in
Figure 3. Do this in conjunction with the circuit diagrams
supplied with the board. Note that the pins of switch 2 are
labelled as if it were an IC, orientated like the other ICs on
the board. Now, work as follows...
</p>
<ol class="paranthesis indent justify">
<li>
On the top of the board, cut the two thick tracks between
the two switches close to switch 2. On the underside of
the board, close to switch 2, cut two thin tracks, one
going to pin 6 of the switch (the furthest from the edge
of the board) and the other to pin 3 (the track that
crosses the switch). All four 2708 switch pins are now
&lsquo;floating&rsquo; and ready to become 2732 pins.
</li>
</ol>
