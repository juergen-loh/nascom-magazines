How ta convert the popular Gemini /Bits and PCs EPROM Programmer
to program 2752s and 2716s instead of 2708s and 2716s, at a cost
of ta IM resistors.
</p>

That excellent article by D. A. Boyd (Micropower, Volume 2,
Number 2) showing how to put S2K of EPROM on a Nascom&nbsp;2 board
was exactly what I needed for our school Nascom 26. Trouble is
that our Gemini/Bits and PCs EPROM programmer only blows 27086
and 2716s, or does it? This article explains how to convert thie
Very popular &lsquo;blower&rsquo; into a 2716/2732 @odel. The sase warning
applies as in D. A. Boyd&rsquo;s article, it will fot work with 2532s,
although making it do so would be easier than it was for the
2752. I chose the more difficult route because the 2732 is now
available at just over &pound;4 for the 350 nsec version. Having had
timing problems with 2708s, 1 thought the extra 50-100. neecs
needed by the 2552 might be critical. (It shouldn&rsquo;t be T know).
</p>
<p>
The 2732 is programmed by:
</p>
<p>
1) Placing 25 volts, steady, on pin 18, known as /0E Vp.
</p>
<p>
2) Putting the right address on the 12&rsquo; address pine A0 to
an.
Putting the eight bits of the required data on the eight
dats pins Do to D7.
</p>
<p>
4) When all the above are stable, drop pin 20, know as /CE,
to 0 volts for 50 milli-secs from its standby voltage of 5
</p>

Thanks ta the superb documentation with the Gemini /Bits and
PCs blower, I realised that this was very easily arranged. (Yes,
T did cay &lsquo;superb documentation&rsquo;.) Mind you, it took a week of
evenings to sort out, but then Iam not an. electrical engineer
or a programmer &ndash;

Please do not write in saying how hamfisted these are, it is
easy and it works. First study the switch diagram in Figure ty
the IC pin out diagram in Figure 2 and the voltage/pin out in
Figure 3. Da this in conjunction with the circuit diagrams
supplied with the board. Note that the pins of switch 2&rdquo; are
Tabelled as 1f it were an IC, orientated like the other ICs on
the board, Now, work as follows.--
</p>
<p>
1) On the top of the board, cut the two thick tracks between
the two switches close to switch 2. On the underside of
the board, close to suite 2, cut two thin tracks, one
going to pin &amp; of the switch (the furthest from the edge
of the beard) and the other to pin 3 (the track that
crosses the switch). All four 2708 switch pins are now
&ldquo;floating&rdquo; and ready te become 2752 pins.
