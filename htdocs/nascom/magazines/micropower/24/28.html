2) Short out the pulse capacitor, C10, from the old 2708 25
volt pulse circuit showy on sheet 3 of the circuit
Giagrams. Take a lead from &lsquo;A&rdquo; of that diagram (I used the
end of RS furthest from TR2) to pio Sof switch 2. This
Will provide 25 volts on pin 20 of the recipient EPROM.

BS Lift IC&nbsp;2. Bend out pins 7 and 14. Use one of your two 1
Meg resistors to pull pin 7 down to 0 volts by connecting
it between pin 7 and the mide track close to pin 7. Pin 7
must also be connected to Bit 6 of port S. This is easiest
done by using the through-plated hole next to the C7
legend. Pin 14 im left unconnected. Bit &amp; of port 5 now
controls a 25 volt/O volt output to pin 20 of the
recipient EPROM.

<p>
9) Connect together pins @ and 9 ef swotch 2 to put ALO on
pin 19 of both EPROM.
</p>
<p>
5) Fortunately, IC % produces an All signal on pin 1. I bent
pin 1 of IC&rsquo;S out and connected it ta pin I! of the same
Sitch to provide All on pin 21 of bath the doner and
recipient EPROMs.
</p>
<p>
4) Join Bit 2 of port 5 to pin &amp; of switch 2. This 1m beat
achieved by using the plated hole just by the TR6 Legend
and close to the switch. I also pulled pin &amp; of the switch
toS volts with the second 1 Meg resistor. I used&rdquo; the
Legend end of R20 for ay 5 volts,

Your board is now a 2752 programmer when switch 2 12 pushed
in and a 2716 programmer when switch 2 is out, but on?y shen the
software is correct.

am most grateful. First, the functions of the bits 0 to 6 of the
control word that is used to control the EPROM blower.
