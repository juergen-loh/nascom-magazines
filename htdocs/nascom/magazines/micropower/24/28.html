Short out the pulse capacitor, C10, from the old 2708 25&nbsp;volt
pulse circuit showy on sheet 3 of the circuit
diagrams. Take a lead from &lsquo;A&rdquo; of that diagram (I used the
end of R5 furthest from TR2) to pin 3 of switch 2. This
will provide 25 volts on pin 20 of the recipient EPROM.
</li>
<li>
Lift IC&nbsp;2. Bend out pins 7 and 14. Use one of your two 1&nbsp;Meg
resistors to pull pin 7 down to 0 volts by connecting
it between pin 7 and the wide track close to pin 7. Pin 7
must also be connected to Bit 6 of port 5. This is easiest
done by using the through-plated hole next to the C7
legend. Pin 14 is left unconnected. Bit 6 of port 5 now
controls a 25&nbsp;volt/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>0&nbsp;volt output to pin 20 of the
recipient EPROM.
</li>
<li>
Connect together pins 8 and 9 of switch 2 to put A10 on
pin 19 of both EPROM.
</li>
<li>
Fortunately, IC&nbsp;3 produces an All signal on pin 1. I bent
pin 1 of IC&rsquo;3 out and connected it to pin 11 of the same
switch to provide All on pin 21 of both the donor and
recipient EPROMs.
</li>
<li>
Join Bit 2 of port 5 to pin 6 of switch 2. This is best
achieved by using the plated hole just by the TR6 legend
and close to the switch. I also pulled pin 6 of the switch
to 5 volts with the second 1 Meg resistor. I used the
legend end of R20 for my 5 volts.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Your board is now a 2752 programmer when switch 2 is pushed
in and a 2716 programmer when switch 2 is out, but only when the
software is correct.

Thank you Bits and PCs for your fully documented listing. I
am most grateful. First, the functions of the bits 0 to 6 of the
control word that is used to control the EPROM blower.
