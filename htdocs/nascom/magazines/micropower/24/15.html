Latter day ROMs work off 5&nbsp;volts and take relatively little
juice from bus lines, particularly as they have standby modes
when not enabled. So, out with the hacksaw and dawn to work.
</p>
<p>
The first job is to remove the switches from the Monitor
board and you will also need to remake the links to pin 20
(Output Enable) on the two sockets that are plugged through into
the Nascom&nbsp;1.
</p>
<p>
Next you need to cut the tracks to pin 19 and 21 of the
other pair of sockets. These carry the +12 and &minus;5&nbsp;volts needed
by <?php externalLink("2708","",""); ?>s but not by <?php externalLink("2716","",""); ?>s nor bigger ROMs.
</p>
<p>
The 2708 sockets provide all the data bus lines and address
lines A0 ta A9. To accomodate a 2716, you need ta find A10 and
connect it to pin 19. A <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> needs A11 and that has to go to pin
18, and the BASIC ROM needs A12 on pin 21. Check with a data
sheet, or any of the many articles on the subject more competent
than this one, as to what to do with the pins that are now
floating, but you can in practice pick up A10, A11 and A12 from
anywhere on the Nascom&nbsp;1. Suggested places in increasing order
of &lsquo;safety&rsquo; are the Z80 CPU Socket (pins 40, 1 and 2), the
Nascom&nbsp;1 bus/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>43-way connector (pins 14, 13 and 9) and lastly the
Nas/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>80-bus connectors on the buffered. motherboard (pins
40,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>41 and 42). These are also in increasing order of length, so
a final decision must be made as a compromise between physical
and electrical properties.
</p>
<p>
The last part of the modification depends on the RAM board
that is fitted to the system and produces the correct enable
lines for the ROMs. I use the Nascom
<?php externalLink("RAM&nbsp;B"); ?>
card which has the
Nascom&nbsp;1 connection on the bank-select socket. Sixteen
open-collector outputs are used to choose which part of each
bank of RAM is mapped to which 4K memory area. The simplest
solution and the one that I tried first, was to connect pin 20
of the BASIC ROM to the E and F outputs of the bank-select. No
surgery is required since there is a convenient hole where the
switch was taken out of the board.
</p>
<p>
So, the N1 select goes to block 0, the 16K of RAM goes from
1000H to 4FFFH and the BASIC ROM resides from E000H to FFFFH.
Nas-sys in the 2708 sockets and switch on.
</p>
<p>
The first task was to test the RAM and that produced no
problems at all. Nas-sys appeared to work through all its many
features and, very happily, when the area of memory from E000H
upwards is tabulated, we can see that BASIC is there. Give it a
&lsquo;J&rsquo; and it crashes.
</p>
<p>
Wait states&hellip;?? Yes, I have heard of them, but this is not
meant to be a technical article. Is the ROM fast enough to work?
Can the Z80 read it at 2MHz? It obviously is because it can be
tabulated and you can even do a fast copy of its contents into a
Ram area with the &lsquo;C&rsquo; command but the &lsquo;J&rsquo; still does not work.
