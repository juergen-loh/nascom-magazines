Hore are two more &lsquo;pretty picture&rsquo; plotting programe. the
first is from fir. D-P. Jackson of Harworth, Ne. Doncaster.

The second offering comes from Mr. Ned. Thomas of Kings Lynn

fir. Thomas also points out that anyone who has a Nascom #
and Econogeaphics will run inte probleme when trying to at the
Bhowdinger (1) circuit. They both try and sit over the same
Place. He suggests that Snowdinger be brought out on ribbon
Cable to hang beside the PIO.
</p>
<p>
Finally, can anyone tre up the PIO pin outs of the Nascom&nbsp;1
and 2/80 that the EPROM Programmer circuit can be built by
Nascom&nbsp;1 omers.

Besides articles for the magazine, these are the only two
letters that I have had since the last issue. I don&rsquo;t think that
you are really trying. @ nice feature to add to the magazine
Would be a permanent letters page in which we could set up a
Problem and answer series, Fire away.
