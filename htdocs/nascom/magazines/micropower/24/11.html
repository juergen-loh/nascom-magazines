A 64K EPROM Board for &pound;4&nbsp;?

My school hay three Languages for the Nascom, Nascom Pascal,
Forth and Nascom BASIC. We use a 6K assembler, a 4K
Disassembler/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>debug, a micro-cassette monitor and our own control
programs to make the use of these facilities as easy as
possible. We would like to add a word processor, printer
routines and perhaps Pilot. It looked as if in the end we would
require 2 EPROM boards per machine. Then Mr. D. A. Boyd wrote
his article on using 4K 2732 EPROMS. This would half solve our
problems so I converted our EPROM burner and fitted Mr. Boyd&rsquo;s
conversion. Fortunately it did not work. One pin was wrongly
labelled on the diagrams. I say fortunately because it meant I
had to work out how the circuit actually worked. In the process
I realised that it really is easy to double up and convert the
Nascom&nbsp;2 plus
<?php externalLink("RAM B","RAM&nbsp;B"); ?>
board into a 44K RAM and 64K EPROM machine.
It costs about &pound;4 to do the job and saves the expense of two
EPROM cards and two edge Connectors. The disadvantage is that
you only have 44k of RAM available on a standard Nascom&nbsp;2
whereas EPROM board owners gloat unceasingly over their 64k.

<p>
The principle depends on the 2732 having, in effect, two chip
select pins, /OE and /CE, pins 20 and 18. The Nascom&nbsp;2 selects
the 8 on-board memory sockets using the /CE signals generated by
IC&nbsp;46. Pins 3 and 13 of IC&nbsp;46 can be used as a binary input
giving 0 to 3 to select 4 banks of 2 sockets in the following
manner.

<p>
IC&nbsp;46 needs lows on pins 2 and 15 for this selection to
work, and link switch 1,8 set to 8K. The logic lows are provided
by the /XROM signal from the control board. Now is the time to
study the circuit diagram with this article with the Nascom
Memory circuit to hand

<p>
It should be sufficient to explain the three output signals.
in detail leaving space far a few extra comments at the end.

<table>
<tr><td>
1)</td><td>/XROM&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>When any address outside the EPROM block at C000-FFFF
is selected, gate 3, the &lsquo;AND&rsquo; gate, ensures that
/XROM is inactive high. RAM is not disabled and IC&nbsp;46
is not enabled for bank select. When an EPROM address
is selected, /XROM is active low, RAM at that address
is disabled while IC&nbsp;46 is enabled for both banks A
and B.
