My school hay three Languages for the Nascom, Naecom Pascal,
Forth&rdquo; and Nascom BASIC. We use a 6K assembler, a 4K
Dieasseabler/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>detug, a micro-cassette monitor and our own control
programs to make the use of these facilities as easy as
Possible. We would like fo adda word processor, printer
Foutines and perhaps Pilot. Tt looked az if in the end me would
require 2 EPROM boards per machine. Then He. D. A. Boyd wrote
his article on uring 4K 2732 EPROMS. This would half solve&rdquo; our
prablens so T converted our EPROM burner and fitted Mr. Boyd&rsquo;s
Converston. Fortunately 18 did nat work: One pin was wrongly
labelled on the diagrams. I say fortunately because it meant I
had to worl out how the circuit actually worked. In the process
T realised that it really i= easy to double up and convert the
Nascom&nbsp;2 plus RAM&nbsp;B board into # 44K RAM and 64K EPROM machine.
Tt coats about &pound;4 to do the job and saves&rdquo; the expense of two
EPROM cards and two edge Connectars. The disadvantage is that
you only have 44k of RAM available on a standard Nascom&nbsp;2
thereas EPROM board owns &copy; gloat unceasingly over their 64k.

<p>
The principle depends on the 2752 having, in effect, two chip
select pins, /Ob and /CE, pins 20 and 18. The Nascom&nbsp;2 selects
the @ on-board memory sockets using the /CE signals generated by
IC&nbsp;46. Pins + and 15 of IC&nbsp;44 can Be Weed asa binary. input
giving &copy; to 5 te select 4 banks of 2 sockets in the following

Te 42 needs lows on pins 2 and IS for this selection
works and Link switch I,8 set to BK, The logte lows are provided
By the /XROM signal from the control board. Now is the time to
Study the circuit diagram wth this article with the Nascom
Memory circuit to hand

<p>
Tt should be suffscrent to explain the three output signals.
tn detail leaving space far a few extra comments at the end-

1) /XROM ihe any address outside the EPROM block at C000-FFFF
is selected, gate 5, the &ldquo;AND&rdquo; gate, ensures that
/XROM is inactive high. RAM is not disabled and IC&nbsp;46
te not enabled for bank Select. When an EPROM address
f= selected, /XROM is active low, RAM at that address
is dimabled&rsquo;while IC&nbsp;4c is enabled for&rdquo; both banks A
and Be
