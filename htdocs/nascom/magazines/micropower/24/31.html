1) Snowdinger 2
Mr. Uilitame of Shoeburyness, Essex found the 2 deliberate
mistakes in the Snondinger 2 circuit diagram contained in. the
Tast isuue. The labelling on IC49 pins 2 and somehow got
reversed which means that pin 2 was really pin &amp; and pin 6 was
really pin 2. Also pin 1 of IC3 should have been connected to
pin &amp; of C49 (2MHz and not MHz as shown).
</p>
<p>
Me. Williams also points out that to run at 4NHz 2 2200hm
pull-up resistor is required on pin 9 of ICt.

<p>
Many thanks to Mr. Williams for pointing out these errors, its
nice to get letters even if they only tell ae that 1 made a
botchup of the previous issue.
