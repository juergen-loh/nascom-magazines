Snowdinger 2<br>
<p>
Mr. Wilitams of Shoeburyness, Essex found the 2 deliberate
mistakes in the
<a href="../../../23/08/text/#article1">Snowdinger 2</a>
circuit diagram contained in the
last issue. The labelling on IC49 pins 2 and 6 somehow got
reversed which means that pin 2 was really pin 6 and pin 6 was
really pin 2. Also pin 1 of IC3 should have been connected to
pin 6 of IC49 (2MHz and not 8MHz as shown).
</p>
<p>
Mr. Williams also points out that to run at 4MHz a 220ohm
pull-up resistor is required on pin 9 of IC1.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks to Mr. Williams for pointing out these errors, its
nice to get letters even if they only tell me that I made a
botchup of the previous issue.
