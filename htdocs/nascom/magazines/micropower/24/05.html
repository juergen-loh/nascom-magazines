8. RESTORE "LABEL" (see note above)
9. TR, .THEN "LABEL"
10. TF, .G0TO "LABEL"

The places to put the patches are detailed in the listing of
the machine code. I hope that these routines will help you next

<p>
tine that you have to debug a bigger and better version of STAR
TREK, or whatever. Anyways good luck!

Incidently, has anyone noticed a bug in Xtal? It surfaces
when you give a statement ke: IF A=1 GOTO X=2 which ie treated
by the interpreter as identical te IF A=1 THEN X=2, not asa
syntax error. If anybody haw naticed any other peculiarities of
Xtal, or even that revolting version of BASIC that was sold by
NASCOM, then a letter to the magazine might relieve a lot of
other people af some head-seratching-

My final comment. The I:sting given here is from an
assembler called 22. This ansembler is much faster than&rdquo; any
Gther available for NASCOM that I have seen. For instance, the
source code for a LISP interpreter which I have just finished
runs from 2550 to C2B0 hex. This takes approx. 45 seconds to
Ssseable, producing just under GK of code. I won&rsquo;t even mention
the speed of ZEAP an a simlar size file. If there is anyone
still out there who still markets this asseabler, then perhaps.
they will write in and give their address for those of Us who
work on reasonable sized programs.
