similar to that used on the RAM A board and is very straight

Once you have decided where you want your RAM (there&rsquo;s no
anawer to that) the next thing is to decide whether you want the
RAM as one 32K page or tno 16K pages and then which pages to use
(0 to 3). This t= the decoding carried out at LKSB. If you
choose to have tua 16K pages these are ausigned as page A and
page B and may be placed into the memory map on pages 0 to 3.
The explanation provided in the manual for this, decoding is.
probably the hardest part to follow. It is easy to configure
your board from the examples provided but the explanation i&reg; not
Very clear and it took a phone call to Microcode and a long hard
look at the circuit diagram before the theory emerged. The page
selection uses Port FFhex to feed a latch which is linked to the
buffered data bus. The low nibble of the byte provides the page
J enables and the high nibble, the page write enables.

Therefore, to put your RAM as Read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>lrite on pages 0 and 2,
connect 1D to bit 0, 2D te bit 4, 3D to bit 2 and 4D to bit 4:
This leaves the pages free for other page compatible RAN or
EPROM boards.

LINK BLOCK &copy; (LKSC) Page configuration &ndash; page reset option
</p>
<p>
This lank block is used to select which, if any, pages will
be paged in on reset (including power up). if page B ts required
on reset then link WEB and REB to any of the @ dash pads. Tt is
possible to have the selected page as Read only on reset in
Mhich case only the REB is connected to a @ dash pad. Hardwired
Write protect&rsquo; (and Read protect if necessary) can be
scromplished by wiring the appropriate WE and/or RE pads to the
Provided &copy; volt pads.

LINK BLOCK D (LKSD) Power option.

<p>
This is the beauty of the board. Up untsi now st can have
been regarded purely as 32K of paged RAM. The poner option
provides the battery-backed links required ta turn the RAN into
Something close to easily &ndash; programmable/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>eraseable/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>changeable
EPROM. Each chip in provided with a link option allowing it- te
be either connected ta the backup supply (provided by an
on-board VARTEC MEMPAK S.4v PCB Ni-cad. Battery) or connected
just to the normal +5v line of the micro. The battery can
Bupport the fully populated board for over 40 days and recharge
