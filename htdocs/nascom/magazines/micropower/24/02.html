Editorial
</h1>
<p>
1 wontier how many people actually read these words of wisdom
that are commoniy referred to as Editorials. 1 must admit that T
find them pretty heavy going in the glossy magazines. Well, the
point of those last tno Zines of dribble is that if you do nat
Fead the rest of this Editorial you will not know what has
happened to the front cover and what will be happening from the
next issue onmards.
</p>
<p>
T proudly announce that from the next issue onwards this
magazine will be known as the Nascom Newsfetter and will be
Completely restructured to include a section from Nascom
theaselves (or rather, the Nascom bit of Lucas Logic). 1. am
hoping to get news &lsquo;from the front&rsquo; from Nascom so that T should
be able to give you the latest developments, products from Lucas
and pomsibly a section of hardware and software hints from
then.
</p>
<p>
I also want to know what you want to see added to the
agazine, removed, changed, etc. This is supposed to ae your
Bagazine but I can not do much unless I get some feedback from
you. The aore articles and letters that come in, the better the
Balance in the make-up and the higher the standard of the
magazine in general. My current thoughts on the make-up of the
agazine are one third software, one third hardware and one
third letters, adverts, etc. This is the type of balance that 1
am aiaing for at present but I will willingly change tt on
demand.
</p>
<p>
Other suggestions for the magazine are a club page and a
witty corner (Corn Corner?). Also, it may be possible to set up
2 &lsquo;nanted&rdquo; section where readers can get together to. buy items
in bulk and possibly get some discount from the suppliers. Any
suppliers willing to make any offers?
</p>
<p>
The magazine fas not got enough funds to supply you all with
pens, envelopes and stamps to wite to me but Tam including
Sheet for you to f111 iny and memory plague te anyone who does
not reply. This should give me some indication af what you want
to see in the magazine which makes the editing easier.

In the next issue of the magazine, the first of the Nascom
Newsletters, we are hoping to run a competition. The details
have not been finalised yet but 1t will be ch-sponsored by Micra
Power (our owning company) and Microcode (Control) Led. with all
sorts of prizes and goodies to be won. This. should be enough
incentive to ensure that you will all buy the next magarin
</p>
<p>
Heri, that&rsquo;s it for another editorial, the last in the
Micropower series, next stop Nascom Newsletter. Many thanks to
the readers who have been contributing to Micropower, keep the
articles coming in, the more the merrier.
