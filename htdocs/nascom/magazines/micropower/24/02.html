Editorial
</h1>
<p>
I wonder how many people actually read these words of wisdom
that are commonly referred to as Editorials. I must admit that I
find them pretty heavy going in the glossy magazines. Well, the
point of those last two lines of dribble is that if you do not
read the rest of this Editorial you will not know what has
happened to the front cover and what will be happening from the
next <a href="../text/"></a>issue onwards.
</p>
<p>
I proudly announce that from the
<a href="../../../../nascom-newsletter/25/-1/text/#page">next issue</a>
onwards this magazine will be known as the
<a href="../../../../nascom-newsletter/text/">Nascom Newsletter</a> and will be
completely restructured to include a
<a href="../../../../nascom-newsletter/25/30/text/#article1">section from Nascom</a>
themselves (or rather, the Nascom bit of Lucas Logic). I am
hoping to get news &lsquo;from the front&rsquo; from Nascom so that I should
be able to give you the latest developments, products from Lucas
and possibly a section of hardware and software hints from
them.
</p>
<p>
I also want to know what you want to see added to the
magazine, removed, changed, etc. This is supposed to be your
magazine but I can not do much unless I get some feedback from
you. The more articles and letters that come in, the better the
balance in the make-up and the higher the standard of the
magazine in general. My current thoughts on the make-up of the
magazine are one third software, one third hardware and one
third letters, adverts, etc. This is the type of balance that I
am aiming for at present but I will willingly change it on
demand.
</p>
<p>
Other suggestions for the magazine are a club page and a
witty corner (Corn Corner?). Also, it may be possible to set up
a &lsquo;wanted&rsquo; section where readers can get together to buy items
in bulk and possibly get some discount from the suppliers. Any
suppliers willing to make any offers?
</p>
<p>
The magazine has not got enough funds to supply you all with
pens, envelopes and stamps to write to me but I am including
sheet for you to fill in, and memory plague to anyone who does
not reply. This should give me some indication of what you want
to see in the magazine which makes the editing easier.
</p>
<p>
In the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue of the magazine, the first of the Nascom
Newsletters, we are hoping to run a competition. The details
have not been finalised yet but it will be co-sponsored by Micro
Power (our owning company) and Microcode (Control) Ltd. with all
sorts of prizes and goodies to be won. This should be enough
incentive to ensure that you will all buy the next magazine.
</p>
<p>
Well, that&rsquo;s it for another editorial, the last in the
Micropower series, next stop Nascom Newsletter. Many thanks to
the readers who have been contributing to Micropower, keep the
articles coming in, the more the merrier.
