Making a Nascom&nbsp;1 into a Nascom&nbsp;2&nbsp;&ndash; so to speak

This application note is intended as a guide for any
soldering iron freak who happens to fall into the same way of
thinking as myself. I will not guarantee that what has been
accomplished on my system will work nor that it will not destroy
what you have scrimped and saved lovingly to build over the last
seven or eight years.
</p>
<p>
The Nascom&nbsp;1 is an excellent machine even without the
addition of Nas-sys, and a lot more powerful than many people
realise, but in the light of the Nascom&nbsp;2, it has somewhat
paled, although with the time and effort lost in the &lsquo;bankrupcy&rsquo;
period, the total system has somewhat paled in the light of what
you can now get for the same cost. In defence of the concept, I
must add that what you lose in getting a complete working system
from another source is more valuable to me than the money saved,
but then I am funny that way. You probably are too.
</p>
<p>
I acquired my Nascom&nbsp;1 many years ago and it served several
purposes before being consigned to its box to gather dust while
I set to work (paid) an a number of different systems. My work
eventually moved on to the Nascom&nbsp;2 as a base for an o.e.m.
learning system and interest in the Nascom&nbsp;1 was regenerated to
the extent of acquiring a buffer board and a 16K RAM card.
</p>
<p>
During my original researches with the Nascom&nbsp;1, I had
expanded to the extent of CCsoft Tiny BASIC which I fitted to
the standard machine using the Bits &amp; P.C.s dual monitor board
and I must commend this (if it is still available) to anyone who
wants a cheap training system for BASIC. But, although I wrote a
large number of useful programs (like calculating Pi to several
thousand places) with the unexpanded Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CCsoft system, the
prospect of having so much extra storage did not appeal to my
pioneering spirit, and I looked for a better vehicle to explore
the wide-open spaces.
</p>
<p>
The answer was abviously the ROM BASIC from the Nascom&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;
,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>quite by chance, one became available. as did a Nas-sys ROM.
This was quite legal, decent and almost honest since when I
bought a Nascom&nbsp;2 CP/M system these were on the board, and in
the price, but quite inaccessible on the memory maps.
</p>
<p>
The problem was incorporating them into the system. There
were definitely no funds available for an EPROM board, and even
if there had been, there would need to be modifications before
the ROM BASIC could be accomodated. The answer to the problems
came in a flash of inspiration (and a pool of perspiration) and
used the Dual Monitor board.
</p>
<p>
Here there are four <?php externalLink("2708"); ?> sockets, each providing access to
the data bus, most of the address bus and also power lines.
