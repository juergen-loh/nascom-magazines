This application note is intended as a guide for any
soldering iron freak who Rappens to fall into the same way oF
thinking as myself: Iwill not&rsquo; guarantee that what&rsquo; hac been
accomplished on my system will work nor that it will not destray
wnat you have ncrimped and saved lovingly te build over the last
seven or eight years.
</p>
<p>
The Nascom&nbsp;1 is an excellent machine even without the
addition of Nas-sys, and a lot more powerful than many people
</p>
<p>
realise, but in the light of the Nascom&nbsp;2, 1 has. somewhat
paled, although with the time and effort losi in the &ldquo;bankrupcy&rdquo;
period, the total system has somewhat paled in the Light of what
</p>
<p>
You ean now get for the same cost&rdquo; In defence af the concept, 1
must add that what you Tose in getting a complete working system
from another source is more valuable to me than the money saved,
but then [am funny that way. You probably are too.

<p>
1 acquired my Nascom&nbsp;1 many years ago and it served several
purposes before being consigned to its box to gather dust while
Tet to work (paid) an a number of dz fferent systems. My work
eventually moved on ta the Nascom&nbsp;2 as a base for an o-tiim.
learning system and interest im fhe Nascom&nbsp;1 was regenerated to
the extent of acquiring a buffer Board and a Tak RAM card.
</p>
<p>
During ay original researches wth the Nascom&nbsp;1, 1 had
expanded to the e-tent of Clsoft Tiny BASIC which 1 fitted to
the standard machine using the Bits # P.C 5 dual monitor board
and f must commend this (Gf it +5 sti]] available) te anyone who
wants a cheap training systea for BASIC. fut. although I wrote a
Targe number of useful prograns (ibe calculating Pi to several
thousand places) with the unezpandey Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CCsolt system, the
prospect of having so mich extra storage did not appmal to ay
Pioneering spirit, and T footed for a better vehicle &lsquo; explore
the wide-open spaces.
</p>
<p>
The answer was abviously the ROM BASIC from the Nascom&nbsp;2 and
squite ly chance. one became available. as did Nas-sys ROM.
Thre was quite Legal. decent and. almost&rsquo; honest since when 1
bought a Nascan 2 CP/M system these were on the hoard, and. in
the price, but quite inaccessible on the memory maps
</p>
<p>
The problem was incorporating them into the system. Tere
were definitely no funds available for an EPROM board. and even
TF there had been, there would Need ta be modifications before
the ROM BASIC could be accomodated, The answer to. the&rdquo; problems
came in a flash of inspiration (and a pool of perspiration) and
Used the Dual Honitar board.
</p>
<p>
Hece there are four 2708 sockets, each providing access to
the data bus, most of the address&rsquo; bus and also. power lines:
