2) /XROME When address E000-FFFF is active low and BS? (Bank
Select) is low (indicating any bank except 4 is
selected? then gate 2 ensures that /KROME goes active
Tow. It is looped along the /0E pin 20s of the @ extra
EPROMS. Whether one of these is actually enabled
depends on the output of IC 46.
</p>
<p>
3) /XRONC When address C000-E000 15 active low and B52 12 low
(any bank selected except 4) then gate 4 ensures that
/RROMC goos active low and is Looped along Link blocks
1 to 8 (NOT 9 pins 10, to connect to the /0E pin 20s
of the original EPROMS in the erght Nascom sockets.
Again, which one is actually selected depends on the
putpue of IC 48.
</p>
<p>
4) /BROM When Port 3, Bank 4 is selected, BS2 goes high and
gate 2 being an &ldquo;OR&rdquo; gate /XROME must be deselected.
Meanwhile, /BS2 15 low and gate tis an OR&rdquo; so, as
Jong as address is E000, /EROM is active and BASIC
occupies bank 4 E000-FFFF.

flip-flops contained an the 74LS175.
</p>
<p>
The reset line connected to pin 1 of the 74LS175 ensures
that bank 0 is always selected on power-up or reset. Pin 9 may
be regarded as a chip telect pin, enabled by pin 9 of the IN/OUT
PROM IC 26.

Construction takes one evening and is easy but painstaring.
Wire wrap sockets are soldered carefully to the @ EPROM that
are to be selected at C000-DFFF. These go into the eight Nascom
Fockets. The G EPROMS to be selerted at E000-FFFF have pin 20
carefully bent out to take a seperate /OE signal. They then
Piggyback into the Bnew sockets. Wire wrap sockets are not
essential but give some cooling space between the mated EPROMS.
T Tost na EPROMs doing this.
</p>
<p>
The control board uses a wire wrap socket to plug into LKSL
an place of the header plug. It therefore holds 4 sockets. 2
fourteen in and 2 sixteen pin sockets. It han 10 leads to the
board. Pins 2 and 1S of IC 44 have to be bent. out af their
socket before connection. De not forget the 5 volt and Ground.
</p>
<p>
I cannot claim to have tested the board fully. 1 cannot
afford enough EPROMS. T have pigay-backed six 27325. and moved
them around and can find no faults, Indeed, the board appears to
work with no wait states at 4 Meg. I drew a wiring. diagran but
Tt waz such a mess I thought you would da better without it. 1
have checked the circuit diagram very. carefully to ensure it
contains all necessary information, I can only marvel at the
flexibility of there fantastic Littie computers.
