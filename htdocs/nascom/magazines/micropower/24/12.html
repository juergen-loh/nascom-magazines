2)</td><td>/XROME&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>When address E000-FFFF is active low and BS2 (Bank
Select) is low (indicating any bank except 4 is
selected) then gate 2 ensures that /XROME goes active
low. It is looped along the /OE pin 20s of the 8 extra
EPROMS. Whether one of these is actually enabled
depends on the output of IC&nbsp;46.

3)</td><td>/XROMC&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>When address C000-E000 is active low and BS2 is low
(any bank selected except 4) then gate 4 ensures that
/XROMC goes active low and is looped along link blocks
1 to 8 (NOT 9) pins 10, to connect to the /OE pin 20s
of the original EPROMS in the eight Nascom sockets.
Again, which one is actually selected depends on the
output of IC&nbsp;46.

4)</td><td>/BROM&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>When Port 3, Bank 4 is selected, BS2 goes high and
gate 2 being an &lsquo;OR&rsquo; gate /XROME must be deselected.
Meanwhile, /BS2 is low and gate 1 is an &lsquo;OR&rsquo; so, as
long as address is E000+, /BROM is active and BASIC
occupies bank 4 E000-FFFF.

control the bank select. The output is steady
depending on the last inputs to D0, D1 and D2 of the 3
flip-flops contained an the 74LS175.

<p>
The reset line connected to pin 1 of the 74LS175 ensures
that bank 0 is always selected on power-up or reset. Pin 9 may
be regarded as a chip select pin, enabled by pin 9 of the IN/OUT
PROM IC&nbsp;26.

Construction takes one evening and is easy but painstaking.
Wire wrap sockets are soldered carefully to the 8 EPROMs that
are to be selected at C000-DFFF. These go into the eight Nascom
sockets. The 8 EPROMS to be selected at E000-FFFF have pin 20
carefully bent out to take a seperate /OE signal. They then
piggy-back into the 8 new sockets. Wire wrap sockets are not
essential but give some cooling space between the mated EPROMS.
I lost no EPROMs doing this.
</p>
<p>
The control board uses a wire wrap socket to plug into LKS1
in place of the header plug. It therefore holds 4 sockets, 2
fourteen pin and 2 sixteen pin sockets. It has 10 leads to the
board. Pins 2 and 13 of IC&nbsp;46 have to be bent out of their
socket before connection. Do not forget the 5&nbsp;volt and Ground.
</p>
<p>
I cannot claim to have tested the board fully. I cannot
afford enough EPROMS. I have piggy-backed six 2732s and moved
them around and can find no faults. Indeed, the board appears to
work with no wait states at 4&nbsp;Meg. I drew a wiring diagram but
it was such a mess I thought you would da better without it. I
have checked the circuit diagram very carefully to ensure it
contains all necessary information. I can only marvel at the
flexibility of there fantastic littie computers.
