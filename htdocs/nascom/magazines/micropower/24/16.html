That gave me a clue anyway. Copy st into RAM at EaauH and
execute the RAM version. Uff with&rdquo; the poner, out wth the
Soldering iron. check with the mangal and swap. the selects 0
the S000H and 400% blocks with the EovoH and FOOGH Blacks.

<p>
Switch on, copy 2000H bytes from 4000H ta E000H using the
&ldquo;cr and give it a J&rsquo;. Garbage appears on the screen, Nas-sys
functions irregularly and both the BASIC ROM and the area at
000H tabulate rubhi th:

another abandoned project that happens tobe lying around and
decide to populate the RAM B card fully.

The system now works but in the process several discover:es
have brought out a T:ttle entigntenment.
</p>
<p>
The system is now configured as follows. Nas-sys is in two
270Hs at COON with the usual screen and Nascom&nbsp;1 workspace up
to 0FFFH. There are two banks of 16K RAMS from 1000H_ ta&rdquo; GFFFH
uhich gives mea 52k wortepace far the BASIC. JOU0H to 9FFFH Ls
empty but t= mapped to the 2/f4 socket on the Dual Honttor beard
to give two copies in the ak space. The BASIC ROM resides from
AOOGH ta BFFFH and the Tast ban} of RAM runs from COOH to
FFF,

To wort the system in BASIC, it 18 necessary to perfarm a &lsquo;C
A000 FoGU 20007 FoI] Dned by a &lsquo;J&rsquo;. There is na reason why the
&ldquo;I&rdquo; command can not be doctored to carry out the copying
procedure and I intend doing this as soon as possible.

a 1 had suspected, the ROM was not fast enough to wart
without wait states, even at 2 MHZ, and it- appeared. that the
data lines could not change fast enough during an opcade-fetch
cycle ta keep up- It was lucky that. the Nascom&nbsp;1 single-step
function works in ROM areas as it clearly showed the effect. The
first insteuctton at E000H is JM E00S or C3 Of E0. When
executed In single step mode, the program counter pointed to
203 and similarly eor all three byte instructions. there is no
problem in using the &lsquo;C&rsquo; command at 2 fitz, however, au the LOIR
Command allows time for the data hus to settle and does not make
Such speed demands an the slower ROM chip. There is naturally no
Problem once the BASIC resides in RAM

Two things will immediately stand out to these of you whe
have not allowed your computers to take over the art of adding
up. there are Noles in the memory map and there is usued RAM.
Ves, but ae you will see, these are features of the system that
once were bugs.
