NB. Bit 7 of the control word is used by the software only.
When it is set, 2716 EPROMS are in use, when reset, 2732 EPROM
are present. Bit 7 is called TBIT.

Now the listing alterations needed to work your board. I use
the original line numbers, like BASIC, to insert extra lines

It takes about four minutes to blow a 2752. I have burned
eight 2752 EPROMs from RAM and copied the eight again. I have
had no errors. I am really pleased at having saved my school the
cost of two &pound;40 EPROM boards and a &pound;60 EPROM burner, at the
expense of two 1 Meg resistors. Not bad eh! Incidently Mr. Boyd,
how can I piggy-back another 4 banks of EPROM on top of my
present four to give eight banks of 8K plus BASIC? I am serious,
it would really be useful to us. Oh, and if you are ever in the
