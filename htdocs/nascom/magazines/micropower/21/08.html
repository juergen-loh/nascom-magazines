Anyone who has owned a Nascom for any great length of time will tell you
that, unlike systems that arrive in ready-made plastic cases, Nascoms tend to
expand almost indefinitely. The abilty to expand was designed into the system
from the very beginning, and it shows. When you start out, you think that a 32K
RAM board will never be too small. There is left over space in the memory map,
and a great many of the expansion boards that are available are memory mapped,
which means that they appear to the CPU to be memory, and they take up memory
space. Then one day you upgrade your system to 64K of RAM, or perhaps even
more than that, because the Nascom will allow you to have enormous amounts of
RAM (unlike the aforementioned plastic boxes&hellip;). Now your memory mapped sound
generator board, programmable character generator, and home made digital clock
card become nuisances, as they overlap some of your nice new memory.
</p>
<p>
So you have to find a way of preventing the waste of memory, and the
Nascom provides it in the form of memory paging. Your main RAM board will be
on page&nbsp;0, and all your memory mapped &lsquo;extras&rsquo; (unless you have more than 64K
of them) will be on page&nbsp;1, 2 or 3.
</p>
<p>
So this means that you will have to fit a paging circuit to each of these
boards, doesn&rsquo;t it? No, it doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; one will do! There are some spare lines on the
bus, called NDEF1 and NDEF2 in the Gemini 80 specification, and shown as
&lsquo;reserved&rsquo; in the Nasbus specification, which can be used in more or less any way
you wish. I suggest that they should be used to carry the read and write signals to
all boards that are on memory page&nbsp;3.
</p>
<p>
Only a simple modification is needed on each of these boards, instead of
the quite complex task of adding a paging circuit to each of them. The single paging
circuit can be built on a prototyping board, of which there tends to be at least one
in any system that has reached this stage of development.
</p>
<p>
Modify each board that is to appear on page&nbsp;3 as shown in diagram 2, or fit
the board with equivalent switching if you want the board to be usable on systems
without the page&nbsp;3 signals, or with software that has not allowed for the use of
paged addressing.
</p>
<p>
The circuit to provide the page&nbsp;3 read and write signals is shown in diagram
1. It will not take up much space on the prototyping board, as it consists of very
few components. It could even be fitted to the end of the mother board if you are
that short of space. A header should be made up with links from pins 1 to 16 and
5 to 12 for page&nbsp;3 operation; different header connections will allow for different
page selections it is even possible to have the read signal on one page and the
