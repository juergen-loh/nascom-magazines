EDITORIAL
</h1>
<p>
This is the first issue of Volume 2 of micropower and the start of our first full year
of publication. There will be six issues this year at approximately 2 month intervals,
so the next magazine will appear at the end of April.
When we started the magazine in August last year (what a long time ago that
seems) we were unsure that there would be enough interest in a Nascom
magazine to provide the necessary support, although we felt that was a tremendous
fund of enthusiasm in the Nascom clubs and computer groups up and down the
country.
</p>
<p>
It appears that the interest does exist &ndash; the magazine has sold well (we have
had to have reprints of the early issues) and, even more important, articles have
been sent in for publication. This does not mean that we have enough articles for
the magazine &ndash; we are always pleased to receive more, so sit down NOW and write
up your pet projects.
</p>
<p>
Remember that the composition of the magazine reflects the interests of the
&lsquo;active&rsquo; readers &ndash; that is, the readers who also contribute. If you feel that the
magazine should contain articles on a certain topic you could write in and ask
someone to write them, but a better way is to write a short article yourself. You
have a head start, because all your readers will be Nascom enthusiasts; all you have
to do is to communicate your particular interest.
