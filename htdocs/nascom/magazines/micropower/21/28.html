Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Re the &ldquo;Nascom&nbsp;1 Keyboard Upgrade&rdquo;, an interesting article currently under
construction, readers may be interested to know that Licon Keys (the later angled
variety) are available from Target Electronics, __, ______ ____, Bristol, ___ ___.
Prices in December 1981 were; Keyswitch 65p each., Keytop 17p each.
My only criticism of the magazine &ldquo;so far&rdquo; is that the density of the type varies
considerably, some is difficult to read.

<p>
On expanding my Nascom&nbsp;1 to include a 64K RAM card, EPROM expansion
card with 8K Basic running under Nasbug T4 I encountered a hardware problem.
Executing FOR loops with large values, i.e., greater than 1000, produced
&ldquo;crashes&rdquo;; Basic programs occasionally jump to machine code, and vice versa.
After considerable difficulty I tried connecting a thick lead (20 A current capability)
directly from the Z80 earth pin to 0&nbsp;V on the Buffer board. To date this has cured
all programming problems.

Dear Sir,

<p>
In the program &ldquo;Rings of Hanoi&rdquo; on p. 31 of the December <a href="../text/"></a>issue of
Micropower, I think the following corrections are needed:&ndash;
</p>
<pre>
220 A (I, 0) = I:A(I&nbsp;,1) = 0: A (I, 2)=0
290 SCREEN 1,1: PRINT : SCREEN 6,15
400 GOSUB 920: SCREEN 2,2:PRINT: SCREEN 2,2: PRINT "MOVE FROM";
410 INPUT IN$
420 GOSUB 1300:TF=IN:IF TF &lt; 0 THEN 400
440 SCREEN 1,1:PRINT:SCREEN1,1
470 GOSUB 920:SCREEN 2,2:PRINT: SCREEN 2,2: PRINT "TO PILE";

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
The content of Micropower is quite good and the technical level is about right,
I think the hardware/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>software mix is probably O.K., although I would personally like
to see more programs in each issue.
I have managed to make the &ldquo;Snowdinger&rdquo; mod work at 2&nbsp;Mhz and 4&nbsp;Mhz,
although I have had to delay the WAIT signal by two gate propagations in order to
get the system to operate at 2&nbsp;Mhz. The improvement in screen quality is
excellent.

The dual monitor (2716 for 2708s) was nearly correct, though it is not permissible
to wire &lsquo;or&rsquo; the two outputs of a 74LS139 &ndash; it is necessary to combine the signals
correctly by using, for example, a 7402.
