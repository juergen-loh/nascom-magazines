For the same reason, a line feed (code &pound;0A) is output after a carriage return
(&pound;0D), as most systems need both signals; however, the line feed can be
suppressed by setting bit 4 of the option byte. The Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 external output routine
ignores nulls, but Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 has been modified so that nulls are output correctly.
The many options available make this a very powerful command. Because
the user output routine is automatically brought into operation when the X command
is invoked, you can have a parallel printer on line in addition to the Nascom
keyboard and an ASCII terminal (for example, a teletype keyboard and printer). Of
course, you must set up the user output routine by storing the address at &pound;0C78 in
the usual way.

YJUMP Y
</p>
<p>
In Nas-Sys&nbsp;1, Y produces an error message &ndash; the address in the subroutine
table is &pound;030A. Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 uses Y to jump to &pound;B000; this will normally be used to
access software in an EPROM at this address, such as the Basic &lsquo;Programmer&rsquo; s
Aid&rsquo; or an entension to the monitor. I have the initialisation routine for my printer
here, so that Y configures the PIO ports, clears the print buffer and resets the
printer options.

<p>
ZJUMP Z
</p>
<p>
This command is normally used to &lsquo; warm star&rsquo;t the Microsoft Basic at &pound;FFFD.
0f course, if you haven&rsquo; t got the Basic in ROM you can use the command to
access other software by changing the address stored for the Z command. I use it
to access Zeap, using Z for a warm start and ZC for a cold start. Because C is a valid
hexadecimal number, you can use it as an argument to a command. The software
at the start of the command tests the value in the L register; if it is &pound;0C, it does a
jump to the cold start address, otherwise it does a warm start. This has two
advantages. Firstly, it gives you two commands for the price of one &ndash; when you
start modifying your software you soon run out of command letters. Secondly, it
reduces the chance of performing a cold start when you meant a warm start; it
still happens, but not as often. There always seems to be room in the software you
are accessing for the extra code needed to test the value of ARG1.
</p>
<p>
However, there is a snag. I tried the same ystem for Basic, using J for a warm
and JC for a cold start. I then found that I couldn&rsquo;t RUN programs that appeared to
CLOAD correctly. On LISTing garbage was displayed. The reason was that the
argument C was used as an offset in the Nas-Sys&nbsp;3. READ routine used by CLOAD
&ndash; the program was being read in to an address twelve bytes higher than the correct
address.
