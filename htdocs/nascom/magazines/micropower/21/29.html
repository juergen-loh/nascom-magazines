Dear Editor,
</p>
<p>
The contents of the magazine seem quite well balanced&nbsp;&ndash; there must be
something in each issue of interest to every Nascom user. I would like to see some
explanation of essential parts of programmes, i.e. brief notes on those parts of
software on which the operation depends. For example, a note on how the highres
graph plotting software works would have been interesting. I would be
particularly interested in articles on fault finding techniques for or with the Nascom.
If anyone knows of a cheap and reliable MODEM design then the details would be
most welcome.
</p>

The Lincoln computer club now meets on the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each
