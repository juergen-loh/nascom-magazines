Nasprint 80
</p>
<p>
Nasprint 80 is a 2K progam which greatly extends and
</p>
<p>
simplifies the operation of Nas-Pen.New functions
</p>
<p>
supplied by Nasprint 80 include:
</p>
<p>
1 &amp; 2
</p>
<p>
Pagination
</p>
<p>
Output a title in each page
</p>
<p>
Centre title
</p>
<p>
Text formatting with embedded control codes, e.g.
</p>
<p>
Change line length; change line spacing; change
</p>
<p>
margins; centre line between margins; new page; output
</p>
<p>
control codes to printer.
</p>
<p>
The program contains a parallel printer routine for a
</p>
<p>
Centronics type interface, specifically designed for the
</p>
<p>
Epron MX-80,but the program can be used with any
</p>
<p>
printer, parallel or serial, as the output is routed through
</p>
<p>
an address in RAM.
</p>
<p>
The program also facilitates the operation of a printer
</p>
<p>
with Zeap, Nas-Dis, De-bug, Nas-Sys &amp; ROM Basic; the
</p>
<p>
software/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>firmware being used is selected from a menu
</p>
<p>
and Nasprint 80 then changes the necessary addresses to
</p>
<p>
produce hard copy output.
</p>
<p>
The program is supplied in 2x2708&rsquo;s or in one
</p>
<p>
2716,together with instructions for fitting 2716&rsquo;s in the
</p>

AY-3-8910 Programmable Sound Chip
</p>
<p>
YES &ndash; This IS the amazingly powerful &ldquo;Clang, Bang, Zap,
</p>
<p>
Tweet&rdquo; sound &amp; music generator, with three channels
</p>
<p>
which can be independently programmed for sound
</p>
<p>
output and amplitude.In addition it has an &lsquo;envelope
</p>
<p>
controlled&rsquo; noise generator, ideal for creating explosions
</p>
<p>
and firing sounds. &pound;6.45
</p>
<p>
Sound Chip Data Manual (60 pages)
</p>
<p>
This contains a full description of the architecture &amp;
</p>
<p>
operation of the chip, detailed advice on the interfacing to
</p>
<p>
various microprocessors, and comprehensive
</p>
<p>
explanations on the generation of music and sound

<p>
Sound Chip Interface Board
</p>
<p>
The board has been designed to interface between the
</p>
<p>
Parallel Input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Output Port (PIO) of the Nascom and the
</p>
<p>
sound chip. It is supplied ready-built and just plugs
</p>
<p>
straight onto your PIO connector. Nascom&nbsp;1 connectors
</p>
<p>
available on request. Sound generation is illustrated in
</p>
<p>
machine code &amp; Basic (chip not included) &pound;13.50
</p>
<p>
Sound Chip Demo Program (MC)
</p>
<p>
A brief summary of the main registers is given, together
</p>
<p>
with a description of their functions. Thereafter, two
</p>
<p>
separate modes may be selected. Direct mode allows
</p>
<p>
values to be entered into the chip registers via the
</p>
<p>
keyboard, making experimentation simple, thus leading to
</p>
<p>
a rapid appreciation of the chip&rsquo;s potential. The second
</p>
<p>
mode turns the keyboard into a 7 octave &lsquo;piano&rsquo;,
</p>
<p>
displaying the notes being played as well as the values in
</p>
<p>
the registers. &pound;5.95
