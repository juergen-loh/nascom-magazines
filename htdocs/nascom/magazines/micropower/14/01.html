We must first apologise for the late appearance of this, the December issue of
Micropower. New Year&rsquo;s Resolution &ndash; we must do better in 1982.
On the basis of the response from readers, and the amount of material we are
being sent by contributors, we have decided to produce six issues in 1982 at
approximately two-month intervals, the first issue to appear towards the end of
February.
</p>
<p>
The price of Micropower will remain the same &ndash; 95p per issue, so a year&rsquo;s
subscription will be &pound;5.70. This includes postage and packing, but only for the British
Isles. Please 65p per copy for Europe, &pound;1.05 per copy for printed paper air mail to the
rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
As always, we are still looking for contributors. Write about your pet projects,
hardware or software &ndash; what they do, how they do it, how you would like to develop
them in future.

There was a time in 1981 when it looked as though Nascom would disappear
without trace. Now, with Lucas at the helm, 1982 should be the year when the
Nascom system at last &lsquo;takes of&rsquo; and justifies the faith that its many supporters have
had in it.
