ANOTHER COMMAND (Y/N)?
</p>
<p>
No name is entered for the first section of machine code, as this code is a series
of subroutines used in the AUTO command. Addresses entered under the &lsquo;+&rsquo; option
are measured relative to the start of the current section of code being entered. Thus
any references to subroutines which precede the current section will be negative. For
example, in the second section of code, the AUTO command, there are three
references to the subroutines in the first section which are all entered as negative
hexadecimal numbers (FFC4, FFF0, FFEE).
</p>
<p>
The six bytes of workspace used by the AUTO routines can be entered as any six
8 bit values &ndash; in the example above they are entered as six FF&rsquo;s.
