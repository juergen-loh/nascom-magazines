SINGLE STEP S xxxx
</h3>
<p>
The Single Step command initially uses part of the machine code used by the
Execute command, described in
<a href="../../../12/26/text/#article1">article 2</a>. It enters the Execute routine at the point at
which it throws away the return address by POPing it into AF; it thus misses out the
section which sets the workspace byte CONFLG (&pound;0C26) to &minus;1, and this remains at
zero. Continuing with the Execute machine code routine, the Single Step command
saves the specified start address in the monitor workspace, loads registers BC, DE,
HL, AF and SP from the register save area in the workspace, and pushes the start
address onto the top of the stack. The AF registers are then saved while bit 3 of port
0 is set; this activates a TTL circuit which sends a non-maskable interrupt to the
processor after four M1 cycles. The AF registers are recovered, and this is followed
by a return-from NMI instruction (RETN, ED 45), which, because the start address
was pushed on the top of the stack, causes the program to start executing at this
address. Three M1 cycles have now occurred (one each time a byte is fetched from
memory), so as soon as the next instruction is started the NMI line is activated, and
the processor is interrupted at the end of this instruction.
</p>
<p>
This causes the processor to jump to the NMI handling routine. Here bit 3 of port
0 is reset, and the value stored at CONFLG is tested. If the value is not zero the
program must have arrived at this point from an Execute command, and the routine
continues as described in the
<a href="../../../12/26/text/#article1">second article</a>.
If CONFLG is zero the top 10 bytes of
the user stack, which contain the value of the program counter register for the next
instruction of the program being single-stepped (pushed on the stack as the return
address by the NMI) and the AF, HL, DE and BC registers, are copied to the register
save area in the monitor workspace. The contents of these registers, together with
the user stack pointer, the interrupt register and the index registers IX and IY, are
then printed on the screen.
</p>
<p>
In Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 the routine which prints the registers is part of the NMI/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Breakpoint
handling routine, but in Nas-Sys3 it is written as a separate subroutine which can be
accessed by command P or called from other programs. The format of the register
print out is also different in the two monitors. In Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 only the registers are
printed out, in the order:&ndash;

SP &nbsp; &nbsp; PC &nbsp; &nbsp; AF &nbsp; &nbsp; HL &nbsp; &nbsp; DE &nbsp; &nbsp; BC &nbsp; &nbsp; I &nbsp; &nbsp; IX &nbsp; &nbsp; IY
</p>
<p>
followed by a string of letters indicating which of the bits in the flag register are set. In
Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 the display of each of the first six register pairs is followed by the sixteen
bit value held in the memory location to which the register pair points. Thus if the H
