Nasprint 80
Nasprint 80 is a 2K program which greatly extends and
simplifies the operation of Nas-Pen. New functions
supplied by Nasprint 80 includes:
Pagination
Output a page number of each page
Output a title on each page
Centre title
Text formatting with embedded control codes. e.g.
Change line length; change line spacing; change
margins; centre line between margins; new page; output
control codes to printer.
The program contains a parallel printer routine for a
Centronics type interface, specifically designed for the
Epsom MX-80, but the program can be used with any
printer, parallel or serial, as the output is routed through
an address in RAM.
The program also facilitates the operation of a printer
with Zeap, Nas-Dis, De-bug, Nas-Sys &amp; ROM Basic; the
software/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>firmware being used is selected fro a menu and
Nasprint 80 then changes the necessary addresses to
produce a hard copy output.
The program is supplied in 2x2708&rsquo;s for fitting 2716&rsquo;s in
the RAM&nbsp;A card. &pound;14.95
New Fase (16K/MC/G)
New version of the space invaders type with each new
fleet of invaders having a different shape &amp; kind of
motion.Missiles fired at you come straight down or
diagonally left to right &amp; vice versa.
Destroy one &lsquo;fase&rsquo; &amp; move onto the next. The fuel level is
shown graphically and you can refuel if you obliterate
four fleets. Your score is shown at the end of a game and
the top ten scorers are ranked. Once again the difficulty
level has been set very high. &pound;7.95
Starship Command (16K/B/G)
The &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; Space Adventure for &lsquo;thinking&rsquo;
campaigners!
You command the sole fighting ship of a small league of
planets who are pledged to resist the oppression of the
powerful Terran Federation.
The 3-dimensional planetary system is divided into 729
sectors (9x9x9), your viewscreen revealing neighbouring
sectors 5 wide by 3 high by 3 deep. It can be rotated to
look up &amp; down as well as N,S,E &amp; W.
You will encounter friendly, neutral &amp; hostile planets and,
of course, enemy interceptors. Your long term objective
is to raise the morale of the system&rsquo;s inhabitants so as to
bring forth a spontaneous rebellion against the
Federation. This can be achieved progressively by
winning in combat and converting neutral planets. The
opposite occurs if you flee from a fight, upset neutral
planets or just skulk!
Machine-code sub-routines ensure the clashes with the
enemy are exciting. There are six levels of skill and many
other features. Full instructions are given in a separate
program. &pound;9.95
Moon Raider ( MC/G)
The &lsquo;Scramble&rsquo; game you have been waiting for!! Blast
the asteroids, enemy missiles &amp; ramships out of the sky
as you skim over the mountains on the moon&rsquo;s surface.
Bomb the fuel dumps and enemy defences. Higher points
scored for hits closer to the ground. Maximise your total
score on restricted supplies of fuel. If you survive the first
part of the game you enter the &lsquo;tunnel&rsquo;, with rocky
projections above &amp; below you! Four skill levels,
excellent graphics &amp; excrutiating sound via the keyboard
port. &pound;8.95
