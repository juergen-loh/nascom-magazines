Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Further to Mr. Bowden&rsquo;s letter in issue 3, I must also add my congratulations to
Chris Blackmore for his excellent MONITOR.COM, which I call N3.COM allowing me
to type N3 and be in Nas-Sys. I cannot help him to convert the RAM version of
Zeap 2 to run with the moved video RAM, but I can help anyone who wants to run
the EPROM version. The bytes to be changed are:&ndash;
</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
<table style="width: 60%; margin: 0 20%">
<tr><td>D5D4</td><td>D62D</td><td>D62D</td><td>D83C</td><td>D844</td><td>DB1F</td><td>DB7D</td><td>DBE3</td><td>DBF4</td></tr>
<tr><td>DBFD</td><td>DC06</td><td>DC06</td><td>DC12</td><td>DC68</td><td>DCA5</td><td>DCAE</td><td>DCB8</td><td>DDC8</td></tr>
<tr><td>DE06</td><td>DE16</td><td>DE16</td><td>DE26</td><td>DE59</td><td>DE95</td><td>DECD</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
If the modifications suggested in INMC7 have been carried out, it will be
necessary to change the byte at DFBA. Each of the addresses at these bytes will be
found to be in the range 08 &ndash; 0B; F0 should be added. If it is required to run the
EPROM version in RAM for test purposes, the byte at DF52 should be changed to
00.
</p>
<p>
In order to run D-BUG and Nas-Dis with the revised video RAM, it is only
necessary to change the bytes at C01A, C0B3 and C118.

Dear Ed,
</p>
<p>
After reading the article on TRS-80 tapes in issue 3, I thought the following
might be of interest.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to read UK101 tapes directly and very simply. Providing the tape
has been recorded at 300 or 1200 Baud (most will be at 300), go into mode X from
Nas-Sys, initialise Basic with the J command, and then play the tape without
entering any commands. The program listing will be printed onto the screen and
into memory with the original Basic line numbers. On completion, the program can
be modified to run on the Nascom with usually not too much effort!

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I recently bought a V&amp;T Superdeck recorder, which came with a demo tape but
no instructions. As the company has closed down, is there anyone who can tell me
how to connect the Superdeck to my Nascom&nbsp;2. The twelve connections are marked
C, S, R, W, E, D and G, Common, Tx and Rx Clock, and Tx and Rx Data. I&rsquo;d be
grateful for any help.
