After reading an article in Computing Today written by Don
Thomasson, I got an idea to write a program which can copy the
contents of the Nascom screen directly to an Epson MXG0 F/T type
2printer by means of &ldquo;Bit Image Mode&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Graphics and alphanumerics are directly transferred and you
can choose between black on white or white on black,
</p>
<p>
The usual MXBO F/T type 1 may only be used if it is equipped
with GRAFTAX. The GRAFTAX may need some other initialisation.
</p>
<p>
The first thing to be done is to place 2 copy of the Nascom
CHORACTER and NAS-GRA EPROHs inta the Nascoms memory space. In
my case it resides from 9000H to 9FFFH.
</p>
<p>
The main program resides in ROM from A000H&nbsp;. To start the
copy T have used the 1 command in and) altered it to
paint to A000H and if I add an &ldquo;Fr the copy will be
Inverted. The program can also be called from BASIC with 2 USR
routine call to AOOSH.
</p>
<p>
The problem I had in witing the progran was that the Nascom
characters have 16 lines and the printer only has 8 needles in
&lsquo;bit image made&rsquo;. The printer has to go 2 lines for each Nascom
line sal had to use a buffer to store the &lsquo;bit image&rsquo; of one
Naucom ling before it is Sent to the printer.
</p>
<p>
The program contains its ow printer routine since ay usual
routine rejects Linefeed code 0AH.
