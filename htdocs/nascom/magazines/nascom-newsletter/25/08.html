After reading an article in Computing Today written by Don
Thomasson, I got an idea to write a program which can copy the
contents of the Nascom screen directly to an Epson MX80 F/T type
2 printer by means of &lsquo;Bit Image Mode&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Graphics and alphanumerics are directly transferred and you
can choose between black on white or white on black.
</p>
<p>
The usual MX80 F/T type 1 may only be used if it is equipped
with GRAFTAX. The GRAFTAX may need some other initialisation.
</p>
<p>
The first thing to be done is to place a copy of the Nascom
<span class="uppercase">Character</span> and NAS-GRA EPROMs into the Nascoms memory space. In
my case it resides from 9000H to 9FFFH.
</p>
<p>
The main program resides in ROM from A000H&nbsp;. To start the
copy I have used the L command in Nas-sys and altered it to
point to A000H and if I add an &lsquo;F&rsquo; as ARG1, the copy will be
inverted. The program can also be called from BASIC with a USR
routine call to A003H.
</p>
<p>
The problem I had in writing the program was that the Nascom
characters have 16 lines and the printer only has 8 needles in
&lsquo;bit image made&rsquo;. The printer has to go 2 lines for each Nascom
line so I had to use a buffer to store the &lsquo;bit image&rsquo; of one
Nascom line before it is sent to the printer.
</p>
<p>
The program contains its own printer routine since my usual
routine rejects linefeed code 0AH.
