By special request (and much pestering after seeing my
system &ndash; sorry chaps) I will proceed to enlighten those of you
that asked for details of how it&rsquo;s done &ndash; it is in fact quite
easy to do and forms the basis of a very flexible system
especially when using 64k of RAM&nbsp;, however I modified my system
so that I always had a full 48k of RAM available &ndash; this of
course meant that all firmware must reside between D000 and
FFFF which by the by means that all software needs to be
relocated ...... After many hours I have produced source
listing for most of the software and ended up as follows....

<table>
<tr><td>Page&nbsp;1 contains</td><td>ZEAP&nbsp;, NAS DIS&nbsp;, DEBUG&nbsp;, NAS PEN and optionally
DCS DOS&nbsp;/ NAS DOS&nbsp;/ nothing.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Page&nbsp;2 contains</td><td>general utilities and other debugging aids.<br>
(not yet full)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Page&nbsp;3 contains</td><td>BLS PASCAL and NAS DOS at the wrong address
which I load to the correct address when
needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Page&nbsp;4&nbsp;contains</td><td>BASIC (8k ROM) and a miscellanious mass of
TOOLKITS and BASIC EXTENSIONS.</td></tr>

Page switching is very easy and consists of outputting to
Port FF the page number which incidently are NOT 1, 2, 3, 4 &ndash;
but 0 to disable the card and 1, 3, 5, 7 for each of the
pages. This provides the simplest modifications with maximum
flexibility.
</p>
<p>
Now to the &ldquo;Nitty Gritty&rdquo; &ndash; the mods are in two parts,
firstly to allow the fitting of 4k EPROMs, and. secondly to
provide the switching under software control.

MODIFICATION TO FIT 2732 EPROMS

<p>
Ready &ndash; REMOVE all capacitors which are situated along
side the EPROM sockets and with the following numbers 28, 30,
32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56 and 58. This
frees the highest address line (which normally goes to the +5v
supply).
</p>
<p>
With reference to fig&nbsp;1 wire each of the link blocks as
shown, each one being wired the same way. Identify the track
plate through hole near IC8 and link it to the right-hand centre
pin of all the link blocks. This provides the new highest order
address line.
</p>
<p>
Selection of address blocks is just as before except that
each block is now 16k long (not 4/8k). If for any reason you
decide to start a block on an odd numbered address (ie B000)
then the address locations of each EPROM in the block will not
