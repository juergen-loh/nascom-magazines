The &ldquo;How to fit 64K of EPROM to your Nascom Hods
ao"How to Page Tt&rdquo;

<p>
By special request (and much pestering after seeing ay
system &ndash; sorry chaps) I will proceed te enlighten those of you
that auked for details of how it&rsquo;s done itis in fact quite
eany to do and foras the basis of a very flexible system
especially when using 64 of RAM&nbsp;, however I modified my system
</p>
<p>
se that I always had a full 4Gk of RAM available this of
Course meant that all firmware must reside between D000 and
FRE which by the by means that all software feeds to be

<p>
relocated .. .:.. After many hours I have produced source
</p>
<p>
Listing for mast of the software and ended up as follow
</p>
<p>
Page 1 contains ZEAP&nbsp;, NAS DIS&nbsp;, DEBUG&nbsp;, NAS PEN and optionally
DCS Das 7 NAS DOS 7 nothing.
</p>
<p>
Page 2 contains general utilities and other debugging aids,
</p>
<p>
(not yet full)
</p>
<p>
Page 3 contains BLS PASCAL and NAS DOS at the wrong address
which T load to the correct addrese hen
needed.
</p>
<p>
Page 4 contains BASIC (8k ROM) and a miscellanious mass of
TOOLKITS and BASIC EXTENSIONS.
</p>
<p>
Page switching is very easy and consists of outputting to
Port FF the page number which incidently are NOT ty 2, 3, 4 &mdash;
but &copy; to disable the card and 1, 3,3, 7 for &lsquo;each of the
pages. This provides the simplest &lsquo;modifications with maximum
Flewibility.
</p>
<p>
Now to the &ldquo;Nitty Gritty&rdquo; &ndash; the mods are in two parts,
firstly to allow the fitting of 4k EPROMs, and. secondly to
provide the switching under software control:

MODIFICATION TO FIT 2732 EPROMS
</p>
<p>
Ready &ndash; REMOVE a11 capacitors which are situated along
side the EPROM sockets and with the following numbers 28,&rdquo; 50,
32, 34, 36, 3B, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56 and SB.&rdquo; This
frees the highest address line (which normally goes to the +5v
</p>
<p>
With reference to fig 1 wire each of the link blocks a
shown, each one being wired the same way. Identify the track
Plate through hole near ICH and link it to the right-hand centre
pin of all the link blocks. This provides the new highest order
Address line.
</p>
<p>
Selection of address blocks is just au before except that
each block is now 16k tong inot 4/8). Tf for any reason you
Secide to start a block on an odd numbered address (ie B000)
then the address Locations of each EPROM in the block will not
