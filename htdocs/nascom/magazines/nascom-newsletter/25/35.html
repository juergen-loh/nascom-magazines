PASCAL
</h3>
<p>
B &amp; L have made further improvements to their Pascal disc
extensions and, by all reports, this is now a very good package
and substantially better than my own, rather crude, Pas-Dos
package. As I am not personally a great fan of Pascal (no
reflection on our Pascal or B &amp; L&rsquo;s extensions!) I still have
not got round to trying it but, if you are into Pascal, it would
be well worth looking at. We will try to obtain the latest copy
so that those of you attending the exhibition can give it a try
if you want to.

EXTENDED BASIC
</h3>
<p>
The new BASIC is now available for tape users. The version
for Nas-Dos users, with disc support commands, should be
available in a few weeks time. If in the meantime you want to
try the tape version, we will offer an upgrade service, for a
modest charge, to allow you ta change the tape version for the
Nas-Dos version when it is available. Incidently, a translation
program is provided to allow ROM BASIC tapes to be converted to
XBASIC format.
</p>
<p>
We will give more details of the features of the Nas-Dos
versions and some thoughts on memory usage, in the next issue of
Nas-Dos News.

POLYSYS 4
</h3>
<p>
For those users continuing to use the ROM BASIC we have
adapted PolySys 4 to provide many useful additional features.
Thee include:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Renumber<br>
Delete<br>
Pack (remove spaces and REMs)<br>
Trace<br>
Printer support
</p>
<p>
We have chosen this package as being, in our view, the best
of the 2K aids to programming in BASIC which is available. In
operation it adjusts the input and output tables, which disables
Nas-Dos keyboard commands. In practice this is not a problem.
All you need to do is to &ldquo;]L&rdquo; your program in the usual way,
]E:POLYSYS and type Z to warm start BASIC with the additional
commands active. When you have finished using the additional
commands, you juSt press RESET to restore Nas-Dos.
</p>
<p>
An invaluable aid to program development in BASIC, and one
which I use extensively during preparation of programs in ROM
BASIC.
</p>
<p>
PolySys 4 is available now in tape form (all alternatively
EPROM for the non-disc user) and we suggest you see a
demonstration.
