PASCAL
</p>
<p>
B&amp;L have made further improvements to their Pascal disc
extensions and, by all reports, this is now a very good package
dad substantially better than my own, rather crude, Pas-Das
Package. As I sm not personally a great fan of Pascal (no
reflection on our Pascal or B &amp; Ls extensions&rsquo;) I still have
hut got round to trying it but, 1f you are into Pascal, it would,
be well worth looking at. We will try to obtain the latest copy
bo that those of you wttending the exhibition can give it a tey
SF you want to.

EXTENDED Basic
</p>
<p>
The pew BASIC 15 now available for tape users. The version
for Nas-Dos users, with dise support commands, &lsquo;should be
available in a few weeks time. If in the meantime you want to
try the tape version, we will offer an upgrade service, for a
modest charge, to allow you ta change the tape version for. the:
Nas-Dos version when i is available. Incadently, a translation
program \s provided to allow ROM BASIC tapes to be converted to
XEASIC formats
</p>
<p>
We will give mare detaris of the features of the Nas-Dos
versions and some thoughts on @emory Usage, in the next issue of
Nas-Dom News.

<p>
PoLysys 4
</p>
<p>
For those users continuing to use the ROM BASIC we have
adapted PolySys 4 to provide many useful&rdquo; additional features.
Thee include:
</p>
<p>
Renunber
Delete
</p>
<p>
Pack (remove paces and REMs)
Printer support
</p>
<p>
We have chosen this package as being, in aur view, the best
of the 2k aids to programming in BASIC which is available. In
operation it adjusts the input and output tables, which disables
Nas-Dos keyboard commands. In practice this is not a problem.
ALL you need todo is to &ldquo;JL&rdquo; your program in the usual way,
IE:POLYSYS and type Z to warm start BASIC with the additional
rommands active. When you have finished using the additional
Commands, you jUSt press RESET ta restore Aas-Dos.
</p>
<p>
fe invaluable aid to program development in BASIC, and one
which Tune extensively during preparation of programs in ROH
BASIC.
</p>
<p>
PolySys 4 16 available now in tape form (all alternatively
</p>
<p>
EPROM for the non-dise user) and we suggest you see a
demonstration.
