Nascom Microcomputer Division
</h2>
<p>
We are pleased to be associated with Micropower and to
appoint it as the official Nascom Newsletter. Over the next few
months we hope to be making a significant contribution to the
editorial pages.
</p>
<p>
This contribution will be mainly from our technical people,
both hardware and software products, but we are always
interested to hear from you if you wish to include other
subjects.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it is worth explaining our involvement with the
Micropower magazine, as this will help you understand the role
it has to play. Micropower will continue to be owned and managed
by the existing people and all production and editorial matters
will remain their responsibility. We have agreed to support the
more actively in both advertising and editorial contributions.
Essentially we see this as your Newsletter and I expect as much
contribution from you as from any other source. I am sure that
it will prove of immense benefit in communicating our plans to
you and getting your reaction to them and forming a focus on
Nascom users.
</p>
<p>
In the past few months we have been concentrating our
efforts towards the introduction of many new products, both
Hardware and software. We are convinced that the present
products offer an extremely wide choice for use with your Nascom
and represent very good value for money. In this edition, you
will find mention of some new offerings in our advertising copy,
but you would be better advised to visit your dealer to see it
demonstrated.
</p>
<p>
Over the last 18 months since Lucas aquired Nascom, we have
developed the original Kit product. into a fully-fledged,
desk-top computer. It now offers the range and sophistication of
the best 8 bit microcomputers and is certainly a powerful
performer.
</p>
<p>
In the coming months we hope to see this Newsletter become
your platform with a whole range of subjects and contributors
including a very active club corner.
