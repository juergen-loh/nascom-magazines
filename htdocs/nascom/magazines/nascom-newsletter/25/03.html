Looking at the bit patterns for the Z80 instruction set
(they are nicely tabulated in your Nascom manual &hellip; towards the
back), you will notice that many groups of instructions use the
middle three bite to represent a register, condition, arithmetic
operation, or a number from 0 to 7 (for the bitwise
operations)[r, c, a &amp; n respectively].

<table class="indent" style="width: 60%">
<tr><th>Bits</th><th>r</th><th>c</th><th>n</th><th>a</th></tr>
<tr><td>000</td><td>B</td><td>NZ</td><td>0</td><td>ADD A</td></tr>
<tr><td>001</td><td>C</td><td>Z</td><td>1</td><td>ADC</td></tr>
<tr><td>010</td><td>D</td><td>NC</td><td>2</td><td>SUB</td></tr>
<tr><td>011</td><td>E</td><td>C</td><td>3</td><td>SBC A</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>H</td><td>PO</td><td>4</td><td>AND</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>L</td><td>PE</td><td>5</td><td>XOR</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>INDIS</td><td>P</td><td>6</td><td>OR</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>A</td><td>M</td><td>7</td><td>CP</td></tr>

<p>
INDIS represents an index register HL, IX or IY (and the
displacement if necessary). A similar system operates with
register pairs.
</p>
<table class="indent" style="width: 40%">
<tr><th>Bits</th><th>ss</th><th>ad</th></tr>
<tr><td>00</td><td>BC</td><td>BC</td></tr>
<tr><td>01</td><td>DE</td><td>DE</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>IND</td><td>IND</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>SP</td><td>AF</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Where IND represents one of the index registers (HL, IX, IY)
but with no displacements. Make sure that you understand this,
because basically disassembley is analysis of bit patterns. I
did not, and wrote a disassembler so complex even I could not
make head nor tail of it!! These tables will have to go into
tables in the computer as they are crucial. You will have to
define a character to represent INDIS and IND as we don&rsquo;t yet
know which of the index registers to output!! Remember these as
if they were arrays, eg. r(0) &ndash; r(7) etc.
</p>
<p>
The disassembler is going to need one vital piece of
information before it starts. Elementary &ndash; where to start from.
This can easily be done using the Nas-Sys routine ARGS. Load
this disassembly address into BC&rsquo; (the alternate registers are
identified by &rsquo;). This piece of your program is the first
encountered on a run and is not used again. From now on the
disassembley address is always in BC&rsquo;. It must be the first byte
of an instruction or else there will be havoc!! Next thing to
do is to set STRDIS to an empty string.
</p>
<p>
Now there are two more variables &ndash; held also in the
alternate registers (use D&rsquo; and E&rsquo;) &ndash; to be initialised. Call
one INDEX, the print routine will require this. The other call
TYPE and this holds information as to whether the instruction
began with &pound;CB, &pound;ED or neither. Set both these to zero. Take a
deep breath and begin!!!
