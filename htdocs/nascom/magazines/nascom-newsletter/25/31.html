DCS-DOS
</h3>
<p>
For those of you who are wondering from the introduction
what DCS-Dos is, we will explain. For these of you who own
DCS-Dos please read on, there are some comments here directed
specifically at you.
</p>
<p>
DCS-Dos is a disc operating system which was originally
developed by Steve Parrish of Dave Computer Services for use
with the old G***** disc drives connected to the Nascom via the
<?php externalLink("Henelec"); ?>
controller and the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>. A much improved version of this
disc operating system became Nas-Dos for use with the Nascom
disc drives and the Nascom Floppy Disc Controller card. Steve
has now upgraded the original DCS-Dos to DCS-Dos 2, which is
generally similar to Nas-Dos but still for use with disc drives
fitted with the old
<?php externalLink("Henelec"); ?>
controller connected via the PIO.
</p>
<p>
To DCS-Dos owners we would like to suggest that you consider
changing to Nascom discs and the FDC board. This will give you
the following advantage:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Double disc capacity (quadruple if you go for the double-sided
drives)<br>
Media compatibility<br>
Access to all standard Nas-Dos software
</p>
<p>
The obvious problem is that you will need to buy new disc
drives and the controller card. As we have already mentioned,
there is a special offer on until the end of November so if you
are considering a change, now would be a good time. We regret
that, as we had no involvement with the sale of the original
drives, we are unable to make any other additional offer
ourselves with respect to your existing disc hardware. However,
we have agreed with DCS that if you send us your DCS-Dos chips
we will upgrade these to Nas-Dos for a charge of only 10 pounds.
This software swap should be done through ourselves rather than
dealers in order that the serialising and registration can be
performed correctly and the original DCS-Dos registration can be
cancelled.
</p>
<p>
We are looking into the possibility of making some Nas-Dos
software available in DCS-Dos 2 format for those users retaining
DCS-Dos. This may not prove possible and such software will only
be available to special order at an additional charge of 5
pounds per software package. If you need such software ask your
dealer to contact us.
