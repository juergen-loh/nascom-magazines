For those of you who are wondering fram the intraduction
what DCS-Dow in, we will explain. For) these of you whe own
DES-bow please read on, there are some comments here directed
specifically at you
</p>
<p>
DES-Dos tn a disc operating system which was originally
developed by Steve Parrish of Dave Computer Services for use
with the old Geert disc drives connected to the Nascom via the
Henelec cantraller and the PIO. A much improved version of this
dec operating system became Nas-Dos for use with the Nascom
disc drives and the Nascom Floppy Disc Controller card. Steve
has now upgraded the original DCS-Dos to DCS-Dos 2, which is
generally simlar to Nas-Dos but still for use with disc drives
fitted with the old Henelec controller connected via the PIO.
</p>
<p>
To DCS-Dos owners we Would like to suggest that you consider
changing to Nascom discs and the FOC board. This will give you
the following advantage:
</p>
<p>
Double disc capacity (quadruple if you ge for the double-sided
drives)
</p>
<p>
Media compatibility
</p>
<p>
Access to all standard Nas-Dos software
</p>
<p>
The obvious prablem is that you wil need to buy new disc
drives and the controller card. As we have already&rdquo; mentioned,
there 12 a special offer on until the end of November so if you
are considering a change, now would be a good time. We regret
that, as we had no involvement with the sale of the origsnal
drives, we are unable to make any other additional offer
Durselves with respect to your existing disc hardware. Homevery
we have agreed with DCS that if you send us your DCS-Dos chaps
te will upgrade these to Nas-Dos for a charge of only 10 pounds.
This software swap should be done through ourselves rather. than
dealers in order that the serialising and registration can Be
performed correctly and the original DCS-Dos registration can be
Eancel led.
</p>
<p>
We are looking inte the possibility of making some Nas-Dow
software available in DCS-Dos 2 format for those users retaining
DCS-Dos. This may not prove possible and such software will only:
be avatiable to special order at an additional charge of 5
pounds per software package: If you need such software ask your
Sealer ta contact. us.

onnera via DOS. If, as 4 DCS-Dos omner, you want to be put on
our mailing Iist then please write to me giving your&rdquo; name,
