Just as in the standard monitors, the W)rite command
requires the start address and the one-after-the-finish address.
However, a third argument is needed by HOBBIT, the address at
which execution takes place. For when a program is R)ead, it
executes from the specified address. If execution is not wanted,
or if a file in required to be read to a different address than
its logical one, then it can be L)oaded down to anywhere on
supplying the L command with a single argument.

The two final commands go a long way to support standard
NASCOM software, whether it is an EPROM or RAM-based. The &ldquo;Z&rdquo;
command requires two arguments. The first is the address of the
start of a file, where that address holds the length of the
file. The second argument is the execution address. For example,
if you have ZEAP in EPROM, then Z 1000 D003 would store the
source code and when R)ead would warm start ZEAP. Similarly, for
NASPEN, Z 101A B806 would do the same. The &ldquo;B&rdquo; command also
requires two arguments, but in this case the first one is the
address of the first byte of the tile which also holds the
address of the end of file plus one. Microsoft BASIC files are
of this nature, for the ROM version B 10D6 FFFD saves the
program. The RAM versions of both ZEAP and BASIC are thus also
supported, if you know their relevant addresses.

There are 6 error traps in the system. They are indicated
only by a single letter, but 6 are not too difficult to
remember. The errors indicated are:&ndash;
</p>
<dl class="indent2 justify">
<dt>A</dt><dd>Filename already exists</dd>
<dt>B</dt><dd>Bad file structure, ie. your program</dd>
<dt>C</dt><dd>Hard read error</dd>
<dt>D</dt><dd>Tape full</dd>
<dt>E</dt><dd>A file of that name does not exist</dd>
<dt>G</dt><dd>Cassette write protected</dd>
</dl>
<p>
To date I&rsquo;ve had no hard read errors, in fact the system
appears to read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>write perfectly, with no errors at all.
</p>
<p>
The documentation also explains the function of the major
routines in the software, together with their addresses, so that
they can be called by your own machine code routines or
programs. It is a pity that the original source code is not
available (ie. for sale) as there is obviously a certain amount
of redundancy in the operating system due to its wide support of
all monitors and speeds, and other things, like the directory
could do with altering.

Actually, I can understand the author&rsquo;s reluctance to
release his source code. The Philips <?php externalLink("MDCR-Manual","Mini-DCR"); ?> requires
phase encoded data and, as far as I am aware, all previous
designs have accomplished this in hardware. Dave Tucker has
managed to perform this in software, which is why the interface
is so simple, and presumably why the system has been kept so
