dust as in the Stendacd goniture, the Woeate command
requires the start address and the one-alter-the-Finish address.
Honever, a third argument is needed by HOBBIT, the address at
which execution takes place. For when a pragram is Read, it
cxecutes from the specified address. If emecution ts not wanted,
or if a tile in required to be read to a different address than
its logical one, then it can be Loaded down to anywhere on
supplying the I command with a single argument.

The two final commands 99 a long way te support standard
NASCOM software, whether it is an EPROM or RAM-based. The &ldquo;Z)
command requires two arguments. The first is the address of the
start of a file, where that address helds the length of the
file. The second argument 12 the execution address. For example,
Af you have ZEAP in EPROM, then 7 1000 DUGS would store the
source code and when Read would warm start ZEAP. Similarly, for
NASPEN, 7 ID1A 8808 Would do the same the &ldquo;B&rdquo; command. also
requires two arguments, but in this case the first one ts the
address of the rst byte of the tile which also holds the
Address of the end of file plus one. Merosoft BASIC files are
OF this nature, for the ROM version &amp; 10D8 FFFD saves the
Program. The RAM versions of both ZEAP and RASIC are thus also
Supported, :f you know their relevant addresues.

The documentation also explains the function of the mayor
routines in the software, together with their addresses, so that
they can be called by your ow machine Code routines or
programs. It is a pity that the original source code as. nat

Actually, 1 can understand the author s reluctance to
release Ne) source code. The Philips Mini-DCR requires
phase encoded data and, ae far as I am aware, all previous,
Hesigns have accomplished this in hardware. Dave Tucker has
managed to perform (his in software, which ie why the interface
Te so simple, and presumably why the systea has been kept so
