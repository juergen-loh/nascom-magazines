MANOR
</h3>
<p>
Modesty prevents me extolling the virtues of Manor at any
great length, suffice to say, it is an extremely versatile data
management system which no Nas-Dos owner (or DCS-Dos owner) can
afford to be without! Again, applications are almost unlimited
but includes:

<p class="indent">
Cataloguing (records, books, discs, etc)<br>
Customer records<br>
Drawing files<br>
Exhibition enquiries<br>
Hire records<br>
Maintenance schedules and records<br>
Parts lists<br>
Personnel records<br>
Stock control<br>
Supplier files<br>
Tool records<br>
Warranty registration
</p>
<p>
(Software registrations are, for example, recorded using
</p>
<p>
Manor is written almost entirely in BASIC. While this does
limit speed of operation, it does mean that you can get into the
program yourself very easily if you want to modify it for more
specialised applications.

<p>
Please ask for a demonstration. We think that once you have
seen if, you will buy it. Manor is available now in disc form
and a tape version is under preparation.

WORD PROCESSING
</h3>
<p>
As mentioned in the last edition of the newsletter (Nas-Dos
not Nascom), B and L Microcomputers in Kenilworth (____ ______)
have developed some useful extensions to Naspen for the Nas-Dos
user. However, as the more perceptive reader may have realised,
we are evaluating a new word processor with many new features
which are specifically written for use with Nas-Dos. The whole of
this Newsletter (Nas-Dos not Nascom) was originally* produced
using this package. (* I am afraid that everything in the
magazine has to be churned through Wordease which makes showing
what a wordprocessor can do very difficult &ndash;Ed.) Incidentally,
typing errors in the documentation and newsletter are my fault,
not the word processor&rsquo;s! (I use the opposite argument for my
excuses &ndash; Ed.)
</p>
<p>
This new program is not yet on sale but we hope to have at
available within the next 3 months. If you come to the
exhibition you will be able to see a demonstration.
