The best definition of an optimist I had was someone who
writes programs in ink. However, since the last full stop I will
accept alternatives for &lsquo;program&rsquo; such as articles, jokes, etc.
(I had a joke somewhere when I started all this). Well, that&rsquo;s
it then, no joke, no schpeel. Unless, of course, there are any
wild and wooly chestnuts just oozing off your screens, if so;
out with your NASPENCILS and WORDEASELS, or charcoal sticks and
don&rsquo;t hide your lampoon under a NASBUS.

Our Editor (feign, fawn, bow, scrape, smirk &ndash; oops, what a
give-away) says that what we need is feedback from readers, so,
plastered about this issue (issue is or issue ain&rsquo;t) you should
find a few corns; tread carefully, they may be mine. Now you can
do better than those can&rsquo;t you? Well of course you can, so lets
hear them. To make me smile they must be short, ambiguous with
any amount of political subtlety (if you&rsquo;ll pardon the
contradiction). However, they must be vaguely electronic, not
refer to PITS or FLAT NBGBOK&rsquo;s without copious asterisks, and
not liable to libel.<br>
For instance: &lsquo;Feedback makes me sick&rsquo; and while you are
digesting that, howsabout &lsquo;Parallel digital processing &ndash; both
hands&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Commercial examples of humour do exist &ndash; anyone remember
Mike Rose? (would I invent him?), while for those whose discs,
are a status symbol need Q-DOS and any day now I am expecting a
golf program called NASTEE. Until, dear readers, one of you can
better the pun, I shall refer to these as IN jokes (value
measured in DB&rsquo;s of course). As the corn is grinding to a halt,
instead of flowering, perhaps I should leave you with an
anecdote about a colleague we shall recognise by the misnomer &ndash;
our man Ager.
</p>
<p>
Whilst debugging the mechanics of a system he was reading
out the CPU registers. Much to his credit, this man Ager waited
patiently for the right moment to exclaim &lsquo;There&rsquo;s OF in L&rsquo;; was
my man ever so plussed? All I could manage was a half-thrust,
crass-parry without whip like: &lsquo;A bit OE&rsquo;. Rotherham was proud
of him that day but too ashamed of him otherwise to admit it.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I am forming a personal collection of Pig jokes,
please contribute generously. What? Well, its a long story but
if I told you the P.M. of N.Z. was effectionately known as Piggy
Muldoon, you are knocking on for experts in Kiwi politics.
</p>
<p>
Lets hear it for the joke party, remember, much is groan
from A corn. Keep &rsquo;em klean.
