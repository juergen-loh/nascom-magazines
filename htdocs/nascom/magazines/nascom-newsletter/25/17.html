<u>The Competition</u>
</h2>
<p>
Microcode, in conjunction with Micro Power, are offering the
readers of the Nascom Newsletter the chance to see their pet
hardware idea incorporated into a marketable product. Most
Nascom enthusiasts have some pet project that they would like to
see on the market. This is your chance to make that dream come
true. Ideas submitted may consist of anything from a scribbled
note to a fully working prototype. You do not need to be an
electronic whizz kid to enter. ALL you need to submit is your
idea, whether it is for a 65 bit processor or a 256 colour video
card, anything goes. Obviously, the more detail you give us, the
better your winning chances in the case of a draw. The only
necessity is that the idea is Nas-bus/80-bus compatible.
</p>
<p>
The competition will be judged by Micro Power, Microcode and
an independent judge, and the prizes will be awarded to the most
ingenious and of original designs.
