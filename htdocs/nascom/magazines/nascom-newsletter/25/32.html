Not suprisingly after this period of time, there are no
reports of any problems mith Nas-Dos itself other than the
Occaissional failure to determine the top of memory correctly
(see Nas-Dos News, Issue 1, for details).
</p>
<p>
It has been pointed out by ane user who has Nae-xys 1 that.
the instructions provided wath the Nas-Dos utilities package
specify incorrectly the byte to be changed for use with Nas-aye
1. As I know that several different versions of the utilities
have been Issued Ot 15 a development package) the best solution
12 to look at the enclosed listing of the relevant section of
the utilities and make the change shown when you have found out
hhich byte if tr which qeeds changing tm your copy. The byte
Should be within &amp; bytes af the position&rdquo; shown. Sorry about
this, but as explained, this is a developement package provided
free rather than an integral part of Nas-Dos and, as i never run
Nas-sys I, the nead ta record the change of this byte keeps
getting overlooked. If you come to the exhibition that we are
Sttending on 3 day on which I&rsquo;am on the stand, and you havea
disc mth you, I will make sure you have a copy of &lsquo;the latest
edition of the utilities.

nas pos 1.2
Rev 1.2 of Nas-Dos 15 now being relwaned. However, as
mentioned in the last issue, the changes from 1-1 are very minor
MEorrect detection of top of memory, faster seck times and fle
arite protection factlity (using a new utility program). If you
Feally feel you need these changes then send &ldquo;us your existing
Nac-Dos chips and utilities dise, together mith a cheque far 10
pounds, and we will send you back Rev 1-2 &ldquo;and the additional
kitty program, Note that this 15 an upgrade service: you wll
Stl Only awn a single copy of Nas-bos (mith the original
Serial number) which must only be used on a single machine
</p>
<p>
One important cautionary note: the improved seek speed will
work only mith later dist drives with metal side plates. If you
Bttempt to use Rev 1-2 with older&rdquo; plastic sided). drives you
tall get disc access errors. If your drives have a norizontally
mounted trimpot in the centre of the board mounted aver the
drive, you should be able to adjust this to get satisfactory
results. Unfortunately, ane batch of drives was supplied by the
drive manufacturer with fixed resistors in this position and in
this case you can not run Rev 1-2 You have my deepest sympathy
</p>
<p>
I too baught ane of this batch of drives; which ts how I
discovered the problem.
