CLANGERS

<p>
Not suprisingly after this period of time, there are no
reports of any problems with Nas-Dos itself other than the
occaissional failure to determine the top of memory correctly
(see Nas-Dos News, <a href="../text/"></a>Issue&nbsp;1, for details).
</p>
<p>
It has been pointed out by one user who has Nas-sys&nbsp;1 that
the instructions provided with the Nas-Dos utilities package
specify incorrectly the byte to be changed for use with Nas-sys&nbsp;1.
As I know that several different versions of the utilities
have been issued (it is a development package) the best solution
is to look at the enclosed listing of the relevant section of
the utilities and make the change shown when you have found out
which byte it is which needs changing in your copy. The byte
should be within 6 bytes of the position shown. Sorry about
this, but as explained, this is a developement package provided
free rather than an integral part of Nas-Dos and, as I never run
Nas-sys&nbsp;1, the need to record the change of this byte keeps
getting overlooked. If you come to the exhibition that we are
attending on a day on which I am on the stand, and you have a
disc with you, I will make sure you have a copy of the latest
edition of the utilities.

NAS-DOS 1.2
</h3>
<p>
Rev 1.2 of Nas-Dos is now being released. However, as
mentioned in the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue, the changes from 1.1 are very minor
&ndash; correct detection of top of memory, faster seek times and file
write protection facility (using a new utility program). If you
really feel you need these changes then send us your existing
Nas-Dos chips and utilities disc, together with a cheque for 10
pounds, and we will send you back Rev 1.2 and the additional
utility program. Note that this is an upgrade service; you will
still only own a single copy of Nas-Dos (with the original
serial number) which must only be used on a single machine.
</p>
<p>
One important cautionary note: the improved seek speed will
work only with later disk drives with metal side plates. If you
attempt to use Rev 1.2 with older (plastic sided) drives you
will get disc access errors. If your drives have a horizontally
mounted trimpot in the centre of the board mounted over the
drive, you should be able to adjust this to get satisfactory
results. Unfortunately, one batch of drives was supplied by the
drive manufacturer with fixed resistors in this position and in
this case you can not run Rev 1.2. You have my deepest sympathy
&ndash; I too bought one of this batch of drives; which is how I
discovered the problem.

Nas-Sembler is the new disc-based assembler for the Nascom
with Nas-Dos. Some of the highlights are:
