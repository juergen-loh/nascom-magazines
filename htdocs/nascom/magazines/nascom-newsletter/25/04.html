BC? must be saved somewhere in RAM, I leave its actual
positron up to you, call 18 BCSAVE. Do not get this variable
corrupted!
</p>
<p>
If you remember, when an IX of IY are used with a
displacement, the displacement is always the third byte oF an
insteuction. BC&rdquo; weil get altered but the print routine will
Still need to know thos third byte, Get a copy of the first byte
Of the ap-code into the A register, Do not alter BC&rsquo; &ndash; ite
Useful life is nat over yee.

<p>
This part will test your knowledge of 760 shifts and other
bit-wise Operations. Split A into 5 parts F, Gand H (nat to be
Confused with the actual register H). These variables must be
stored in memory
</p>
<p>
Fholds bite 7 (NSB) and 6
</p>
<p>
so &ldquo;5, 4 and 3) (Remember (0) eted
we * 4) 2 ana 0 ager
</p>
<p>
Te the byte was E4F &mdash;&gt; OF 001 111 then F would be 1 (Not
</p>
<p>
64), G would be 1 (Not 4) and H would be 7. Got tt? Easy wasn&rsquo;t
</p>
<p>
402&rdquo; Now to do something similar to G. G goes inta tha parts
called J and k (held in RAM). J consists of bite 2 and | af Gy
while Kis just Bit 0. For the example above --- and) K=1)
All these variables must be put somewhere safe. 1 keer
emphasising this because T kept &lsquo;corrupting my variables and
caused all sorts of things to happen!*
</p>
<p>
The next part is fundamental to the program. The print-out
routine. Call it PRDIS, print the disassembled string. I. will
define it, but you can write it.
</p>
<p>
GD No registers or variables may be altered (corrupted). You
must save them first (stack?) and restore them later
</p>
<p>
(2) The routine is a subroutine, and as such must end with a
&pound;09 RET instruction.
</p>
<p>
(3) Every INDIS in STRDIS is to be output as ML, [x4d or Ived.
Where dis the displacement (BCSAVE is used&rsquo; here). INDEX
will hold 0, 1 or 2 respectively.
</p>
<p>
(A) For every IND, print HL, IX oF IY, depending on the
contents af INDEX, as in&rsquo; (3)
</p>
<p>
(3) Tf you wish you can print the contents of BCSAVE, this
will tell you mhich location in memory the instruction
Came from. Nas-Sys is helpful here,
</p>
<p>
Check your subroutine with dumey data to test it.
</p>
<p>
Well, ali 1 can say now is best of luck and be careful with
those variables. The second part of this series will&rdquo; follow aa
the next issue.
