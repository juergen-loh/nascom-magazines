Unable to afford the givorce that would accompany the
purchase of 3 floppy disk system I had for a year or more been
Tooking for a superior alternative to the normal tape systee of
the NASCOM, Twas not after speed so much (I&rsquo;m fairly. content
with the 2400 haud/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>sero errors I get with the&rdquo; Cottia/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Blandford
tape interface on my Not) as software control of read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>write,
named programs and files and above all the ability to have true
file-handling with the standard ROM BASIC.

<p>
The Philips Mini-Digital Cassette Kecorder had caught my eye
a few times and seamed to. offer. great potentral- It has a
</p>
<p>
Ceanster&rdquo; speed of 6000 baud, uses digitaliy-certitied
mint-Cassettens, is about ains cube in size and has a very good
fame in industry for relsapility and low error rates ithe
</p>
<p>
irrecoverable error rate rs quoted as 1 in 10 to the power 9- a
thousand tises better than floppy discs!)

<p>
The only company that originally produced a fll working
system sermed to be Currah, but onty for 650? based systema. The
basic cost of just the Mint -DOR was about &pound;90, but this. Newded
an interface and control software. I felt rather daunted by this.
task and so for a while gave up the dea, uaing vartous Software
patches ta try and overcome the inherent drawbacks of the
Standard tape system.

Thay almost szmuttaneously two Min &mdash;DCR systems appeared for
the NASCOM. &ldquo;One By C.J Esl of Edenturgh, the other by&rdquo; Grange
Electromes of Maborne in Durset. Both appeared to be fairly
close to what I was after except for tho thingss
TD price they&rsquo;re both about &pound;200
2) neither have File-handling extensions for BASIC, just the
ability to Store named programs.

<p>
Then about tw months ago an advert appeared in PCW offering
a system for Nascoms for an incredible &pound;99 plus Maggre&rsquo;s bit. So
Stee ringing the firm, IKON COMPUTER PRODUCTS and spealiag to @
Very friendly Dave tucker, the owner, I ordered ane.

Wnat you get for the money is a Mini-DEK mired to a very
simple I-chip-and-a-fewresrstors Interface, 2 2708&rsquo;s with the
Control software and a cassette. Also a small but adequate
instruction manual. A case 15 avaifable au an extra, though as
far asl know 1t will only take one drive.&rdquo; Connerion (British
Telecom standard Spelling-Honest&rsquo;) 16 very simple. Tt requires,
120mA @ +12v and Toma # #5v, so can eautly be driven by any
existing PSU. Control i= via one port of the PIU. two OCKu can
