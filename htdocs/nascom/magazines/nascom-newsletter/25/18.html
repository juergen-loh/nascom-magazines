or, a Review of IKON&rsquo; &ldquo;Hobbit&rdquo;,<br>
a Mini-Digital Cassette system for Nascoms

Unable to afford the divorce that would accompany the
purchase of a floppy disk system I had for a year or more been
looking for a superior alternative to the normal tape system of
the NASCOM. I was not after speed so much (I&rsquo;m fairly content
with the 2400&nbsp;baud/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>zero errors I get with the Cottis/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Blandford
tape interface on my N-1) as software control of read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>write,
named programs and files and above all the ability to have true
file-handling with the standard ROM BASIC.
</p>
<p>
The Philips Mini-Digital Cassette Recorder had caught my eye
a few times and seamed to offer great potential. It has a
transfer speed of 6000&nbsp;baud, uses digitally-certified
mini-cassettes, is about 4ins cube in size and has a very good
name in industry for reliability and low error rates (the
irrecoverable error rate is quoted as 1 in 10 to the power 9- a
thousand times better than floppy discs!)
</p>
<p>
The only company that originally produced a full working
system seemed to be Currah, but only for 6502 based systems. The
basic cost of just the Mini-DCR was about &pound;90, but this needed
an interface and control software. I felt rather daunted by this
task and so for a while gave up the idea, using various software
patches to try and overcome the inherent drawbacks of the
standard tape system.

<p>
Then almost simultaneously two Mini-DCR systems appeared for
the NASCOM. One by C.I.E.L. of Edinburgh, the other by Grange
Electronics of Nimborne in Dorset. Both appeared to be fairly
close to what I was after except for two things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>price- they&rsquo;re both about &pound;200</li>
<li>neither have file-handling extensions for BASIC, just the
ability to store named programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Then about two months ago an advert appeared in PCW offering
a system for Nascoms for an incredible &pound;99 plus Maggie&rsquo;s bit. So
after ringing the firm, IKON COMPUTER PRODUCTS and speaking to a
very friendly Dave Tucker, the owner, I ordered one.

<p>
What you get for the money is a Mini-DCR wired to a very
simple 1-chip-and-a-few-resistors interface, 2 2708&rsquo;s with the
control software and a cassette. Also a small but adequate
instruction manual. A case is available as an extra, though as
far as I know it will only take one drive. Connexion (British
Telecom standard spelling-Honest!) is very simple. It requires
120mA @ +12v and 10ma @ +5v, so can easily be driven by any
existing PSU. Control is via one port of the PIO. Two DCRs can
