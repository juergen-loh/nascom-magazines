be connected, the second using the other port. The standard
EPROMs are addressed at D000), though other addressee can be
supplied. If you&rsquo;re running at 4Meg a wait state has to be
inserted.
</p>
<p>
To enter the <span class="uppercase">Hobbit Monitor</span>, as its called, type ED000 x y,
where x is a 1 for T2, T4 or T-Bug, or 0 for Nas-Sys, and y is 1
for 2Meg and 0 for 4Meg clock speeds. So all monitors are
supported. On execution HOBBIT tests the extent of RAM and takes
the top 1.5k for its buffer and tape directory (or 3k for 2
drives). So if BAGIC is initialised ensure you answer its &ldquo;SIZE&rdquo;
question and don&rsquo;t just press Newline, or the directory and
buffer will be overwritten.
</p>
<p>
As supplied the <?php externalLink("MDCR-Manual","DCR"); ?> monitor has 15 commands, the first, like
disks, being FORMAT, called, as are all commands by the first
letter of the command name, ie. in this case &ldquo;F&rdquo;. All new
cassettes need formatting, and like disks, this will destroy any
previously recorded data if you accidently format a used tape.
</p>
<p>
Each tape, when loaded into the DCR, has to be M)ounted.
This transfers the directory to RAM. This is perhaps the most
frustrating command as it takes so long &ndash; up to about 140
seconds. This delay is because the directory is stored in the
middle of the cassette, and a cassette must be rewound (the E)nd
command) before it is removed. So if you wish to use the other
side of the cassette the tape has to be completely rewound
(though it is done automatically) which takes about 95 seconds
and then the directory half way through has to be read, a
further 45 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Once Mounted the N)ame command lists to the screen the
names of the files on that tape. The names are listed five at a
tine down the screen, with an asterisk after each five to
indicate more, and for you to press NewLine to print them.
Finally the number of free &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; left on the tape is shown.
Each tape can hold 50.5K or up to 69 blocks (or files, if each
file is 1-block tong) per side it would be far better if the
directory was listed across the screen in groups of, say, 4
filenames
</p>
<p>
Each file name can be up to 6 characters long, with no
restrictions. This is a little short as you really need at least
6 characters for a name, with perhaps a further 4 for a
description, eg. S/TREK.BAS or Hobbit.M/C
</p>
<p>
The K)ill command deletes all the files on one side of the
cassette, whilst D)elete purges just one specified file. C)hange
alters a file name. This is one Command I thought I&rsquo;d never use,
but it&rsquo;s surprising how useful it&rsquo;s become. S)elect and
T)ransfer are used with a 2-drive set-up and are
self explanatory. The X)it, ie EXIT, command returns to the
standard <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> monitor via MRET.
