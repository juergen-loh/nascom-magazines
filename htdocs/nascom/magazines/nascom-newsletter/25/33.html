Nas-Sembler is available NOW with the Z80 assembler. There
are also cross-assemblers to allow you to prepare programs for
<?php externalLink("6502"); ?> and 6800 microprocessors and we hope to have a
cross-assembler for the Motorola 68000 very soon.
</p>
<p>
Please read the spec. sheet for more details, or better
still, ask your dealer for a demonstration, or come and see us
at the exhibition.

<p>
ZEAP will continue to be available for both disc and tape
users.

NAS-CALC 1
</h3>
<p>
Nas-Calc is a computerised spread sheet which allows you to
create a &lsquo;sheet&rsquo; of rows and columns of data on the screen.
These can be edited, stored and printed. A wide range of
mathematical relationships can be specified allowing, for
example in the simplest case for automatic calculation of the
sum totals of the respective columns. Up to 99 rows and 99
columns of data can be manipulated.
</p>
<p>
Nas-Calc is so versatile it is difficult to know where to
start in suggesting applications but these include:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Balance sheet analysis<br>
Costing<br>
Delivery schedules<br>
Fixed asset register<br>
Forecasting<br>
Investment appraisal<br>
Parts lists<br>
Personnel records<br>
Price lists<br>
Salary data<br>
Sales planning<br>
Scheduling<br>
Tax returns
</p>
<p>
Nas-Calc is already on sale. Again we suggest you look at
the data sheet and then see a demonstration at your dealers or
at an exhibition.
