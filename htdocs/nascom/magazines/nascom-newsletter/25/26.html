Nasprint 80 is a printer drive and formatting package for
use with the Epson MX80 series of printers, although it can be
used with other printers. Details of interfacing are included in
the manual. The package runs under Nas-sys&nbsp;1 or Nas-sys&nbsp;3. I was
lucky enough to be given a pre-release version for evaluation
purposes. There now follows my review of this invaluable piece
of software.
</p>
<p>
Nasprint 80 is a 2K package supplied in 2x<?php externalLink("2708"); ?> or 1x<?php externalLink("2716"); ?>
EPROM. It is located at B000H in the Nascom memory map so it
resides just below Naspen. The package can be purchased for
&pound;12.95 from Program Power. Apart from the EPROM, a comprehensive
23 page manual is included. This contains full information about
the operation of Nasprint. Nasprint has been designed to operate
with all the standard Nascom packages; Debug, Nasdis, Nas-sys,
Naspen and Zeap.

<p>
There are two modes of initialisation, a cold start at B000H
and a warm start at B003H. When initialised, a list of options
appears on the screen. These allow the software package which is
to be used to be selected. Various options can then be specified
if required. These are:

<p class="noindent">
C&nbsp;&ndash; centre the title<br>
D&nbsp;&ndash; print dividers between pages (for seperating pages when
	using roll paper)<br>
F&nbsp;&ndash; modify format (see later)<br>
N&nbsp;&ndash; page number<br>
O&nbsp;&ndash; output codes (allows you to output Hex codes directly to the
	printer)<br>
P&nbsp;&ndash; paginated (divides the output into pages)<br>
T&nbsp;&ndash; title (prints a user defined title at the top of each
	page.
</p>
<p>
The format option allows the exact layout of each page to be
specified. This is done in a very neat and easy way. A list of
parameters followed by their current values is displayed on the
screen. By moving the cursor around and modifying the relevant
values, the printer output format can be changed. The number of
line feeds, page Length, line Length, margin length and first
page number can all be modified in this way. The spaces for the
page number, title and between the top of the page, title, page
number and bottom of the page can all be specified as well.

<p>
At thin stage, all of the Nasprint options have been
specified so program execution continues under whichever package
was selected. With Nas-sys, Nasdis and Debug, everything typed
at the keyboard is output to the printer (unless the printer is
