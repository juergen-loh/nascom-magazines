disabled with the Nas-sys &lsquo;N&rsquo; command). If the relevant options
are set, the printed output will now appear with a title and
incrementing page number. This produces a nice visual effect
from the program listings.

With Zeap and Naspen, everything typed at the keyboard is
not echoed to the printer. The command to print must be given
before output commences.

Nasprint is a very handy piece of software for use with
Nas-sys, Nasdis, Debug and Zeap, but it is with Naspen that it
really scores. In the days before Nasprint, I found Naspen to be
a fairly useful wordprocessor but it was impossible to utilise
all of the special print modes available on the Epson. Nasprint
changed this because it allows special printer control codes to
be embedded into the text. Codes between &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; are
intercepted by Nasprint and are not sent directly to the
printer. The special codes which can be embedded in the Naspen
source text are:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>C</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>centre the line</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>double line spacing</td></tr>
<tr><td>H</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>hold (stops printing until any key is pressed. Useful for
	changing paper in the printer when using single sheets)</td></tr>
<tr><td>L xxx</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>changes line length to xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>M xxx</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>changes margin width to xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>N xxx</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>changes page number to xxx</td></tr>
<tr><td>O xx yy .. ..</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>Outputs Hex codes xx, yy, etc directly to the
	printer (useful for turning on/off double
	width, enhanced, condensed, etc. printing
	modes)</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>finishes off current page with spaces and starts a new
	one</td></tr>
<tr><td>S</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>sets single line spacing</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If invalid codes are used Nasprint will detect them and
print an error code.
</p>
<p>
All in all Nasprint 80 is an extremely versatile printer
facility for anyone using a Nascom and printer. Together,
Nasprint and Naspen form a really good wordprocessing package. I
have used it to print all of my letters and reports since I
installed it and have been very pleased with the results.
