be quite as expected &ndash; each EPROM location within a block will
remain at an address relative to a 16k block address, ie. a
typical 16k block would be C000 D000 E000 and F000 tor posiians:
12 5-4 respectively +f however the block address started at
B000 then they would run aa follows for 12 3 4 &ndash; Dood &pound;000 F000
&lsquo;and then B000 respectively &ndash; does that make senst

L think that is all you need to know with regard to
addressing &ndash; except that it&rdquo; is quite O.K. ta only access part
Of a page without any side effects.

MODIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE PAGING
</p>
<p>
First the bad news &ndash; you will need to buy a CMOS IC type
HCaOSS or CDAOSS ar similar (about Sop) and, if you haven&rsquo;t got
one fitted, a 24-way dil plug to save B...-.---9 OOPS, messing
Up the address selection dil socket.
</p>
<p>
With reference to Fig 2 &ndash; STICK the IC with its legs
SKYWARD So that pin 1 of the IC 1@ next to pin 24 of the dil
plug. Pins 1, 4, 6 7, &amp; @ can the be (bent) straight and
soldered directly &lsquo;to&rsquo; the dil plug as shown. The ramainder of
the connections can then be made &ndash; 1 mould suggest using THIN
single stranded wire for this job au there is NOT a LOT ROOM
and solder bridges can occur all too easily. Then wire ping 9 &amp;
10 to ICS2 pins 15 &amp; 7 respectively thece wires pick up the
latched addresses from the FF port bits 2 &amp; 3 (bit 1 turns ON or
OFF the card &ndash; hence the odd page address). Finally connect pin
16 of your I.c. to. *Sv which is conveniently available on the
Link blocks and is shown in fig 1 When using 2752 4t as
essential to use WAIT SIATES an very few if any are fast
enough to go at 4 NH without, I have therefore shown the link
Fitted.

That&rsquo;s it folks it should all happen by typing 0 FF 03 to
select page (2) 03 etc. and remember pressing reset will
select page (1) Ol. Selecting new pages will CRASH the
computer if any SUIN or SUOUT jumps &ldquo;are operating so type N
FIRST to disable them otherwise you wll have to do a RESET
anyway and you also risk SCRIBBLING UPON YOUR PROGRAMS, if in
doubt press RESET and reselect your page-

FINAL NOTES
</p>
<p>
In my onn system and that shown Gk of EPROM on page (4) 07
has been replaced by the BASIC ROM (link to Ron the dil plug)
this can be altered simply by moving that wire link to&rdquo; the
apropriate bank select- With a little ingenuity or another
BIT A LOGIC the additional EPROM locations could be paged in or
put at another address. If all this paging ts getting
Complicated &ldquo;hhy not wite a MENU program to select the pages
and start the proge for you and load them into RAM when and if
Fequired&rdquo; &ndash; I did and it took tk todo at alliiiiierer,
