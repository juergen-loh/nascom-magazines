be quite as expected&nbsp;&ndash; each EPROM location within a block will
remain at an address relative to a 16k block address, ie. a
typical 16k block would be C000 D000 E000 and F000 for positions
1 2 3 4 respectively if however the block address started at
B000 then they would run as follows for 1 2 3 4&nbsp;&ndash; D000 E000 F000
and then B000 respectively&nbsp;&ndash; does that make sense.

<p>
I think that is all you need to know with regard to
addressing&nbsp;&ndash; except that it is quite O.K. to only access part
of a page without any side effects.

Modifications To Provide Soft&shy;ware Paging
</h3>
<p>
First the bad news&nbsp;&ndash; you will need to buy a CMOS IC type
MC4053 or CD4053 or similar (about 50p) and, if you haven&rsquo;t got
one fitted, a 24-way dil plug to save B........g OOPS, messing
up the address selection dil socket.
</p>
<p>
With reference to Fig&nbsp;2&nbsp;&ndash; STICK the IC with its legs
<span class="uppercase">Skyward</span> so that pin 1 of the IC is next to pin 24 of the dil
plug. Pins 1, 4, 6, 7, &amp; 8 can the be (bent) straight and
soldered directly to the dil plug as shown. The ramainder of
the connections can then be made&nbsp;&ndash; I mould suggest using THIN
single stranded wire for this job au there is NOT a LOT ROOM
and solder bridges can occur all too easily. Then wire ping 9 &amp;
10 to IC32 pins 15 &amp; 7 respectively these wires pick up the
latched addresses from the FF port bits 2 &amp; 3 (bit 1 turns ON or
OFF the card&nbsp;&ndash; hence the odd page address). Finally connect pin
16 of your I.C. to. +5v which is conveniently available on the
link blocks and is shown in fig&nbsp;1. When using <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> it as
essential to use WAIT STATES as very few if any are fast
enough to go at 4 MHz without, I have therefore shown the link
fitted.
</p>
<p>
That&rsquo;s it folks it should all happen by typing O FF 03 to
select page (2) 03 etc. and remember pressing reset will
select page (1) 0l. Selecting new pages will CRASH the
computer if any $UIN or $UOUT jumps are operating so type N
FIRST to disable them otherwise you will have to do a RESET
anyway and you also risk <span class="uppercase">Scribbling Upon Your Programs</span>, if in
doubt press RESET and reselect your page.

Final Notes
</h3>
<p>
In my own system and that shown 8k of EPROM on page (4) 07
has been replaced by the BASIC ROM (link to R on the dil plug)
this can be altered simply by moving that wire link to the
apropriate bank select. With a little ingenuity or another
BIT A LOGIC the additional EPROM locations could be paged in or
put at another address. If all this paging is getting
complicated &ldquo;Why not write a MENU program to select the pages
and start the progs for you and load them into RAM when and if
required&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; I did and it took 1k to do it all!!!!!!!!.
