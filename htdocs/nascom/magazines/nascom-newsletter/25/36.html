AVC"s (Advanced Video Controller carde &ndash; the high resalution
colour graphics card, if anyone hasn&rsquo;t yet heard of 18) are. now
tn the shops, although demand #ar exceeds supply. Those af you
who already nave one deserve an apology. for the extremely
preliminary documentation. The documentation is now almost
Complete, and both you and new buyers will now recieve what 15,
bar some colour i!lustrations, the fimal documentation.

The results are really fantastic, and the software support
trom BASIC is, we think, going to be at least as much of a
selling point as the hardware performance. The PAL encoder has
been removed from the AVC board itself, an we were not satisfied
with the quality of result that can be obtained from a simple
Dn-board modulator. It will, unfortunately, be a few weeks
before the Seperate PA encoder board appeare. Users intending
to use anormal colour television should bear in mind that,
however good the AVC and PAL encoder, the bandwidth of colour
televisions i= restricted and resolution will therefore be
affected.

<p>
Come and see the AVC at the exhibition. If you have
technical queries, look out for Peter Horton who has dawe nearly
all the hardware and software.

NaS-NET
Nas-Net_is a very low-cost networking system which allows up
to $2 Nascoms to share @ disc under Nas-Dos. The satellites have
access to all the facilities of the Nas-Doe disc operating
System, including data file handling. Messages and programs. can
he broadcast from the &lsquo;master&rsquo; station to the satellites and the
&ldquo;master? can inspect the memory and screen contents of any
satellite. A parallel printer can be connectedta the &lsquo;master&rdquo;
and the satellites can make use of this via a spooling systen.
</p>
<p>
The satellites are connected to the &lsquo;master? via a
multiplexing unit, although, rf you just want to Link two
Nascoms, the multiplexor is/not necessary. The UART on each
satellite and the &lsquo;master&rsquo; is used for the communication system,
but, by suitable switching arrangements, the tape cassette
facilities of any of the machines can still be used in a local
mode.
</p>
<p>
Nag-Net is an exceptionally powerful system for a very low
cost. If you are looking for a networking system you need&rdquo; look
he further.

Well, that&rsquo;s the first contribution to the magazine from Nascom
themtelves. Because of the copy deadlines for the magazine (yes
we do have them) this contribution is a repeat of the latest
</p>
<p>
Nas-Dos news so some readers may have already seen it. Sorry.
The next issue should have something better organised in it,
wait and see. rac
