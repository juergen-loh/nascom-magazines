<p>
Nas-Dos News is an information sheet for users of the
Nas-Dos disc operating system an Nascom microcomputers. This,
second issue, the first for the magazine, is also being sent to
registered owners of the DCS-Dos disc operating system.
</p>
<p>
This issue has been released in time for the start of the
Autumn computing season (if there are seasons in computing!). In
particular we would like to give you news of a special offer
which should be particularly interesting for those with less
than four drives &ndash; prices are being reduced so you can afford to
buy additional drives. This offer will ONLY apply for November,
and while stocks last, and each purchase must be accompanied
with the advert from this issue of the Nascom Newsletter, so act
quickly if you want more drives. The drives are normal
production units and production will continue with the same
drives after the end of the offer period, so there are no
catches. Please mention this offer to your friends who have not
got discs yet &ndash; it is an offer you can&rsquo;t afford to miss.
</p>
<p>
We have now released new disc-based software, some of which
was mentioned in the last Nas-Dos News. We include more
information on this software later on in this Newsletter.
</p>
<p>
This is also the start of the exhibition season and we have
a stand at the Compec (Olympia) Exhibition, 16-19 November,
1982. We hope very much that you will come and visit us to see
our new products. All the new products mentioned in this
newsletter should be on display, so it should give you a chance
to see them running. Once you have seen them we are sure you
will want to buy them.
</p>
<p>
Any comments which you may have on this edition or
suggestions for future editions would be welcomed. I apologise
for the rather disjointed nature of this newsletter, but it is
all prepared in one evening &ndash; and I must admit I would rather be
writing programs than newsletters!
