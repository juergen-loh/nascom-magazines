Cheap Printout 2
</h1>
<h2>
by Mark Horsman
</h2>
<p>
While an of6 Creed 75R proved adequate for listings etc, it
mas hardly suitable for letters and reports. Therefore, seeing
an ad. in Wireless World for IBM printers, i trekked to Essex
and bought myself an old 3962 Terminal printer. I also received
with it some suggestions on interfacing. These struck me as
Somewhat crude and rather incomplete, having no software with
them. So, I set about designing my own.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the hardware. Octal buffers to switch between
characters&rsquo; and control and then 7-way Darlington drivers
(ULN2003) to drive the operating coils. The timing. contacts on
ay machine where not all c/o as per the handouts. So, they are
Just inverted as necessary and added to ARDY to generate a Busy
Signal. An enable signal for the octal buffers is. derived and
Switched with bit 7 to determine control or character. The TTL
1S powered from the Nascom ang the coils from a simple 48V ps.
The worst part is stripping out and identifying all the wiring,
then stuffing it back neatly,
</p>
<p>
Secondly, the software driver. (The nut behind the wheel).
This is based on a look up table. Mulls are returned unused. A
linefeed after a CR is also thrown away. Full stops are sent
either case to improve speed. Character case is compared with
the printer and any appropriate change sent. Finally, a routine
for printer busy is ended with a short delay which 1 found
necessary to ensure complete settling after Busy is finished.
