!</dt><dd>Terminator. The data list will be read by the MOKE
until it either finds a terminator or the end of the
Basic program text. An OD, Out of Data, error is
reported if no terminator or data is found before it
gets to the end of the program.

"</dt><dd>Repeat. Must be followed by a decimal number in the

range of 1 to 65529 (1 to 32767 and -32768 to -7).

<p>
An SN, Syntax, error will be reported if a decimal value
greater than 65529 is used as an argument to " or /. No error
will be reported for the following:
</p>
<p class="indent">
No comma after any number following " or /.<br>
A minus sign or any other character between "/ and argument.<br>
No argument!
</p>
<p>
The effect of these errors will be seen, but they will not
be catastrophic as the memory above 0C00H is protected from
&lsquo;poking&rsquo; by the MOKE.
</p>
<p>
A CRT pointer set to the first point on the screen to be
&lsquo;poked&rsquo; should be passed to the MOKE through the USR function.
After each &lsquo;poke&rsquo; the CRT pointer is incremented, bear this in
mind when calculating offsets. When the MOKE finds the
terminator, control is passed back to Basic. The CRT pointer
will be passed back set to the address of the last character
&lsquo;poked&rsquo; plus one. If the last item in the MOKE list is an
offset, the result of the calculation will be returned.
