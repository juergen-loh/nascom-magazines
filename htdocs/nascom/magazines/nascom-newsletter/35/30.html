near the mains input plug and directly in front of the tuner. On
the Tx1@ it is an the vertical panel to the right of the tuner.
</p>
<p>
Syncs from TPG on the AVC should be wired (via an isolating
capacitor) to pin @ of the socket that the 1.f. aodule plugs
into (marked as PL&amp;).
</p>
<p>
The Red, Green and Blue outputs should be wired, via
isolating capacitors) to PLIB pins 4, 3 and 2 respectively. A
supply of 5 volts should be taken from the computer via a 470R
resistor and wired to PLIG pin &amp; (pin S on the TK1O). This will
supply about 3 valts to the decoder IC and internally switch it
from video from the i.f. panel to the data inputs. Pin 1 of PLIG
is earth. These connections are shown in the diagram below.
</p>
<p>
For the few that may need their TX set to watch television
programmes, it could be arranged to switch the AVC sync and the
L.f. video output at PLA with a CHOS switch operated by the 5
volt supply from the Nasco and, together with this supply also
switching the decoder IC between video input and data inputs, an
automatic changeover from TV to computer when the computer was
Plugged in could easily be achieved.
</p>
<p>
A very important point &ndash; before any work of this type is
done, the TV set must be isolated from the matns. This not only
protects you but&rsquo; also the computer. A suitable torroidial
isolating transformer which is small enough to fit inside any
nodel can be obtained from ILP Electronics, ______ ____ _____,
_____ _____, Canterbury, Kent ___ ___. (type number 32050).
