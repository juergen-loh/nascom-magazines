NASPEN Print Routine
</h1>

<p>
This program adds several short routines to the straight
print routine that I have been using with my printer, a
Centrontes 737.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The aachine-dependent part of the routine has been put at
the end, so that if you have some other printer you can replace
the &ldquo;PRINT&rdquo; subroutine With your own. The whole program is fully
relocatable with the proviso that the two registers immediately
precede it. The FNDSTR subroutine is only in the program to make
it fully relocatable and a space has been left so that @C82 to
ces can be replaced by 21 YY Xx, where XXYY is the address of
the first register.
</p>
<p>
If the FNDSTR subroutine is removed then all relative calls
to the PRINT subroutine will nedd to be recalculated. For those
of you not familiar with machine code, the Ni Sar command
canbe used. For example, the new address of PRINT would be
@CED. To calculate the new RCALZ enter &lsquo;A CBD @CED&rsquo;. On the
next Jine would appear &ldquo;197A 060 SE&rdquo;. The last figure is the
relative jum so 65H at CBE would be replaced by SEH.
</p>
<p>
One minor fault with the relative call is that it is
unconditional so two further bytes can be saved in lines 57 to
59 and 62 to 64 by replacing the two instructions with &lsquo;CALL
NZ,LFOUT&rsquo;. The high nibble of the first register is used as a
flag register with the low nibble as a store for the number of
spaces to be printed in a margin.
</p>
<p>
The first flag (bit 4) is set after a CR. The Centronics
printer uses a CR as a print instruction, with a LF being output
only if there are other characters in the print buffer. If ther
are consecutive CRs then the subsequent ones will be ignored by
the printer and so the check is made of the flag and, if set, a
LF followed by a CR is output. The CR is output in case the
following line has @@ characters, in which case there would be
an overflow of the buffer. and the last character mould be
printed on the following line.
</p>
<p>
The second flag (bit 5) is checked after a CR to see if
double spacing is required. If so, LF followed by a CR is
putput.
</p>
<p>
The third flag (it 6) is also checked after each CR. If it
is set then a margin of up to 15 spaces is printed, the Aumber
being stored in the lower nibble of the register. This is
obtained in line &amp;8 where the AND instruction is used to delete
the high nibble. A check ts made that a umber has been entered
or the pointer will print a margin of 255 spaces wide. At this
point the CR flag is reset as if would cause an extra LF to be
