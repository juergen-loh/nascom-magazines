NASPEN Print Routine

<p>
This program adds several short routines to the straight
print routine that I have been using with my printer, a
Centronics 737.
</p>
<p>
The machine-dependent part of the routine has been put at
the end, so that if you have some other printer you can replace
the &lsquo;PRINT&rsquo; subroutine with your own. The whole program is fully
relocatable with the proviso that the two registers immediately
precede it. The FNDSTR subroutine is only in the program to make
it fully relocatable and a space has been left so that 0C82 to
0C84 can be replaced by 21 YY XX, where XXYY is the address of
the first register.
</p>
<p>
If the FNDSTR subroutine is removed then all relative calls
to the PRINT subroutine will nedd to be recalculated. For those
of you not familiar with machine code, the Nas-Sys &lsquo;A&rsquo; command
can be used. For example, the new address of PRINT would be
0CED. To calculate the new RCAL2 enter &lsquo;A 0C8D 0CED&rsquo;. On the
next line would appear &lsquo;197A 0060 5E&rsquo;. The last figure is the
relative jump so 65H at 0C8E would be replaced by 5EH.
</p>
<p>
One minor fault with the relative call is that it is
unconditional so two further bytes can be saved in lines 57 to
59 and 62 to 64 by replacing the two instructions with &lsquo;CALL
NZ,LFOUT&rsquo;. The high nibble of the first register is used as a
flag register with the low nibble as a store for the number of
spaces to be printed in a margin.
</p>
<p>
The first flag (bit 4) is set after a CR. The Centronics
printer uses a CR as a print instruction, with a LF being output
only if there are other characters in the print buffer. If ther
are consecutive CRs then the subsequent ones will be ignored by
the printer and so the check is made of the flag and, if set, a
LF followed by a CR is output. The CR is output in case the
following line has 80 characters, in which case there would be
an overflow of the buffer and the last character would be
printed on the following line.
</p>
<p>
The second flag (bit 5) is checked after a CR to see if
double spacing is required. If so, LF followed by a CR is
output.
</p>
<p>
The third flag (bit 6) is also checked after each CR. If it
is set then a margin of up to 15 spaces is printed, the number
being stored in the lower nibble of the register. This is
obtained in line 68 where the AND instruction is used to delete
the high nibble. A check is made that a umber has been entered
or the pointer will print a margin of 255 spaces wide. At this
point the CR flag is reset as if would cause an extra LF to be
