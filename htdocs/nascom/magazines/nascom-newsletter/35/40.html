There are, no doubt, many people reading this article who do
their programming using an assembler. There is a possiblity that
there are some who can write without having to move blocks of
source code around. There is even a possiblity that some write
comments on each line of code that they write, as they write it.
For those of you who are bad programmers, like me, the following
two programs may be of some use.
</p>
<p>
Although these programs are written for the V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T assembler,
I am sure that they can easily be adapted to work with ZEAP. The
differences are, I believe, that the ZEAP source code starts
several bytes after the start of its file address and uses a
null instead of 1FH as its end of line marker.

<p>
The first is a short program that copies the source code of
a V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T assembler to a Naspen File.
</p>
<p>
First cold start Naspen and leave it then, to start the
program type E D00 XXXK YYYY where XXXX is the start of the
source code and YYYY is the end of it, taken from the top line
of the screen. The first check is that the correct number of
