Secondary Uses for the Lucas AVC Graphics Card
</h1>
<h2>
by Stan. Gent

<p>
The Lucas Advanced Video Controller provides an easily used,
moderately high-definition colour graphics facility on the
Nastom range of computers.
</p>
<p>
However, I have seen no mention of the fact that it can also
provide a very useful addition to the memory capacity of the
Machine in non-graphical applications, by virtue of the fact
that the board contains 48 kilo-bytes of dynamic RAM, arranged
in&rsquo;3 pages of 18K each.
</p>
<p>
These three pages are all located at the same address
(normally B0@0H &ldquo;to. BFFFH, although there is provision for
changicg this by means of Rard-wired links). Page selection is
Via port B2, but only operates after execution of the AVC
Control software (G32&rsquo;or G48). As the execution of G32 or G48
Seems to require the prior initialigation of Basic, aven if all
subsequent work is to be in machine code, it 25 also a wise
Precaution to set the Basic memory ceiling below goveH. The
Fesponse &ldquo;32767&rdquo; or less to the question &ldquo;Memory size?&rdquo; will
achieve this.

<p>
Sys, the keyboard command
</p>
<p>
Using Nat
pez
</p>
<p>
will select page 1 (normally the red page),
O22
</p>
<p>
wi11 select page 2 (green? and
oes
</p>
<p>
will select page 3 (blue), all of which are 16K long.
</p>
<p>
14 the Nascom also has its narmal RAM extending over the
sane address area, 0 B2 0 will select the normal RAM, giving, in
effect, a choice of 4 separate pages of {4K each, in the
TacatiGn 8009 to BFFFH.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, the page selection can also be carried out within
a program, and it is here that the full benefit can be realised.
Listing 1 shows one way of achieving this in machine code
wnadsty in Basic, only a single-line instruction is required as
</p>
<p>
Tn listing 2. (If using Basic, the memory ceiling limitation
referred to earlier should not be applied.)
</p>
<p>
Dont forget, of course, that if your control program is in
the area of memory that you have just paged out, even&rdquo; a Nascom
