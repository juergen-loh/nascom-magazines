&lsquo;The Basic interpreter must be modified if = genuine INKEY
function is required. The Microsoft Basic that the Nascom uses
was adapted from a program written in 6080 mathine code. The
BeGe doesn&rsquo;t have an &ldquo;IN r,(C)* instruction, so a small skeleton
Subroutine is used instead: The subroutine looks like thist

&lsquo;This resides in RAM, as can be seen from the addresses. If
DBH is changed to DFH, a Nas-Sys RST SCAL will be executed. The
monitor subroutine called being dependent on the nunber passed
by the INPQ function. Any subroutine that doesn&rsquo;t require an

<p>
Line 30 is required when using SCAL IN as this routine returns
values greater than 128 when no key is pressed.

Well, you now have no excuse for ever being a USR again! The
two ways of detecting a key press from Basic are so incredibly
obvious, T cant imagine why no one else has ever thought of
then before!
