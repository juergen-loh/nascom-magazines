When all that is required is for the program to wait until
Enter or Newline is pressed, you only need the following line&nsbp:
</p>
<p class="center">
10 IF INP(0) AND 2 THEN 10
</p>
<p class="continued">
This will loop until Enter is pressed.
</p>
<h4>
&hellip; and a naughty way.

<p>
The Basic interpreter must be modified if a genuine INKEY
function is required. The Microsoft Basic that the Nascom uses
was adapted from a program written in <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> machine code. The
8080 doesn&rsquo;t have an &lsquo;IN r,(C)&rsquo; instruction, so a small skeleton
subroutine is used instead. The subroutine looks like this:
</p>
<p class="indent">
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-55-2.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
This resides in RAM, as can be seen from the addresses. If
DBH is changed to DFH, a Nas-Sys RST SCAL will be executed. The
monitor subroutine called being dependent on the number passed
by the INP() function. Any subroutine that doesn&rsquo;t require an
argument can be used. The useful routines and their numbers
are:
</p>
<p class="indent">
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-55-3.png"); ?>
</p>
<h4>
Example
</h4>
<p class="indent">
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-55-4.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
Line 30 is required when using SCAL IN as this routine returns
values greater than 128 when no key is pressed.
</p>
<p>
Well, you now have no excuse for ever being a USR again! The
two ways of detecting a key press from Basic are so incredibly
obvious, I can&rsquo;t imagine why no one else has ever thought of
then before!
