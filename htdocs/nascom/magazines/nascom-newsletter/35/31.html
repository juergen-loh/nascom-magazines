Smarten up those Basic Listings&nbsp;!
</h1>

<p>
The following machine code routine enables Basic programs to
be listed with indented FOR-NEXT loops, considerably clarifying
program structure.
</p>
<p>
The example shows that a Basic program may be listed in the
normal way, and by leaving Basic via the <span class="uppercase">Monitor</span> command and
executing the indent routine at 0C80H (EC80), an indented
listing is produced clearly showing the program structure.
</p>
<h3>
Notes.
</h3>
<ol class="number-dot justify">
<li>
The routine is fully relocatable.
</li>
<li>
The routine may be interupted using ESC, and the number of
lines displayed may be set by the LINES command as usual.
</li>
<li>
The amount of indenting may be altered by changing the entry
at 0CBBH and 0CC9H.
</li>
<li>
The routine only picks up FOR and NEXT at the beginning of
lines. Messy structures like:
<br>
<p class="indent">
170 A=0 : FOR I=1 TO 10 : PRINT "*";<br>
180 NEXT I : PRINT<br>
<br>
</p>
will cause problems. The purpose of the routine is to produce
good, visually structured listings to well structured programs.
</li>
<li>
The program is written for Nascom ROM Basic Version 4.7
running under Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 but it should work with Nas-Sys&nbsp;3 as
well.
</li>
</ol>
