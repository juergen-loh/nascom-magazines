Sarten up those Basic Listings&nbsp;!
</h1>
<h2>
by D.F. Gutteridge
</h2>
<p>
The following machine code routine enables Basic prograss to
be 1isted with indented FOR-NEXT loops, considerably clarifying
program structure.
</p>
<p>
The example shows that a Basic program may be listed in the
normal way, and by leaving Basic via the MONITOR command and
</p>
<p>
executing the indent routine at @COOH (EC8e), an indented
listing is produced clearly showing the program structure.
</p>
<p>
Notes.
1. The routine is fully relocatable.
</p>
<p>
2. The routine may be interupted using ESC, and the number of
lines displayed may be set by the LINES command as usual.
</p>
<p>
3. The amount of indenting may be altered by changing the entry
at 0CBBH and ECC0H.
</p>
<p>
The routine only picks up FOR and NEXT at the beginning of
Jines. Messy structures like:
</p>
<p>
170 Aco : FOR J=1 10 10 + PRINT &rdquo;
1B NEXT T+ PRINT
</p>
<p>
Will cause problems. The purpose of the routine is to produce
good, visually structured listings to well structured programs,
</p>
<p>
5. The program is written for Nascom ROM Basic Version 4.7
running under Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 but it should work with Nas-Sys Sas
