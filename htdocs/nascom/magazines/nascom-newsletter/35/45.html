Introduction.
</h3>
<p>
This article describes the design and construction of a unit
of hardware intended to temporarily replace an EPROM during the
developement and debugging of firmware for dedicated Z80 CPU
based projects. Detail is given to allow the construction of a
unit, including an example of a loading program in Z80 assembler
code, and connections to a Nascom. The article is also intended
to act as a basis for experiment for anyone who might wisj to
extend the design.

<h3>
Design Considerations.
</h3>
<p>
My own computer interests lie in the application of
microprocessors to small design projects, often employing a Z80
CPU plus minimal RAM and EPROM configurations. A single <?php externalLink("2716"); ?>
EPROM is often enough for the whole program, ie. 2048 (2K)
bytes. A Nascom plus and EPROM programmer (such as the Gemini
one) makes quite a fair development system. However, when
testing a newly built piece of hardware (or a &lsquo;target&rsquo; system,
as it is known) it can be necessary to repeatedly blow and erase
EPROMS to find faults and debug the program. What is required is
a chunk of memory which will look like an EPROM to the target
system, but to which a host computer can read and write quickly.
This would then replace the EPROM until program development is
complete.
</p>
<p>
Several such emulators are commercially available, but tend
to be expensive, as they incorporate their own monitors,
keyboards and displays. The Nascom, though, already hay its own
powerful machine code facilities, so this design relies entirely
on the Nascom to manipulate the data, resulting in a very simple
(7 common lsTTL chips) design, at, perhaps, the cost of a little
flexibility.
</p>
<p>
The device is controlled from a Z80 <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>, in this case, ports
A and B of a Nascom&nbsp;1, although, of course, other ports may be
used.
</p>
<p>
As drawn, the emulator plugs in directly in place of the
single supply rail 2716 EPROM, although it could he extended to
<?php externalLink("2732"); ?> devices by adding extra RAM and decoding. Components are
hot critical; higher density RAM packages such as the <?php externalLink("6116"); ?> have
become available since the prototype was built and could be
worth looking at.
