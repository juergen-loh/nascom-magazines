The fourth flag (bit 7) is set if a page is to be repeated,
with the nuaber of repeats being found in the second register:
This is checkey at the end of gach page, the marker for this
being 01, which needs to be set in 1010H for the Generate
command. If @ page marker is sent to this routine then a CR is
output 2s a signal to the printer, then the GR flag is reset in
Preparation for the next page. @ check is then made for the
Fepeat flag. If it is not get then the Naspen Text and Window
pointers are set to the next page (lines 49% 50) and Naspen
ware started so that it is ready to print it when asked. If the
flag is set then the stack pointer is reset by popping its top
two registers. Then, after checking that a&rdquo; number has been
entered into the register and that the number requested has not
been printed, the program jumps ta the Naspen routine ta. repeat
the printing&rsquo; of the page.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The ather two routines not yet mentioned are the start and
finish routines. The first character to be output by Naspen is a
full. When this is received, the routine jumps to LBL6, where
the mode flags are checked. The last character is 02 and this is
converted to a CR to allow the printer to finish.
</p>
<p>
While not being a very comprehensive print rautine and
&lsquo;though the mades have to be set manually before printing, I have
found this a very useful addition and I hope that you do&rsquo; too.
