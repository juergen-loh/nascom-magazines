Editorial
</h1>
<p>
Late again, but I suppose that you&rsquo;re probably used to that
by now. Sadly, though, this will be the last issue of the
Newsletter. Due to a number of reasons including the dying
Nascom and the diminishing number of advertisers, I have been
forced to combine Volume 3, Nos 5 and 6 into one (thus the
almost twice as thick as usual edition).
</p>
<p>
This combined issue has a number of very interesting
articles (as have all the other issues of the magazine come to
that). The final part of Sysex is included, there is a very good
article on using the <?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
memory for program and data storage and
then a couple of hardware projects for an EPROM programmer and
an emulator.
</p>
<p>
I haven&rsquo;t got very much news myself. I have been using
Nassembler extensively over the last few months and can highly
recommend it. If any one has seen or knows where I can buy the
<?php externalLink("6502"); ?> and 68000 packages I would be most grateful if you could
let me know. Every where that I have contacted so far has either
denied all knowledge of them or said that they were having
supply problems.
</p>
<p>
After a discussion with Microcode, it has been decided that
the competition that we jointly sponsored last year will be
declared abandonned due to a lack of entries. My apologies to
the people that did send in their designs.
</p>
<p>
Due to demand, we can now offer our back issues at even
lower prices (25p each for issues in Volume 1 &amp; 2, or 5 for
&pound;1.00) and we still have copies of all Volume 3 (still at &pound;1.25
each I am afraid). See the back issues advert elsewhere in the
magazine. For any of you that don&rsquo;t have a full set of the
Micropower/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom Newsletter, this is probably your last chance
(and certainly your cheapest). Order now, while stocks last (or
whatever that advertising cliche is).
</p>
<p>
From the correspondence that I&rsquo;m currently getting, it seems
that the Nascom is being used for control and experimental
applications more and more but the number of hobbyist users is
dropping off rapidly. The natural life-cycle of a microcomputer
I suppose.
</p>
<p>
Well, I think that just about wraps it up for this, the
final editorial of the Micropower/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom Newsletter. My thanks
go to every one who has contributed in the past and to all the
Nascom-associated companies that have supported us with
advertising and product reviews. Best wishes to all the people
who still know that the Nascom is the best and goodbye.
