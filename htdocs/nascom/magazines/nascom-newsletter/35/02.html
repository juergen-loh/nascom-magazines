Editorial
</h1>
<p>
Late again, but I suppose that you&rsquo;re probably used to that
by now. Sadly, though, this will be the last issue of the
Newsletter. Due toa number &ldquo;af reasons including the dying
Nascom and the diminishing number of advertisers, 1 have been
forced to combine Volume 3, Nos 5 and &amp; into one (thus the
almost twice as thick as usual edition).
</p>
<p>
This combined issue has a number of very interesting
articles (as have all the other issues of the magazine come to
that). The final part of Sysex is included, there is a very good
article on using the AVC memory for program and data storage and
then a couple of hardware projects for an EPROM programmer and
an emulator.
</p>
<p>
1 haven&rsquo;t got very much news myself. I have been using
Nassembler extensively aver the last few months and can highly
recomend it. If any one has seen or knows where I can buy the
6502 and 69000 packages I mould be most grateful if you could
let me know. Every where that I have contacted so far has either
denied 211 knowledge of them or said that they were having
supply problems.
</p>
<p>
After a discussion with Microcode, it has been decided that
the competition that we jointly sponsored last year will be
declared abandonned due to a lack of entries. My &lsquo;apologies to
the people that did wend in their designs.
</p>
<p>
Due to demand, we can now offer our back issues at_ even
lower prices (25p each for issues in Volume 1% 2, or 5 for
&pound;1.00) and we still have copies of all Volume 3 (still at &pound;1.25
each I am afraid). See the back issues advert elsewhere in the
@agazine. For any of you that don&rsquo;t have 2 full set of the
Micrapower/Nascom Newsletter, this is probably your last chance
(and certaznly your cheapest). Order now, while stocks last (or
whatever that advertising cliche is)-
</p>
<p>
From the correspondence that I&rsquo;m currently getting, it seems
that the Nascom ts being used for control&rdquo; and experimental
applications more and more but the number uf nobbyist users is
dropping off rapidly. The natural life-cycle of a. microcomputer
1 suppose.
</p>
<p>
Well, T think that just about wraps it up for this, the
final editorial of the Micropower/Nascom Newsletter. My thanks
ge to every one whe has contributed in the past and to all the
Nascom-associatea companies that have supported us with
advertising and product reviews. Best wishes to all the people
Whe Still know that the Nascom is the best and goodbye.
