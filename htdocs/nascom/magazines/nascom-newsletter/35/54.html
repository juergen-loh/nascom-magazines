Doctor Knowall Remembers...

<p>
The other day, I was caught short for something to
while trying to Beat my Rubies cube retord of 45 minut
while manipulating ay cube with the right hand, I picked up
fearest thing handy... Can you quess what it was 7 No, it was
the Basic manual. I was suprised to find that basic provides no
less than 18 error messages. Of course, I had no seen any of
these in years, but I was suprised to find a function that I had
almost forgotten about&rsquo; For some reason, T couldn&rsquo;t reaeaber
&lsquo;and f doubt if anyone else has ever used POS
</p>
<p>
POS() returns the &ldquo;x&rdquo; position of the printhead and because
printers don&rsquo;t usually backspace or have full cursor movenent,
POSO will not necessarily return an &ldquo;x&rdquo; value corresponding to
the cursor position on the screen. Cursor and. printhead are
independent creatures. This can cause probless if POS is used
in input routines, but POS can be useful in output routines:
</p>
<p>
10 REM OUTPUT DATA, IN DATA LIST FORMAT
20 L=1000: REM LINE ON WHICH LIST IS TO START
</p>
<p>
3@ FOR ADDR=START To FIN STEP 2
</p>
<p>
20 IF POS(@)=0 THEN PRINT L3 &ldquo;DATA&rdquo;; :L=L+10
</p>
<p>
30 IF DEEK(ADDR)&lt;@ THEN PRINT " &ldquo;3
</p>
<p>
60 PRINT STRS(DEEK (ADDR) ) 5", "5
</p>
<p>
7e IF POS(O) &gt;40 THEN PRINT CHRS(B): REM GET RID OF LAST COMMA
80 NEXT ADDR: END
</p>
<p>
Run it, break when you have a screenful of data and enter
each DATA line displayed. Run it again if there is more data to
follow. Don?t anyone mention USR
</p>
<p>
Doctor Knowall&rsquo;s Definitive Guide to INKEYS without USRS.
</p>
<p>
USRs are people who run versions of Pascal written in Forth,
which in turn are weitten in Basic! In short, USRs don"t like
Basic. For the benefit of purists struggling) along without an
INKEY$ function, T plunge into the depths of ay immense pool of
knowledge &laquo;+. and find mot one, but tho ways of detecting single
key presses from Basic.
</p>
<p>
The guick and VERY Simple way &ndash;
</p>
<p>
If you don&rsquo;t mind using a limited range of keys, the
keyboard can be read directly from port @ using the | INPO
function. Because of timing, only the first row of keys can be
read this way. The following program shows which keys are used
and the bits that are assigned to then.
</p>
<p>
1000 KEYS &lt;@?=&rdquo; (BACKSPACE) &ldquo;
1010 KEYS.(1)=&rdquo; (ENTER)
1020 KEYS(2)="(=)&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
1050 KEVS(S)=&rdquo; (CONTROL) *
