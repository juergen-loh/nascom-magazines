The RESET and CLOCK inputs of IC&nbsp;1 are brought out to the
host computer via SKT&nbsp;1. The WRITE ENABLE (WE, active LOW)
inputs of the memory chips are connected together and also go
out to the Nascom via SKT&nbsp;1 as do the 8 data lines and the
ground connection. (Power may be obtained from the host if its
supply is adequate, although the prototype had an independent
supply. About 200mA at 5&nbsp;volt is required.)
</p>
<p>
The eight data lines are connected directly to a <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?> port on
the Nascom without an intermediate buffer. Thsi simplifies the
design but care must be taken when writing driver software: see
later.
</p>
<p>
A buffer is definitely needed between the data lines and the
target system. This function is performed by IC&nbsp;5, a further
74LS244. The data flow is of course in one direction only, out
of the emulator and into the target system. When SWITCH is HIGH
and the computer is in charge, part of IC&nbsp;3 gates off the Enable
to IC&nbsp;5 completely.
</p>
<p>
Since the standard <?php externalLink("2716"); ?> EPROM hat two select pins (chip
Select and Power Down) which both must be low to access the
EPROM, the remaining two NOR gates of IC&nbsp;6 are included to
simulate this function. Finally, capacitors Cl, C2 and C3 are
included for supply rail decoupling. One buffer in IC&nbsp;3 and two
NAND gates in IC&nbsp;7 remain spare. I thought of using one of the
gates to drive an LED to show the state of the SWITCH control
line.

<h3>
Constructing.
</h3>
<p>
Virtually any of the usual means of building circuits may be
used, the original was built on a piece of plain matrix board
about 5 inches square using hand wire-wrapping. It does not take
too long this way but care is obviously needed to avaoid wiring
errors as they are difficult to find later on. Before commencing
wiring, the two disc ceramic decoupling capacitors C2 and C3
should be fitted and connected directly to the supply pins of
ICs&nbsp;10 and 11. The supply and ground connections are then dealt
with followed by the address, data and control connections.
</p>
<p>
Connection from the Nascom to the emulator is via a 16 pin
DIL socket, SKT&nbsp;1 (shown by triangular connections on the
diagram). Connections to the target hardware are via a 24 pin
DIL socket, SKT&nbsp;2, which is wired to correspond to the pinouts
of a standard 2716 EPROM. The prototype uses a link between the
5&nbsp;volt supply and pin 24 of SKT 2. This allows the target
hardware to draw power from the emulator. Clearly, it has to be
disconnected if the target system and the emulator have their
own supplies!
</p>
<p>
The emulator is connected to the target system using a 12
inch length of ribbon cable fitted with a 24 way pin header at
each end, wired pin to pin.
