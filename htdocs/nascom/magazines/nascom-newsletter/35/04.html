SYS-EX {s warm started by executing the program efeven
(0008H) bytes on from the start. e.g. If it is installed
between 1000H and ISFFH, SYS-Ex is warm started with the NAS-SYS
command? :

A warm start is 9 useful alternative to the NAS-SYS MRET
instruction when ending an assembler program. 8.9.

There are five unused keyboard commands (gj m op) all of
which cause a routine at @400H beyond the start of SYS-EX to be
Called. Also, the two called routines USCRI and USCR2 call a
routine at 0400H beyond the start of SYS-EX. &ldquo;If suitable code
is located at this address, the commands &ldquo;a&rdquo;, "i&rdquo;, "m&rdquo;, "0",
&ldquo;p, USCRI and USCR2 may be used to call&rsquo; a further&rsquo; seven
commands, five of which are accessible directly from the
keyboard.
</p>
<p>
As SYS-EX is written in relocatable code, it is possible to
copy SYS-Ex itself into any suitable location in RAM and then to
Provide the extension commands in following RAM Locations.

<p>
Gn entry to the extension code located beyond SYS-EX, the
NAS-SYS stack is in use, Care should therefore be taken to
ensure that:
</p>
<p>
higher addresses on the stack are not corrupted
</p>
<p>
2. the maximum depth of the stack is not exceeded
</p>
<p>
3. the user code pops the same number af bytes off the stack
a5 it pushes on to it.
</p>
<p>
A return to SYS-Ek may be made by executing a Z80 RET
instruction. If the Carry flag is set upon return to SYS-EX,
the message &ldquo;Error&rdquo; is displayed on the screen prior to the
acteptance of further input.
</p>
<p>
Upon entry to the extension code, various 760 registers have
preset values. These values are as follows.
</p>
<p>
REGISTER(S) CONTENTS:
a routine number or ASCII code
HL Value from ARGL
ve value from ARG?
</p>
<p>
Bc Value from ARGS
SP OCSFH within the NAS-SYS stack
