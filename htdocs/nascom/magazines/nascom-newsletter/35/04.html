SYS-EX is warm started by executing the program eleven
(000BH) bytes on from the start. e.g. If it is installed
between 1000H and 13FFH, SYS-EX is warm started with the NAS-SYS
command:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
E 100B
</p>
<p>
A warm start is a useful alternative to the NAS-SYS MRET
instruction when ending an assembler program. e.g.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
0000 &nbsp; C3 0B B0 &nbsp; JP SYSX
</p>

<p>
There are five unused keyboard commands (g j m o p) all of
which cause a routine at 0400H beyond the start of SYS-EX to be
called. Also, the two called routines USCR1 and USCR2 call a
routine at 0400H beyond the start of SYS-EX. If suitable code
is located at this address, the commands &ldquo;g&rdquo;, &ldquo;j&rdquo;, &ldquo;m&rdquo;, &ldquo;o&rdquo;,
&ldquo;p&rdquo;, USCR1 and USCR2 may be used to call a further seven
commands, five of which are accessible directly from the
keyboard.
</p>
<p>
As SYS-EX is written in relocatable code, it is possible to
copy SYS-EX itself into any suitable location in RAM and then to
provide the extension commands in following RAM Locations.
</p>
<p>
On entry to the extension code located beyond SYS-EX, the
NAS-SYS stack is in use. Care should therefore be taken to
ensure that:
</p>
<ol class="justify">
<li>
higher addresses on the stack are not corrupted
</li>
<li>
the maximum depth of the stack is not exceeded
</li>
<li>
the user code pops the same number of bytes off the stack
as it pushes on to it.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A return to SYS-EX may be made by executing a Z80 RET
instruction. If the Carry flag is set upon return to SYS-EX,
the message &ldquo;Error&rdquo; is displayed on the screen prior to the
acceptance of further input.
</p>
<p>
Upon entry to the extension code, various Z80 registers have
preset values. These values are as follows.
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 70%">
<tr><th>REGISTER(S)</th><th>CONTENTS</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>routine number or ASCII code</td></tr>
<tr><td>HL</td><td>value from ARG1</td></tr>
<tr><td>DE</td><td>value from ARG2</td></tr>
<tr><td>BC</td><td>Value from ARG3</td></tr>
<tr><td>SP</td><td>0C5FH within the NAS-SYS stack</td></tr>
</table>

Fortytwo bytes are available on the stack for use by the
