V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T Assembler Modifications
</h1>

The title of this article is somenhat of a misnomer as most
of the modifications are actually @ade to Nas-Dis, though they
are made to facilitate its use with the V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T asseabler.
</p>
<p>
One apparently miraculous feature of Nas-Dis is its ability
to disassemble a program directly into a ZEAP source file.
Other assemblers are catered for by dis-assembling to tape and
then reading the tape into the asseabler in its automatic aode.
Wile this works very well, there ig no doubt that the ability
to dis-assemble directly to the source area is a great advantage
and so, using the excellent listing of Nas-Dis, I made the
following modifications. These enable the tape version of
Nas-Dis to dis-assemble any program directly to the source area
of a VE T assembler.
</p>
<p>
As the V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T works in hex, the &lsquo;&pound;7, of hash, sign is not
required, 80 addresses C4FFH and CF&amp;0H are changed from 23H (&pound;)
to SeH ().
</p>
<p>
The message delimiter used by ZEAP is a &ldquo;/&rdquo; while V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T uses
so the following addresses need to be changed from 2FH to
</p>
<p>
274
</p>
<p>
coco
caps
e704
cear
</p>
<p>
fs the V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T can only put one DEFB on one line then the DINZ
instruction at C6E2/3 needs to be replaced by two NOPs. If this
course is followed then the program Will assemble with no
editing. If, however, the 3 at C6ES is replaced by 2 then the V
4 T DEFW can be used, though you must remember to reverse the
order of the two bytes while editing. Depending on which course
you follow, the 3 at CD6B needs to be changed to either 1 or 2.
</p>
<p>
The VAT isa little unusual in that it uses EX AF,AFG
instead of EX AF,AF&rsquo; to change to the alternate accumulator&rdquo; so
27H at CAS needs to pe changed to 47H, Another difference is
that ZEAP uses a null as the end of line marker while Vu T uses
AFH. CEDEH is the place to change.
