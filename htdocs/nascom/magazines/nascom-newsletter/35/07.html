Incorporating ZEAP source files into WordEase III
</h1>

<p>
The following program converts ZEAP source files into files
compatible with WordEase III, making it simple to fully document
ZEAP files with all the extra facilities offered by WordEase. A
comparison of ZEAP and WordEase file structure shows that
conversion from one to the other is fairly easy.
</p>
<p>
The first two bytes of the ZEAP edit buffer is an offset which
when added to the start address of the edit buffer (at &pound;0F00 in
ZEAP workspace) points to one more than the end of the file. &pound;00 is
used as the end of line marker, and ZEAP line numbers are stored as
two bytes which follow immediately after the previous line marker,
e.g. 92 01 = Line nunber 0192.
</p>
<p>
In WordEase the first two bytes of the file (at &pound;1000) is the
actual address of the end of file marker (&pound;FF, and the ends of
lines are marked by &pound;A0. The ZEAP line numbers have to be converted
into 4 byte ASCII strings, so that 92 01 converts to &pound;30 &pound;31 &pound;39
&pound;32 = &lsquo;0192&rdquo;,
</p>
<p>
The copious program notes should be sufficient to show how the
program works. However, a few further notes are required regarding
my system. I have two 64K RAM boards (paged as 0 and 1) and an
EPROM board (in page 0). ZEAP runs on page 0, but WordEase is
transfered into RAM on page 1 by means of a control program. This
explains the OUT commands in the TRANS routine. If your system just
has one page remove lines 190-220 and 240-250, and modify BUFP
(&pound;0F00) to a higher address after cold starting ZEAP, so that the
WordEase file has room below the ZEAF file. Remember though that
the WordEase file requires more memory than the ZEAP file, i.e. 4
bytes extra far each format code, and two more bytes per line
number.
</p>
<p>
If you have just one RAM page put the program an any convenient
location. If your system is similar to mine then run the program at
0C80, flip to page 1 with the command O FF 22, and then COLD START
WordEase. A cold start is necessary because the program as it
stands overlaps WordEase&rsquo;s workspace. The WordEase file is
unaffected by a cold start. Once in WordEase &ldquo;Adjust&rdquo; the text
before doing anything else. To simplify the program a little, every
time a &ldquo;Comment&rdquo; is encountered in the ZEAP file a &pound;A0 marker is
placed before it when transfered to the WordEase file. This was to
prevent line overflow. If there are more than 47 characters between
&pound;A0 markers WordEase will lock up. Note that full line &ldquo;Comments&rdquo;
should not exceed 42 characters in length.
