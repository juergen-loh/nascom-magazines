There ara other types of graphic display systems available, the
vector scan being the beat known. However, vector scan devices
and controllers, offer less colour shades and are considerably
fore expensive.
</p>
<p>
The display produced by the AVC can best be considered as 2 tuo
dimensional grid, the grid being divided into seall squares
(called pixels -&rsquo;picture elements) each of which can
</p>
<p>
be independently controlled by the computer. When viewed from a
distance these combinations of pixels merge together to fora
shapes. This ia similar to the way that newspaper photographs:
are produces &ndash; if you look closely at a newspaper photograph the
individual picture elements can be seen.
</p>
<p>
The AVC uses the raster scan principle. In this an electron
beam scans across the face of the display screen from left to
Fight, then moves down 2 line and repeats the left, right, down
sequence until it reaches the bottoa of the screen.&rdquo; This can be
compared with how a person reads or writes &laquo; page of text. As
the beam traverses the screen its energy is converted into light
by the special coating on the inside of the screen. the
intensity ef the light produced can be varied by changing the
energy of the beam. Colour displays are produced by having
three coatings (phosphors) to give the thres primary colour:
</p>
<p>
The whole screen is scanned fifty tines a second, which i= just
fast enough for the human eye to average out the &lsquo;Light. leval
</p>
<p>
Thus a stable picture is seen, and not just a moving spat of
Light. &ldquo;Thiw t= the way in which television pictures are formed
</p>
<p>
Whereas with raster scan syatens all the possible pixels are
traversed by tha beam, in vector scan aystens the beam is moved
only to the pixels&rsquo; which require ilumination. This provid
very fast line generation, but does not give
</p>
<p>
iT lumination.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The larger the number of pixels used the better will be the
definition of the picture formed. The AVC has tno resolution
</p>
<p>
1, SINGLE DENSITY, in which 392 horizontal and 256 vertical
pixels are used.
</p>
<p>
2. DOUBLE DENSITY, in which 784 horizontal and 256 vertical
pixels are used.
</p>
<p>
The AVC uses three separate bit-mapped memory planes to store
the pixels in. Bit-mapped means that each pixel on the display
screen is controlled by a known bit (or bite for colour) in ti
menory of the AVC. Each byte of the menory controls the status
@f wight horizontally adjacent pixels. The use of the three
Planes cf memory allows the atatus of the three primary colour
Planes to be controlled by the data inserted into the AVC
fenory. Because colour is mixture of the three primary hues
red, green blue, any colour can be produced by controlling
these three primary colours. Each of the three memory planes is
used to contral one of the primary colours
</p>
<p>
These memory planes are all on the AVC board, and do not
