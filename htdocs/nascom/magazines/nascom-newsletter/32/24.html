There are other types of graphic display systems available, the
vector scan being the beat known. However, vector scan devices
and controllers, offer less colour shades and are considerably
more expensive.
</p>
<p>
The display produced by the AVC can best be considered as a two
dimensional grid, the grid being divided into small squares
(called pixels &ndash; picture elements) each of which can
be independently controlled by the computer. When viewed from a
distance these combinations of pixels merge together to form
shapes. This is similar to the way that newspaper photographs
are produces &ndash; if you look closely at a newspaper photograph the
individual picture elements can be seen.
</p>

The AVC uses the raster scan principle. In this an electron
beam scans across the face of the display screen from left to
right, then moves down 2 line and repeats the left, right, down
sequence until it reaches the bottom of the screen. This can be
compared with how a person reads or writes a page of text. As
the beam traverses the screen its energy is converted into light
by the special coating on the inside of the screen. The
intensity of the light produced can be varied by changing the
energy of the beam. Colour displays are produced by having
three coatings (phosphors) to give the three primary colours.
The whole screen is scanned fifty tines a second, which is just
fast enough for the human eye to average out the light levels.
Thus a stable picture is seen, and not just a moving spot of
light. This is the way in which television pictures are formed.
</p>
<p>
Whereas with raster scan systems all the possible pixels are
traversed by the beam, in vector scan systems the beam is moved
only to the pixels which require ilumination. This provides
very fast line generation, but does not give constant
illumination.
</p>
<p>
The larger the number of pixels used the better will be the
definition of the picture formed. The AVC has two resolution
modes:
</p>
<ol class="number-dot">
<li>
SINGLE DENSITY, in which 392 horizontal and 256 vertical
pixels are used.
</li>
<li>
DOUBLE DENSITY, in which 784 horizontal and 256 vertical
pixels are used.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The AVC uses three separate bit-mapped memory planes to store
the pixels in. Bit-mapped means that each pixel on the display
screen is controlled by a known bit (or bits for colour) in the
memory of the AVC. Each byte of the memory controls the status
of wight horizontally adjacent pixels. The use of the three
planes of memory allows the status of the three primary colour
planes to be controlled by the data inserted into the AVC
memory. Because colour is mixture of the three primary hues
red, green and blue, any colour can be produced by controlling
these three primary colours. Each of the three memory planes is
used to control one of the primary colours.

These memory planes are all on the AVC board, and do not
