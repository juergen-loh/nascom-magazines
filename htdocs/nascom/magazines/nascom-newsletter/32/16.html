of the assembler so that setting the address of your copy of
<span class="uppercase">Compass</span> in line 1 will ensure that all subsequent addresses are
correct. The additions are &pound;05 bytes long so you will probably
have to move your copy to fit the extra code at the and of it.
This is advisable as the last two lines of the listing alter the
length of code checked after a warm start, so that the new code
is protected by a checksum, as well as the original.
</p>
<p>
The two new psuedo-ops use the CODE and BADOPC jumps to
break into the program and use similar legal coves for the
assembler to process.
</p>
<p>
When the assembler cones across a bad opcode, it jumps to
&pound;0F06 where it is redirected to NEWOPS. Here a check is made of
the opcode and, if neither RCAL nor SCAL, jumps back to the
BADOPC address in the assembler. If either is found then the
first character is stored and the compressed code for either JR
or SUB are substituted for processing. The reasons for these two
being chosen are that they are single codes which are followed
by appropriate operands. RCAL is similar to JR in operation and
SCAL, like SUB, is followed by a single operand which must be
&pound;FF or less. Note that no check is made for illegal SCAL
values.
</p>
<p>
This is all that is done on the first pass, but on the
second a check has to be made of the &lsquo;N&rsquo; option
is only checked if the code is to be stored. If the option has
been taken then it is reset and a flag set so that the break can
be made at the CODE jump.
</p>
<p>
The CODE jump at &pound;0F03 is diverted to <span class="uppercase">Substitute</span> and the
first check is whether it is one of the new codes that is being
loaded. If not, then the program returns to the assembler. At
this point registers A and B contain the opcode to be loaded and
this is changed to either &pound;D7 or &pound;DF as appropriate before
allowing the program to continue. If the &lsquo;N&rsquo; option was taken
then this is reset and the return to the assembler avoids that
part where the opcode is loaded.
</p>
<p>
That completes the alterations to the program operation and
if the program is loaded as in the listing then only one thing
remains to be done. This is the alteration of the checksum. The
length of the program to be checked has already been altered
but, of course, the checksum, which is stored after the last
byte of the program, will be incorrect. The way to find out the
new checksum is to set a breakpoint at <span class="uppercase">Compass</span>+&pound;0409 and then
warm start the assembler. When the breakpoint is reached HL will
point to the checksum store (+&pound;1A19 in the listing) and the
accumulator will contain the checksum. As <span class="uppercase">Compass</span>+&pound;0409
contained &pound;E7 instead of &pound;BE when it was checked, the checksum
in the accumulator will be &pound;29 greater than it should be, so
enter the accumulator value minus &pound;29 in the checksum store and
save the program, not forgetting to include the checksum.
