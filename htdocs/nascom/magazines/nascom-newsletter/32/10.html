<p class="continued">
perhaps day of week. I intend having only one routine to read
the clock, which will form part of a set of extended monitor
routines. Any program requiring clock data will call this
routine, and from its information select the relevant data.
When the chip changes (ticks?) between two reads, the register
next read is set to 0Fh, to indicate faulty data. In this case
it is necessary to reread the Completely. National
Semiconductor recommend that you should wait for a 0FH signal
from the clock before embarking on a full read. The routines
listed here print &lsquo;FAIL&rsquo; whenever a read fails for this reason,
and proceed to try again. The decision on how best to cope with
this I leave to you! Setting up a version of the same routines
to read the clock and print the time on the screen indicates
that a read takes approx 1&nbsp;mS.

In using this chip, a useful adjunct is to acquire a copy
of the National Semiconductor data sheet, which gives an
overall view of the intricacies of the chip, in particular use
of the interrupt. I&rsquo;ve not achieved 100% reliability in my use
of the interrupts and have therefore disregarded them in the
interests of getting on with things, but I feel sure that this
circuit will allow them to be used reliably. The software is
probably capable of considerable improvement, but as listed
here it works on a 4&nbsp;Mhz machine. 2&nbsp;Mhz may cause problems, as
the width of the NRDS (Read strobe) should be limited to 15u5
max according to the datasheet.

I am very happy with this chip and recommend it without
reserve in the circuit attached. If you are into Clocks, the
May &rsquo;82 BYTE, in Ciarcia&rsquo;s Circuit Cellar, shows a circuit for
another NS chip. This chip is the MM58167A, which is slightly
more expensive than the 58174, but offers a number of extra
facilities. It will time from 1/10000 secs up to months, but
knows nothing about leapyears. In addition, it has a low power
interrupt mode, allowing it when powered down to signal an
interrupt when a specified tine and date is reached. This could
offer the possibility of your machine being able to turn itself
on on Tuesdays at 2.50 p.m. to do whatever you wish! I intend
to build a number of specialised boards for my Nascom, and am
seriously considering incorporating the 58167A into
them.
