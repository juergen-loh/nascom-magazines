Recessary to reread the Completely. &ndash; National
Semiconductor recommend that you should wait for a 0FH signal
from the clock before embarking on a full read. The routines
listed here print &ldquo;FAIL&rdquo; whenever a read fails for this reason,
and proceed to try again. The decision on how best to cope with
this T leave to you&rsquo; Setting up a version of the same routines
to read the clock and print the time on the screen indicates
that a read takes approx 1 nS.

In using this chip, a useful adjunct is to acquire a copy
of the National Semiconductor data sheet, which gives an
overall view of the intricacies of the chip, in particular use
of the interrupt. I&rsquo;ve not achieved 100% reliability in ay use
Of the interrupts and have therefore disregarded them in&rsquo; the
interests of getting on with things, but I feel sure that this
circuit will allow them to be used reliably. The softnare is
probably capable of considerable improvement, but as listed
here it works on a 4&nbsp;Mhz machine. 2&nbsp;Mhz may cause problems, as
the width of the NRDG (Read strobe) should be limited to) 15u5
max according to the datasheet.

Tam very happy with this chip and recommend it without
reserve in the circuit attached. If you are into Clocks, the
May &rsquo;82 BYTE, in Ciarcia&rsquo;s Circuit Cellar, shows a circuit&rsquo; for
another NS &lsquo;chip. This chip is the MMSG1G7A, which is slightly
more expensive than the SB174, but offers a&rsquo; number of extra
Te will fom 1/10000 secu up to months, but
knows nothing about leapyears. In addition, it has a low &lsquo;power
interrupt &lsquo;allowing it when powered down to signal an
interrupt when a specified tine and date is reached. This could
offer the possibility of your machine being able to turn itself
