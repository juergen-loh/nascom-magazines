COMPASS ADDITIONS<br>
Extra Commands and Opcodes for<br>
LEVEL 9 COMPression ASSembler.

When I received the COMPASS Compression Assembler from Level
9 Computing of High Mycombe, I was disappointed to find that
RCAL and SCAL were missing as paeudo-opcodes. Having used the
assenbler for a while and got Used to it, 1 have been delving
into the may it works, There are three jumps, &pound;0F00, &pound;0FOS
and &pound;0F09, which can be intercepted and I have used the last two
Of these to add the tho &lsquo;missing&rsquo; pseudo-ops.
</p>
<p>
While looking for a way to use these jumps I came across the
command table and, as tno commands are duplicated in version 1.3
T decided to use those positions in the table to add two new
commands.
</p>
<p>
As I have a Centronics printer which has a parallel
interface, the print routine has to be via the NAS-SYS User
</p>
<p>
routing. This means that the instructions to the assembler
appear on the printaut and, while not a disaster, this is
something that I considered unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
The &lsquo;P&rsquo; command is the first command that I added and
operates by initialising the User routine and ports, setting the
</p>
<p>
Height command to print the full listing and jumping to the
assenbler&rsquo;s own Assemble command. If you wish, you can set the
Height command to a page length in line 21&rsquo; for manual form
feeds, or have them in your print routine though, I. believe,
the Epson printers have automatic form feeds.
</p>
<p>
The other thing that has often been a source of annoyance
has been the fact that, to obtain part of a listing, it has Been
necessary to print the whole. This is changed in. this command
between lines &pound;6B and &pound;76, by using a tick in the comments
column to control the switching on and off of the printer.
</p>
<p>
Once the listing has been completed the printer needs to be
switched off and the &lsquo;N&rsquo; command is used to do this, as well as
resetting the Height command to 5.
</p>
<p>
These are simple changes since all that is done is the
changing of the table addresses of redundant commands to the
addresses of the new commands.
</p>
<p>
It is advisable to check that the table addresses in your
version of the assembler are the same. If not, then delete the
last ten lines of the listing as they will change the addresses
to those of new commands, and change them manually. All
addresses within the assembler are given relative to the start
