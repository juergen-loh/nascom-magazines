conflict with the normal program memory of the Nascom computer.
They are only paged into the computer&rsquo;s memory map when it is
necessary to read or write data to the display.

To determine which bits of which memory location of which memory
plane to turn on and off in order to produce the required visual
effect is quite complicated. Fortunately extensive software
support is provided with the
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
which does the hard work for
you. This software is accessible using ROM BASIC and Extended
BASIC (XBASIC), and provides simple commands to control the
graphics operations. The support software occupies around 6K of
main memory. In CP/M machines it also provides an 80 column by
25 line character display as standard.

Suppose, for example, we want to plot a red circle near the top
right hand corner of the display. We need only issue commands
to select the colour, shape and size of the object to be drawn.
In this case the command/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>program statements would be a follows:
</p>
<p class="indent">
COLOUR 1<br>
APOLY 250,150,100
</p>
<p>
The instruction COLOUR indicates the colour to be used, and the
subsequent number indicates which of the available colours are
to be used. The colours available are as follows:
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>BLACK</td><td>.....</td><td>0</td><td style="padding-right: 2em"></td><td>BLUE</td><td>.....</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>RED</td><td>.....</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>MAGENTA</td><td>.....</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>GREEN</td><td>.....</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>CYAN</td><td>.....</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>YELLOW</td><td>.....</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>WHITE</td><td>.....</td><td>7</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The command APOLY specifies that we wish to draw a polygon (a
circle is a polygon with an infinite number of sides!). The
position to draw the circle is given by the X, Y co-ordintates
(250, 150 in this case) and the size of the circle is specified
by its radius, 100 in this case. The POLY command was chosen
since it gives much more generality in the shapes that can be
drawn than would a more specific command such as &lsquo;circle&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
Some of the commands available from XBASIC and ROM BASIC are
summarised below. In ROM BASIC each command is prefixed by the
word SET. Most commands are followed by one or more numeric
parameters (they can be variables in BASIC). In many cases
there are default values for these parameters, so that not all
of them need to be specified.

This command specifies the type of display required and which
