conflict with the normal program mesory of the Nascom computer.
Thay are only paged into the computer&rsquo;s memory map when it is.
necessary to read or write data to the display.
</p>
<p>
To determine which bits of which memory location of which mesory
plane to turn on and off in order to produce the required visual
effect is quite complicated. Fortunately extensive software
support is provided with the AVC which does the hard work for
you. This software is accessible using ROM BASIC and Extended
BASIC (XBASIC), and provides simple commands to control the
Graphics operations. The support software occupies around &amp;k of
fain. menory. In CP/M machines it also provides an @0 column by
25 line character display as standard.

Suppose, for example, we want to plot a red circle near the top
Fight hand corner of the display. We need only issue commands
to. select the colour, shape and size of the object to be dram.
In this case the command/program statements would be a follows:
</p>
<p>
coLouR 1
APOLY 250,150,100
</p>
<p>
The instruction COLOUR indicates the colour to be used, and the
subsequent number indicates which of the available colours are
to be used. The colours available are as follows:
</p>
<p>
BLACK 1.4.0 BLUE 4
Rept 1 MAGENTA 1LITL 5
GREEN 11122 CYAN. ile
VELtoW LDS wate | II0027
</p>
<p>
The command APOLY specifies that we wish to draw a polygon (a
circle is a polygon with an infinite number of sides&rsquo;). Th
position to draw the circle is given by the X, Y co-ordintates
(250, 150 in this case) and the size of the circle is specified
by its radius, 100 in this c The POLY command was chosen
since it gives much more generality in the shapes that can be
drawn than would a more spacific command such as &lsquo;circle&rsquo;.

the commands available from XBASIC and ROM BASIC are
ised below. In ROM BASIC each command is prefixed by the

Parameters (they can be variables in BASIC). In many cases
there are default values for these parameters, Yo that not all
of them need to be specified.

mODE&lt;a,b&gt;
This command specifies the type of display required and which
combinations of primary colours which are to be displayed.

There are five types of display available &mdash;
