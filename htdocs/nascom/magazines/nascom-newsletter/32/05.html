if between one and sight matches are found, the memory address
of the start of each match is displayed in the response line.
After the final match, XXXX is displayed to signify that the
search continued to the top end of memory. If nine matches are
found, all nine memory addresses are displayed in the response
line. After nine matches the command terminates without
searching any further.

<p class="noindent">
AAAA&nbsp;&ndash; memory address at which the search is to start.

The logic of this command is really quite involved. A
full description would require an article on its own.
Basically, the command obtains the first byte in the required
mask and searches through memory until it finds a match. The
second byte of the mask is then compared with the next
location in memory; if that matches, the third byte of the
mask is compared and so on. If the &lsquo;n&rsquo;th byte fails to match,
the command continues with searching for the first byte at the
memory location one beyond the previous first byte match.
Clearly, the command will for most of it&rsquo;s time be searching
for and failing to find a match on the first byte in the mask.
This matching exercise on the first byte in the mask was
therefore made as quick as possible, in order to minimise the
execution tine of the command. However, this approach does
mean that if the first byte of the mask occurs frequently in
memory, the command will take a little longer. On average, the
command will search 64K in a couple of seconds. However, if
the first two bytes of the mask are&nbsp;&ndash;say&ndash; 00 00 (00 usually
seems to occur frequently) it may take up to ten seconds to
search 64K. Times are for a processor running at 4MHz with
wait states.

Hexadecimal to decimal conversion
<p>
Converts a hexadecimal integer value in the range 0 to
FFFF, to decimal.
</p>
<p>
The result of the conversion to decimal is displayed on
the first screen line following the command letter. The
hexadecimal number is first displayed as it&rsquo;s signed decimal
equivalent with a preceding minus sign if the value is
negative. If the number is negative, a further value is
displayed to show the positive decimal equivalent of the
unsigned format hexadecimal number.
</p>
<p>
In order to determine the sign of the input argument
the command uses the number of input digits typed to determine
whether the argument represents a single or a double byte
value. If the number of digits typed is greater than two, a
double byte value is assumed, otherwise a single byte value is
assumed. If requires, leading zeroes may be typed in order to
force a double byte conversion.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
AAAA&nbsp;&ndash; hexadecimal value for conversion
</p>
<p>
Rather than just describe the operation, a commented
assembler listing of the conversion follows. The actual
SYS-EX code is slightly modified to cater for negative
numbers
