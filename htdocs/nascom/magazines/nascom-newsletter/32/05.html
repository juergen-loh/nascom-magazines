if between cne and sight matches are found, the menory address
of the start of each match is displayed in&rsquo;the response lin
After the final match, XXXX is displayed to signify that the

<p>
search continued to the top end of manory. If nine matches are
found, all nine menory addresses are displayed in the response
lin

After nine matches the command terminates without
rehing any further.
&lsquo;AAAA &ndash; memory address at which the search is to start.

The logic of this command is really quite involved. A
full description would require an article on its om.
Basically, the command obtains the firet byte in the required
mask and searches through memory until it finds &laquo; match. The
second byte of the mask is then compared with the next
location&rsquo;in memory) if that the third byte of the
ask i&raquo; compared and #0 on. n&rsquo;th byte fails to match,
the command continues with searching for the first byte at the
menory location one beyond the previous first byte match.
Clearly, the command will for most of it&rsquo;s time be searching
for and&rsquo; failing to find a match on the first byte in the mask
This matching exercise on the first byte in the mask was
therefore made as quick as possible, in order to miniaiae the
execution tine of the comand, However, this approach does
mean that if the first byte of the mask occurs frequently in
fenory, the command will take a littl longer. On average, the
Command will search 44K in a couple of seconds. However, if
the first two bytes of the mask are &mdash;say- 00 00 (00 usually
Agena to occur frequently) it may take up to ten seconds to
wearch 64K. Times are for @ processor running at 4MHz with
wait atater

Hexadecimal to decimal conversion
</p>
<p>
Converts a hexadecimal integer value in the range 0 to
FFF, to decimal.
</p>
<p>
The result of the conversion to decimal is displayed on
the first screen line following the command letter. The
hexadecimal number is first displayed az it&rsquo;s signed decimal
equivalent with a preceding minus sign if the value is
negative. If the number is negative, a further value is
displayed to show the positive decimal equivalent of the
unsigned format hexadecimal nunber.
</p>
<p>
In order to determine the sign of the input arguaent
the command uses the nunber of {nput digits typed to determine
whether the argument represents a single ora double byte
Value. If the number of digits typed ts greater than two,
Gouble byte value is asauned, otherwise a single byte value is
assumed.&rdquo; If requires ding zeroes may be typed in order to
</p>
<p>
force a double byte conversion.
AAAA &ndash; hexadecimal value for conversion
Rather than just describe the operation, a commented
asseatler listing of the conversion follows, The actual
BYE-EX code is slightly modified to cater for negative
