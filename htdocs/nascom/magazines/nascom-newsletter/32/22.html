<u>NEWS FROM NASCOM</u>
</h1>
<p>
This month we are using this space for the promised
<a href="#article3">article on the Advanced Video Controller card</a>
(<?php externalLink("AVC","",""); ?>)
and a software/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>hardware
modification which allows you to use a keyboard buffering
technique, and generate a clock at the same tine.
</p>
<p>
Those who have been waiting for their NAS-DOS version of
Extended BASIC (XBASIC) should have received their copy now &ndash;
apologies for the delay. We hope at some time in the future to
do a version of the &lsquo;Introduction to programming the Nascom
computer in (ROM) BASIC&rsquo; for XBASIC, but in the meantime the
existing reference manual provides all the information you need
to allow you to use it.
</p>
<p>
Other documentation planned is an improved NAS-DOS manual
summary cards for various products and the final version of the
SPEX manual.
</p>
<p>
Next month we plan to discuss applications of the AVC, and in
particluar to introduce the first release of NAS-CAD &ndash;
Computer aided design package. In addition we will discuss file
access methods, with examples drawn from both ROM BASIC and
XBASIC. The latter language is available under CP/M (with full
graphics support), so there will be something for the CP/M user
as wall as the NAS-SYS/NAS-DOS user. We will also describe a
method of adding soft (ie user programmable) function/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>control
keys at a cost of &pound;0.00, and more sophisticated means of printer
control from NAS-SYS.

<u>1.1 NAS-DOS/NAS-SYS utilities</u>
</h4>
<p>
It has only just been brought to my attention that the manual
for these utilities states that the entry point jump table is
located at nA00 etc &ndash; the table is of course at the beginning of
the utilities, ie n800 etc. Thanks to Movement Computers for
pointing this out. In fact a more compact version of the
utilities is now under test where the table is at nA00!!

Computers have developed substantially in the three decades of
their existence. Not only has their speed increased and their
size diminished, but major strides have been made in making them
