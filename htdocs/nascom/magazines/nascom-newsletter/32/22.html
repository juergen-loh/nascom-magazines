NEWS FROM NASCOM
</h1>
<p>
This month we are using this space for the promised article on
the Advanced Video Controller card (AVC) and &laquo; software/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>hardware
modification which allows you to use a keyboard buffering
technique, and generate a clack at the sage tine.
</p>
<p>
Those who have been waiting for their NAS-DOS version of
Extended BASIC (XBASIC) should have received their copy now &mdash;
apologies for the delay. We hope at sose time in the future to
do a version of the &lsquo;Introduction to programming the Nascom
computer in (ROM) BASIC&rsquo; for XBASIC, but in the meantime the
wisting reference manual provides all the information you. need
to allow you te use it,
</p>
<p>
Other documentation planned is an improved NAS-DOS manual
summary cards for various products and the final version of the
SPEX manual.
</p>
<p>
Next month we plan to discuss applications of the AVC, and in
particluar to introduce the first releame of NAS-CAD &ndash;
Computer aided design package. In addition wa will discuss file
acceas methods, with examples drawn from both ROM BASIC and
XBASIC. The latter language is available under CP/M (with full
graphics support), so there will be something for the CP/M user
2s wall as. the NAS-SYS/NAS-DOS user. We will also describe &laquo;
method of adding soft (ie user programmable) function/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>contral
keys at a cost of &pound;0.00, and more sophisticated means of printer
control from NAS-SYS.

1.1 NAS-DOS/NAS-SYS utilities
</p>
<p>
Tt has only just been brought to ay attention that the manual
for these utilities states that the entry paint jump table is
located at nA00 etc &ndash; the table is of course at the beginning of
the utilities, ie n00 ate. Thanks to Movement Computers for
Pointing this out. In fact a more compact version of the
Utilities is now under test where the table is at nA0d!!
