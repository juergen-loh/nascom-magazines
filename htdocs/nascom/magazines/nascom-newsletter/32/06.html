Insert a byte
<p>
Insert a single specified byte at a specified memory
location and move the original contents of that address and
above, upwards in memory to make space for the insertion.
</p>
<p>
The section of memory delimited by: (i) address for
insertion (ii) top limit for move minus two, is moved to the
memory locations delimited by (i) address for insertion plus
one, (ii) top limit for move minus one. The specified byte for
insertion is then moved to the insertion address. The &lsquo;top
Limit for move&rsquo; parameter is the same an defined for the &lsquo;e&rsquo;
command.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
AAAA&nbsp;&ndash; memory address at which the byte is to be
inserted.
<br>
BBBB&nbsp;&ndash; top limit for move. Memory addresses from this
address upwards are not accessed.
<br>
CC&nbsp;&ndash; hexadecimal representation of the byte to be
inserted.
</p>
<p>
The command uses the Z80 block transfer instruction LDDR
to shift the contents of memory upwards.
