The article by Hr. &amp;. Kirby in Micropowar Vol 2No 3 on a
Real Time Clock &lsquo;was most interesting, As readers buves are
getting more and more populated, it might be advisable to
Consider adding an output buffer to his circuit, as the 50174
chip does not have the high output of &laquo; bus driver chip. Those
tho are daunted by the prospect of wiring up a board to plug
{nto the bus might like to try another approach.
</p>
<p>
This approach is to hang the 58174 on the PIO, in a very
siailar circuit. Due to the slow speed of the RTC chip, it is
possible to drive it from the port lines, at the exper

tha clock on an Unexpanded &lsquo;Nascom. I have been using thi
circuit for nearly a year and have modified much of my software
to read the clock.
</p>
<p>
The circuit diagram is simple enough, tut a few points
might bear comment. The CS (Chip Select) line 1 inverted using
2 CMOS inverter, which is also driven from the standby battery
in power down&rsquo; made. The effect of power down on the chip
(eithout the inverter) seems to be to place a low level on CS,
NRDS and NWDS. For sone reason, this results frequently in los
of time. Adding the CHOS inverter means that the external low
Level of the PIO on power down is transmitted to the 58174 chip
az a high level, not enabling the chip, thereby preventing tine
logs. In addition to the three control lines I have detailed,
there are four address lines and five data lines. These art
connected up to the two ports of the PID.

<p>
To Port A are connected lines as follows!
Bit A0 &ndash; DBO pin 7
Bit A1 &ndash; DBI pin &amp;
Bit A2 &ndash; DB2 pin 5
Bit A5 &ndash; DBS pin 4
Bit Ad &ndash; pin 13 interrupt line)
To Port B are connected
BEE B0 &ndash; ADO pin 12
Bit B1 &ndash; ADL pin it
Bit B2 &ndash; AD2 pin 10
Bit B3 &ndash; ADS pin 9
Bit B4 &ndash; NWDS pin 3 (Write Strobe)
Bit B5 &ndash; NRDS pin 2 (Read Strobe)
Bit BS &ndash; CS pin 1 (inverted Chip Select)

differ between Ni and N2s. They can easily be read off the
circuit diagrams
