The command eliminates the spurious input of random
characters which is often associated with the switch on and
switch off of attatched tape recorders. Both the NAS-SYS and
the SYS-EX read and verify commands (and also NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 Load
command) are unaffected in their operation by the action of
the &lsquo;k&rsquo; command. If required, the normal NAS-SYS tables may
be restored by using the NAS-SYS &lsquo;N&rsquo; command.
</p>
<p>
The command adds 4 to the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; input table value and
then stores this value using the NAS-SYS NIM function. This
has the desired effect both in NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 and NAS-SYS&nbsp;3.

--- label name to be written ---<br>
Label a cassette tape
<p>
Writes a tape label with a specified name. Once written
a tape label will be recognised and displayed by the SYS-EX
commands &lsquo;q&rsquo;, &lsquo;r&rsquo;, &lsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;v&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
After entry of the &lsquo;l&rsquo; command, the prompt &lsquo;lName:&rsquo;
appears on the next screen line and the required label name is
entered on that line. The tape drive LED is switched on and
after about two seconds (4MHz), the tape label is sent to the
serial output port for writing to tape. Finally, the tape
drive LED is switched off.
</p>
<p>
The format of the tape label is as follows;
</p>
<p class="indent">
4 x D3H<br>
0 to 42 characters of label name<br>
1 space (00H if name length is 42)<br>
00H.
</p>
<p>
File and label names are normally entered on the same
line as the prompt &lsquo;.Name:&rsquo; which immediately follows the
entered command line. However, it is quite possible to enter a
name from a different line after first moving the cursor to
the line required. The name must begin in column 7 and must
be immediately preceded by the : character (7CH =
CONTROL/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SHIFT/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>/,). Any characters (including spaces) may be
included in file and label names. All space characters which
appear to the right of the final non-space character are
ignored.
</p>
<p>
If the CLOAD command in the 8K Basic causes a tape label
to be read, Basic will interpret the label as a program file
with the name D3H (a block graphics character). This is
unlikely to cause any problems.

Return to NAS-SYS
<p>
Returns exclusively to NAS-SYS using a NAS-SYS MRET
instruction.
</p>
<p>
This command will seldom be required as all of the
NAS-SYS keyboard commands are available in the normal way from
within SYS-EX.
