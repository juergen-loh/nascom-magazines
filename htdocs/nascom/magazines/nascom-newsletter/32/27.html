<h4>
GLOAD
</h4>
<p>
This command allows a previously saved picture to be recalled.
</p>
<h4>
FILL
</h4>
<p>
This command colours in an outlined shape.
</p>
<h4>
CURSOR
</h4>
<p>
This command returns the current cursor co-ordinates.
</p>
<h4>
CHECK
</h4>
<p>
This returns the colour of a specified pixel.
</p>
<h4>
DASH
</h4>
<p>
This allows the user to specify that lines and shapes are to be
drawn using dotted or dashed lines.
</p>
<p>
The preceding commands are mainly concerned with the way in which
pictures will be draw. The commands which follow specify the
actual drawing operations.
</p>
<h4>
PLOT
</h4>
<p>
This command sets the colour of a specified pixel. The position of
the pixel can be expressed in absolute terms, or relative to the
current position of the cursor.
</p>
<h4>
LINE
</h4>
<p>
This command draws a line on the display. The positions of the
start and end points can be absolute or relative to the current
cursor position, and lines can also be specified in terms of their
length and direction.
</p>
<p>
The shapes produced can also be scaled, rotated and sheared,
Shearing refers to an angular displacement of parts of the shape, so
that, for example, a square becomes a diamond, or capital letters
become italics.
</p>
<h4>
TRI
</h4>
<p>
This command is used to draw triangles, and can cope with all types
of triangle.
</p>
<h4>
RECT
</h4>
<p>
This command is used to draw rectangles. Like other commands it
provides for displacement, scaling, shear rotation and colouring.
</p>
<h4>
POLY
</h4>
<p>
This command draws polygons, ranging from triangles through to
circles. Many parameters can be specified, such as drawing the
radii or chords of circles. The command can also be used in drawing
curves.
</p>
<h4>
MAT
</h4>
<p>
This is a special command which allows the user to define a shape
and then move, colour, scale, rotate, shear etc it&nbsp;&ndash; a macro
facility. There is no limit to the complexity of shape defined in a
macro&nbsp;&ndash; other than the memory capacity of the computer!
