Erase a byte
<p>
Delete a single byte at a specified memory location and
move the contents of higher memory locations down to fill the
gap.
</p>
<p>
The section of memory delimited by: (i) address for
deletion plus one, (ii) top limit for move minus one, is moved
to the memory locations delimited by (i) address for deletion,
(ii) top Limit for move minus two. The &lsquo;top limit for move&rsquo;
parameter is the first memory address from and above which
memory is neither read from nor written to by this command.
The top limit for move must by greater than the address for
deletion by at least two bytes.
</p>
<p>
After deletion of the specified byte, the command
responds by displaying on the following screen line the
hexadecimal value of the deleted byte.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
AAAA &ndash; memory address at which the byte is to be deleted<br>
BBBB &ndash; top limit for move. Memory addresses from this
address upwards are not accessed.
</p>
<p>
The command uses the Z80 block transfer instruction LDIR
to shift the contents of memory downwards.

---- find mask ----<br>
Find
<p>
Find a specified character string, or a sequence of
bytes specified by hexadecimal values, and display the memory
address(es) at which it occurs.
</p>
<p>
The memory address at which the search is to start is
taken from the first argument (ARG1).
</p>
<p>
After entry of the &ldquo;f&rsquo; command, the cursor is positioned
at the start of the next line and the find mask may then be
entered in one of the following two formats.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
1. Character string
</p>
<p>
Theirst position in the mask line must contain the
double-quote character ("). The required character string must
start in the second position in the line and may contain any
characters (including spaces) except the double-quote
character. The string is terminated by a further double-quote
character or, if this is not present, the end of the line.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
2. Sequence of bytes pacified by hexadecimal values.
</p>
<p>
The mask is entered as a sequence of single byte
hexadecimal numbers (0 to FF), each one separated from the
next by at least one apace. The first value may start in the
first position on the line or may be preceded by as many
spaces as are required. The entire find mask must be contained
within a single line.
</p>
<p>
After entry of the mask, memory is searched from the
specified start address up to the top end of memory (FFFFH).
The response is always displayed on the screen line following
the entered mask. If no match is found, the response is XXXX.
