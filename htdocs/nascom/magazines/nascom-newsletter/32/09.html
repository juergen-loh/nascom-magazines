Give rise to the need for the transistor regulator drawn by fr.
Kirby. It ia out of specification to connect voltage levels
to inputs of CMOS chips which are more than 0.5 volts above
the power supply levels of the chip. Doing this &lsquo;can cause the
chip to latch up, with consequent data loss. That is why the
need for the transistor circuit arises. A simpler eethod is
shown in my circuit. The Diode Di can be a Germanium OA4S or
Similar, which can offer a Vf(formard voltage drop) of &ndash; apprax
0.5 volt. Unfortunately, such a diode will have an Ir(reverse
leakage) of typically S0uA. This leakage current is sone five
to ten times the power down supply current of the S874. In
consequence, the battery only lasts i/eth as long as it should
(approx three weeks opposed to 4-6 months). Replacing the
Germanium diode with &laquo; INSI49 or similar may give the latch up
problem, as Vf over such a diode is usually 0.7volts. The
Feverse leakage is only 0.025uA, 90 we don&rsquo;t affect our power
Consumption dramatically. Electrovalue list a Silicon Gchottky
Barrier Diode BAS 70-03 with Vf = 0,410 volte and Ir &lt; 200 nA
(0.0002uA). This diode costs a matter of pence, and cures the
problem of latch up, providing a very simple circuit.

It is possible to obtain &laquo; very neat Nicad battery, Listed
in several suppliers catalogues as PCB Battery, which makes a
very compact power supply for battery back up. The whole unit
can be made on a 2" square Veroboard, and works most reliably.
The variable capacitor is in theory capable of adjusting
the timekeeping of the clock to allow for variations in crystal
and temperature, but can be omitted, if you don&rsquo;t mind
resetting the clock every few months to adjust the seconds.
T must admit that inspite of having the variable capacitor,
1 ve not been able to adjust my clock to keep pace with the
pips on the BBC. It runs either two secs a day fast or slow, and
T can 8 get any adjustment between those limits. If rebuilding
the unit, I&rsquo;d be very tempted to omit the variable capacitor
in the interests of constructional simplification. One very
important point &ndash; the power supplies for the 4049 goto pin I
(@5v) pin one and pin 8 (Ov)!

The software consists of setting up address and control
</p>
<p>
fon one port, reading the data&rsquo; in on the other, and
resetting the control lines. As IT list it, the software is
rudimentary and extremely inelegant, but it will serve to. show
that your board works. It sets the clock with the time stored
in memory at 0DB0H, and using the routine at 0D00H causes the
clock to be read andthe time printed on the screen. This
routine is no practical use, as it prints the information
obtained from the clock as a string of figures. If you EODOO
twice in succession, you will see the time change on the
righthand side of the strings. I leave the organisation of your
own reading routines to you. In assembler listings, I print
date and time at the head of each page. The time is| relevant
there, as one may have a few printouts in the course of an
evening, and the time serves to distinguish between then. On
the other hand, my word processor requires only the date and
