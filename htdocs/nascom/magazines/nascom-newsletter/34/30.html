NEWS FROM LUCAS NASCOM
</h1>
<p>
&lsquo;This months excuse for = short contribution is pressure of work! Once
again I have had to postpone the article on function keys &ndash; anyone who
is really impatient can obtain a listing of part of some softmare
which uses this technique by sending me an SAE. Due to our planned
expanaion of te business we will shortly be appointing extra staff.
We need experienced hardware engineers, system and applications
Software engineers, technical support engineers and a documentation
engineer. If there is anyone out there who feels that he or she might
meet the bill, please write to our Personnel Department.

<p>
This month aes the release of information on the Winchester disc
systen, described below. In fact a nuaber of these have already been
delivered to customers at the time of writing. Other developaents are
lainly by way of enhancements to existing software products. We are
Continuing to try to improve the standard of our documentation, both
on new products and existing ones. In particular the release of | NAS-DOS
2-1 alec sees a new manual, which we hope will be found to be sore
&lsquo;user friendly&rsquo; than its predecessor. All&rdquo; manual updates are now
Generally be accompanied by a pocket-sized sumeary card.
</p>
<p>
In mentioning new releases of existing software can I yet again make a
plea for you to register your software purchases using the cards
Supplied with the products, This is in your own interests &ndash; special
sottware upgrade offers and technical support will ONLY be provided to
Ouners of registered products. From our knowledge of sales and
registrations it is obvious that not everyone registers. There are no
conditions attached or loss of any rights if you do register.

Returning to the question of documentation and general product
presentation (particularly software) it is interesting to see how the
microcomputer lndustry in general is now placing much more emphasis in
this area. As more new computer users appear, particularly in
business, software needs to become more polished and easy to use, with
corresponding improvements in documentation. However, while not
wishing to discourage # long needed move in that direction, I do have
Some reservations. There seems to be a danger that presentation of 2
product and documentation are becoming extessive &ndash; enormous manuals
and ever more fancy binders supporting incressingly complex. programs.
Are there still at feast some new Users who reafly only require
straighttorward basic software which is easy to understand and can be
explained fully in| @ manual&rdquo; of less than 100 pages&rsquo; Any comments
would be received with interest.

<p>
Ae the time of writing there is a special offer on the Lucas Lx8o
printer &ndash; @@ characters per second, 6 columns and while the offer
Taste only &pound;225. ihere are many special printing features, inetuding
expanded and compressed text, italics, bverprinting, undriining and
grophics. Ihiz offer will be for a limited period.
