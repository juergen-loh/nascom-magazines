NAG-NET NETWORKING SYSTEM
</p>
<p>
NAS-NET is a networking system which allows several Nascom computers
to be linked together to share the resources of a central ise and
printer. All the satellite computer (1 to Si are allowed) appears to
have 2 normal NAS-DOS disc operating system, but automatically
accesses the disc of the master computer hen disc access is required.
The system has been proved in customer sites for aver 12 months, and
has proved extremely popular, technically and from the point of view
of its low price and genuine availability. Schools and other
educational establishments in particular have been major customers.
</p>
<p>
Rev 2.1 of NAS-NET has now been released. Again it is fully
compatible with the previous releases, and upgrading to the latest
sue iw not necestary for existing users. There are a nunber of
internal improvements, but the most immediately obvious to the user 15.
that files stored of disc are now given 2 terminal number, and are
accessible only by that terminal number and the master computer. The
terminal nusber is specified by the user on joining the network, and
is not a function of a particular piece of computer hardware. &lsquo;Some
changes have also been made to the way that access is gained to the
central printer via &lsquo;spool&rsquo; files on the disc. These too are now
automatically identified by terminal number, and printing of these can
be initiated from the satellite computer.
</p>
<p>
Most NAS-DOS appiications software is now available for use with NAS-NET.
In practice the difference from the standard versions of the
software is limited to the printer access &ndash; in the network version
thie will automatically make use of the printer on the central
computer, Software now available in this form includes the NAS-PEN
and SPEX word processors, the NAS-CALC spread sheet program and the
MANOR database manager.
