2. Improved error messages
</p>
<p>
3. File locking
</p>
<p>
4. File identification by terminal number when using the NAS-NET
networking system.
</p>
<p>
5. Formatting removed from the operating system to make way for other
improvements, and also to eliminate the possibility of faulty
assembler programs managing to re-format the disc!
</p>
<p>
6. New and improved utility programs on disc, now including a disc
formatting program. This disc will be supplied with NAS-DOS in
future, rather than at registration time, since alhtough the existing
utilities are not essential to use of the system, disc formatting is!
</p>
<p>
7. New and expanded manual.
</p>
<p>
A special version of NAS-DOS for use with the Winchester disc is also
available. This supports the Winchester as the main disc drive, and
uses utility programs to read files from floppy disc where this
facility is required (eg for program loading and transfer).

Nas-Net Networking System
</h2>
<p>
NAS-NET is a networking system which allows several Nascom computers
to be linked together to share the resources of a central disc and
printer. All the satellite computer (1 to 31 are allowed) appears to
have a normal NAS-DOS disc operating system, but automatically
accesses the disc of the master computer when disc access is required.
The system has been proved in customer sites for over 12 months, and
has proved extremely popular, technically and from the point of view
of its low price and genuine availability. Schools and other
educational establishments in particular have been major customers.
</p>
<p>
Rev 2.1 of NAS-NET has now been released. Again it is fully
compatible with the previous releases, and upgrading to the latest
issue is not necessary for existing users. There are a number of
internal improvements, but the most immediately obvious to the user is
that files stored of disc are now given a terminal number, and are
accessible only by that terminal number and the master computer. The
terminal number is specified by the user on joining the network, and
is not a function of a particular piece of computer hardware. Some
changes have also been made to the way that access is gained to the
central printer via &lsquo;spool&rsquo; files on the disc. These too are now
automatically identified by terminal number, and printing of these can
be initiated from the satellite computer.
</p>
<p>
Most NAS-DOS applications software is now available for use with NAS-NET.
In practice the difference from the standard versions of the
software is limited to the printer access &ndash; in the network version
this will automatically make use of the printer on the central
computer. Software now available in this form includes the NAS-PEN
and SPEX word processors, the NAS-CALC spread sheet program and the
MANOR database manager.
