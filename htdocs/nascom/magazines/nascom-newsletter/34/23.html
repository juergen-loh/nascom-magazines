Rewaraing a cold start is not for the faint-hearted, maybe
ny hardware problems are confusing it all, but I fheve not
Succeeded (is ay meory ReMshackled?). In fact, I have several
times killed tert (with and without extension) totally but
refound that text in Naw-Sys by filling suspect locations with
20H, removing the stop FFH character at 1@2iH and then putting
the correct end-of-file address in 1B1BH and 1@1AH (high byte in
high address). The location 101CH can be ignored it seer
Tabbing upwards from 1B21H (in QEH blocks! it is obvious when
the end-of-&mdash;file appears. You will see about 6 FFHa or at least
the end of your schpiel. Take it from me, you can rehwat Naspen
too often.

1 don&rsquo;t recall seeing any review of the I/O PROM programmer
but having used one for six months, Zam full of pra Th
fact, the only real hassle was having to solder one cable end
and the PROM personality plug. The software ia the operating
manual almost, which is how programs should be &ndash; at mans
service. Tt covers 2708, 2716 and 2732 PROMs but with a Jittle
Quile 27648 and 271208 can be accomodated. Points to note are
the need for 21 volts not 25. 1c you need the faster 27520,
beware of the same lower programming voltage requirenent.

CMOS versions of everything are pouring out from all
manufacturers. National have a Z80. They, Motorola and RCA have
aany 74HC series parts fast gnough and beefy enough to do most
TTL tasks. Projects planned for your intrepid reporter include
using CMOS 27168, first to reduce power to law per PROM and
also to keep things cooler. After that, the hottest parts are
the 260 and bipolar PROMS. Another project is to try using
X2B16s, they are 5 volt only EEPROMs made by Xicor. If you have
&pound;28 plus VAT (Vear and Tear), professional uxera can get them
from Micro Call, Thame, Oxon&rsquo; (tame oxen indeed), The nice touch
is that they sport on-board Latches which means that providing
you only write to them once in 105 they behave Jike 2K,
Ron-volatile RAMS. I have experimented with them but the first
try failed. We are close though, so stay tuned to this channel
folks. Unless anyone has tried using 2616 or 27cle8, in which
case they can wite to Cresby (in a plain, brown envelope).
