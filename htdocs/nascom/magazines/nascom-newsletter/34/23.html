Rewarming a cold start is not for the faint-hearted, maybe
my hardware problems are confusing it all, but I have not
succeeded (is my meory RAMshackled?). In fact, I have several
times killed text (with and without extension) totally but
refound that text in Nas-Sys by filling suspect locations with
20H, removing the stop FFH character at 1021H and then putting
the correct end-of-file address in 101BH and 101AH (high byte in
high address). The location 101CH can be ignored it seems,
Tabbing upwards from 1021H (in 0EH blocks) it is obvious when
the end-of-file appears. You will see about 8 FFHs or at least
the end of your schpiel. Take it from me, you can reheat Naspen
too often.

RAMbling on

What is the best way to psych a chip? I find that the
hottest ones are generally candidates for replacement when
searching for faults. Using one of the more sensitive parts of
the body as a thermometer gives rise to in-jokes about kissing
RAMs, not to mention BUS drivers. Jest not, it works.
Experimentors are advised to switch off first &ndash; 4MHz tastes
vile!

I don&rsquo;t recall seeing any review of the I/O PROM programmer
but having used one for six months, I am full of praise. In
fact, the only real hassle was having to solder one cable end
and the PROM personality plug. The software is the operating
manual almost, which is how programs should be &ndash; at man&rsquo;s
service. It covers <?php externalLink("2708","",""); ?>, <?php externalLink("2716"); ?> and <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> PROMs but with a little
guile <?php externalLink("2764","",""); ?>s and 27128s can be accomodated. Points to note are
the need for 21&nbsp;volts not 25. If you need the faster <?php externalLink("2732A","",""); ?>,
beware of the same lower programming voltage requirement.

Chipping in

CMOS versions of everything are pouring out from all
manufacturers. National have a Z80. They, Motorola and RCA have
many 74HC series parts fast enough and beefy enough to do most
TTL tasks. Projects planned for your intrepid reporter include
using CMOS 2716s, first to reduce power to 10mW per PROM and
also to keep things cooler. After that, the hottest parts are
the Z80 and bipolar PROMs. Another project is to try using
X2816s, they are 5&nbsp;volt only EEPROMs made by Xicor. If you have
&pound;28 plus VAT (Vear and Tear), professional users can get them
from Micro Call, Thame, Oxon (tame oxen indeed). The nice touch
is that they sport on-board latches which means that providing
you only write to them once in 10mS they behave like 2K,
non-volatile RAMs. I have experimented with them but the first
try failed. We are close though, so stay tuned to this channel
folks. Unless anyone has tried using 2816 or 27c16s, in which
case they can write to Cresby (in a plain, brown envelope).
