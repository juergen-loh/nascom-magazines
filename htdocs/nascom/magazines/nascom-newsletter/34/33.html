The new Winchester disc mentioned above can now be used with NAS-DOS,
although a special version of NAS-DOS must be specified at time of
purchase. In a networking system the effects of the increased storage
capacity and fast storage and retrieval of data are particularly
dramatic.

CP/M NEWS.

<p>
The CP/M disc operating system has generally proved most popular with
those who wish to run standard business applications software. Both
CP/M and the programs to run with it are generally significantly more
expensive than the corresponding NAS-DOS versions. A very wide range
of software is available to use with CP/M from many sources. If you
are buying software from some other source do be careful to ensure
that the disc is supplied in the right format &ndash; most suppliers should
be able to provide Nascom format. A range of the more popular
software is available from oursleves through the usual dealers, and
this is of course in the correct format and will normally also have
been configured for the correct terminal facilities. There are
differences in the single and double sided disc drive formats, and
although you can access discs easily via a utility program (SINGLE or
DOUBLE it wilt generally be more convenient in you specify the
appropriate version at the time of ordering.

<p>
The most popular languages used when programming with CP/M are Nascom
Extended BASIC and Microsoft&rsquo;s BASIC&nbsp;80 (also known as MBASIC). Both
are available through Nascom dealers. Easily the most popular
applications programs are Sorcim&rsquo;s Supercalc and MicroPro&rsquo;s Wordstar,
again available through your dealer. We can also supply, amongst
others, DBASE&nbsp;II&nbsp;, FMS and Datastar, which are database programs,
Spellstar, Calcstar and Datastar from the same stable as
Wordstar, the various financial programs which make up the
FINAS/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>ACCENSE suite and the NEWSPAC Newsagents package. The range is
steadily increasing, so consult your dealer if your requirements are
not on this list. Soon to be released is a very powerful low-cost
computer aided design and drawing package, known as LOTTI, which is
mentioned elsewhere in this newsletter.

Sorcim have recently released a new and improved version of Supercalc
&ndash; Supercalc&nbsp;2. This contains a number of improvements over the
previous version, and a new manual is provided. This is a much larger
manual than previously, and sore thought seems to have gone into its
structure. Overall a worthwhile improvement to what was already an
extremely fine product.

MicroPro have also re-vamped their products, with Wordstar Release
3.30 and corresponding MailMerge and Spellstar programs. New
documentation here too, properly printed at last and very methodically
and well laid out although I don&rsquo;t feel the &lsquo;cartoons&rsquo; really add
anything of value. The total volume of the documentation is rather
alarming, particularly if you get Reportstar and Datastar at the same
time! All the manuals are in the same, A5 (half AA) size, and are in
cloth bound ring binders in cloth bound card sleeves &ndash; very impressive
in appearance. A new product to me is StarIndex which was included in
the documentation. This locked a very good way of preparing indexes,
particularly when modifying manuals moves the page numbers.
Unfortunately although the manual was present in both sets which we
