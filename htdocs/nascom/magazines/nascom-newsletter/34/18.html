There are probably better sorts around for the Nascom, but
either they are being kept a dark secret, or I have missed their
publication (not a difficult trick in Saudi Arabia), so I
decided to write my own. Being an ardent exponent of the art of
coarse programming, my code owes nothing to elegance and even
does a couple of naughties, hence the name, BruteSort.
</p>
<p>
I am not sure of the sorting jargon but I think it&rsquo;s a
modified Shell-Shuffle-Shuttle sort (or have I just invented a
test of soberiety? Try saying that when you have had a few). The
logic of the thing was taken from a BASIC listing in a magazine
and there are probably more efficient algorithms around but I&rsquo;ve
found it adequate for my needs. No! Lets be honest, it impresses
the hell out of me.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ll leave it to others to obtain accurate timings, but
going by the kitchen clock, BruteSort takes about 3 seconds to
sort a 1000 element array of random strings. This sorted array
can then be sorted into descending order in about 1.6 seconds
while it takes a dazzling 0.9 seconds to resort the array with
one element out of sequence. All these timings were on a machine
running at 4MHz.
</p>
<p>
The code sits at A000H and is 12BH bytes long, so remember
when initialising BASIC that &lsquo;Memory Size&nbsp;?&rsquo; must not exceed
40960.
</p>
<p>
There are several ways in which BruteSort can be used. Lets
take the following string as a typical example in the array
dimensioned DA$(500).
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;25402088LOGS J         LONDON         SORTER         &rdquo;
</p>
<p>
This string is a concatenation of four fields:
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>1.</td><td>ID No.</td><td>8 characters</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.</td><td>Name</td><td>15 characters</td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>Home</td><td>15 characters</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td><td>Occupation</td><td>15 characters</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
To sort the entire array by name (omitting the zeroeth element,
but BruteSort can handle it a you wish)&hellip;
</p>
<p class="indent">
A=USR(0)DA$(1),500,9,23,A
</p>
<p class="continued">
&hellip;will do the trick provided that A does not evaluate to -1. If
it does then a descending sort will be returned.
</p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s say, for some unfathomable reason, we wish to sort
