There are probably better sorts around for the Nascom, but
either they are being kept a dark secret, or I have missed their
Publication (not a difficult trick in&rsquo; Saudi Arabia), so I
Secided to write my own. Being an ardent exponent of the art of
coarse programming, my code owes nothing to elegance and even
does @ couple of neughties, hence the name, BruteSort.
</p>
<p>
I am not sure of the sorting jargon but I think it = a
modified Shell-Shuffle-Shuttle sort (or have I just invented 2
test of soberiety? Try saying that when you have had a few). The
logic ef the thing was taken from a BASIC listing in a magazine
and there are probably more efficient algorithms around but I ve
found it adequate for my needs. No! Lets be honest, it impresses
the hell out of me.

111 leave it to others to obtain accurate timings, but
going by the kitchen clock, BruteSort takes about 3 seconds to
fort a 1002 element array of random strings. This sorted. array
Ean then be sorted into descending order in| about 1.6 seconds
while 1t takes 2 dazzling&nbsp;.9 seconds to resort the array with
one element out of sequence. All these timings were ons machine
running at ane.

<p>
The code sits at AQ@OH and is 126H bytes 1ong, so remember
when initialising BASIC that Memory Size &gt; must not exceed
foseo.
</p>
<p>
There are several ways in which BruteSort can be used. Lets
take the following string as @ typical example in the array
dimensioned DAS (582).
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;25a02@08L06S J LONDON SORTER &ldquo;
</p>
<p>
This string 18 @ concatenation of four fields:
</p>
<p>
1. 1D No. 8 characters
2. Name 15 characters.
3. Home 15 characters
</p>
<p>
4. Occupation 15 characters
</p>
<p>
To sort the entire array by name (omitting the zeroeth element,
but BruteSort can handle it a you wish)...
</p>
<p>
ARUBR(@)DAS(1) ,528,9,25,0
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;
</p>
<p>
ceewill do the trick provided that A does not evaluate to &ndash;
it does then s descending sort will be returned.
</p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s say, for some unfathomable reason, we ian to sort
