Routine no. 7B <span style="padding-left: 3em">Name: FCEP1</span>
</p>
<p>
Find in memory a single occurrence of the mask which
immediately follows on from the routine number. The mask may be
any length and is terminated with 00H. (eg. to find AA BB CC&nbsp;,
code CD 03 B0 7B AA BB CC 00&nbsp;) The search starts at the
memory address contained in ARG1 in the NAS-SYS workspace and
continues to FFFFH or to the first occurrence of the required
mask, whichever occurs first. If the mask is found, the Zero
flag is set OFF at completion and the address of the match is in
the HL register pair. If the search stops at FFFFH, the Zero
flag is set ON.

Routine no. 7C <span style="padding-left: 3em">Name: FCEP2</span>
</p>
<p>
Find in memory a single occurrence of the mask whose start
address is contained in ARG2 in the NAS-SYS workspace. The mask
may be any length and is terminated with 00H. The search starts
at the memory address contained in ARG1 in the NAS-SYS workspace
and continues t0 FFFFH or to the first occurrence of the
required mask, whichever occurs first. If the mask is found,
the Zero flag is set OFF at completion and the address of the
match is in the HL register pair. If the search stops at FFFFH,
the Zero flag is set ON.

Routine no. 7D <span style="padding-left: 3em">Name: SGNNO</span>
</p>
<p>
Output in ASCII the decimal equivalent of the signed
hexadecimal value in NUMV in the NAS-SYS workspace. The number
of digits in NUMN in the NAS-SYS workspace is used when
determining the sign. (eg. If NUMV = 00FFH and NUMN = 2 or less,
then the result will be -1. If NUMV = 00FFH and NUMN = 3 or
more, then the result will be 255.) If the result of the
conversion is negative, a leading minus sign is output. Decimal
values in the range minus 32768 to plus 32767 may be output.

<p>
Routine no. 7E <span style="padding-left: 3em">Name: USGNO</span>
</p>
<p>
Output in ASCII the decimal equivalent of the unsigned
format hexadecimal value in NUMV in the NAS-SYS workspace.
Decimal values in the range 0 to 65535 may be output.

<p>
Blank out the current screen line from the cursor position
onwards. Do a carriage return unless the cursor is at the start
of a line.
