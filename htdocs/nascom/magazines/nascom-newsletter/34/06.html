Routine no. 7B Namer FCEPL
</p>
<p>
Find in memory a single occurrence of the mask which
immediately followa on from the routine number. The mask may be
any length and is terminated with @@H. (eg. to find AA BB. CC
code CD @3 BQ 7B AA BB CCQO) The search starts at the
memory address contained in ARGI in the NAS-SYS workspace and
Continues to FFFFH or to the first occurrence of the required
mask, whichever occurs firat, If the mask is found, the Zero
flag&rsquo;is set OFF at completion and the address of the match is in
the HL register pair. If the search stops at FFFFH, the Zero
flag is set ON.

Routine no. 7C Names FCEP2
</p>
<p>
Find in memory a single occurrence of the mask whose start
address is contained in ARG2 in the NAS-SYS workspace. The mask
may be any length and is terminated with OQH. The search starts
AU the memory address contained in ARG! in the NAS-SYS workspace
and continues tp FFFFH or to the first occurrence of the
Fequired mask, whichever occurs first. If the mash is found,
the Zero flag is set OFF at completion and the address of the

the Zero flag ia set ON.

<p>
Output in ASCIT the decimal equivalent of the signed
hexadecimal value in NUMV in the NAS-SYS workspace. The number
of digits in NUNN&rdquo; in the NAS-SYS workspace is Used when
determining the sign. (eg. If NUMV = 00FFH and NUNN = 2 or Less
then the result will be i. If NUNV = B0FFH and NUNN = 3. or
more, then the result will be 255.) If the result of the
Conversion is negative, a leading minus sign is output. Decimal
Values in the range minus 32748 to plus 52767 may be autput.
