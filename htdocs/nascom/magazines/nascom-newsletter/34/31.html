IME WINCHESTER DISC
</p>
<p>
Winchester discs ditfer from the more familiar tloppy disc drives in
that their mode of operation ie quite different, and the storage
medium is &lsquo;sealed in the drive unit rather than being removabl.
Because the disc operates ih a sealed environment, with no variation
in the storage medium, the speed of access can be far faster than
with @ floppy disc, and the capacity is also much greater. At the
Present time we are offering three versions of the Winchester disc &ndash;
5m byte, 18M byte and 20H byte versions. hese contrast with the 375K
bytes of a Single sided floppy disc and 750K of a dual sided disc.
The dise is controlled by the computer in a different way to the
floppy disc, and therefore a different controller card is titted in
the computer: This replaces the normal floppy disc controller
</p>
<p>
but &ldquo;also provides @ floppy disc controller on the same board,
13 also a high speed communications facility on this board for u
networking or other applications.
</p>
<p>
Ihe Winchester disc with its large storage capacity and fast access
Mill be of particular interest to the business user with large data
files, and to users of networks. Support tor the Winchester disc is
available through bath the NAS-DOS and CP/M disc operating systema.
In the case of LF/M the Winchester is incorporated in&rsquo; the system by
running a. special program (automatically if you wish), while in the
case of NAS-DOS the Winchester version of the operating system should
be speci tied wnen ordering.

IME NAS-US DISC OPERATING SYSTEM
</p>
<p>
NAS-DOS 15 the disc operating system used by Nascam computers which
provides compatibility with the simple tape operating system. A range
0F applications software and system software is availbie, generally
Lest described as cheap and cheertull. None costs more than &pound;70, and
while lacking the sophistication of some of the more expensive
Programs for the CP/M operating system they have the considerable
Sdvantage of being easy to use and fast in operation. NAS-DOS was the
first disc operating system released by us for the Nascom computers,
and has aluays been the most popular. A new release of this operating
system, Rev 2.1, is under test at the time of weiting, and will be
avaifable by the time this article appears in print.
</p>
<p>
As in previous updates to NAS-DOS the latest release is fully
Compatible with previous versions, and represents refinements to the
existing product rather than @ major new development. While a special
offer will be made to existing registered owners of NAS-DOS to allow
thea to upgrade to the latest retease, we would suggest that for @owt
people there will be little advantage in doing so. Details of the
Special upgrade offer will be released en the next issue of the
magazine.
</p>
<p>
the changes incerporated in Rey 2.1 of NAS-DOS are as follows:
</p>
<p>
1. Standard version supports 6S track to track disc drives &ndash; the
half-height units now being used by Nascom. Special versions of the
operating system to suit older, lower speed, drives can be supplied to
order.
