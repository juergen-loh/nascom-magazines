THE WINCHESTER DISC
</h2>
<p>
Winchester discs differ from the more familiar floppy disc drives in
that their mode of operation is quite different, and the storage
medium is sealed in the drive unit rather than being removable.
Because the disc operates is a sealed environment, with no variation
in the storage medium, the speed of access can be far faster than
with a floppy disc, and the capacity is also much greater. At the
present time we are offering three versions of the Winchester disc &ndash;
5M&nbsp;byte, 10M&nbsp;byte and 20M&nbsp;byte versions. These contrast with the 375K
bytes of a single sided floppy disc and 750K of a dual sided disc.
The disc is controlled by the computer in a different way to the
floppy disc, and therefore a different controller card is fitted in
the computer. This replaces the normal floppy disc controller
but also provides a floppy disc controller on the same board. There
is also a high speed communications facility on this board for use in
networking or other applications.

<p>
The Winchester disc with its large storage capacity and fast access
will be of particular interest to the business user with large data
files, and to users of networks. Support for the Winchester disc is
available through both the NAS-DOS and CP/M disc operating systems.
In the case of CP/M the Winchester is incorporated in the system by
running a special program (automatically if you wish), while in the
case of NAS-DOS the Winchester version of the operating system should
be specified when ordering.

THE NAS-DOS DISC OPERATING SYSTEM
</h2>
<p>
NAS-DOS is the disc operating system used by Nascom computers which
provides compatibility with the simple tape operating system. A range
of applications software and system software is availble, generally
best described as cheap and cheerfull. None costs more than &pound;70, and
while lacking the sophistication of some of the more expensive
programs for the CP/M operating system they have the considerable
advantage of being easy to use and fast in operation. NAS-DOS was the
first disc operating system released by us for the Nascom computers,
and has always been the most popular. A new release of this operating
system, Rev 2.1, is under test at the time of writing, and will be
available by the time this article appears in print.
</p>
<p>
As in previous updates to NAS-DOS the latest release is fully
compatible with previous versions, and represents refinements to the
existing product rather than a major new development. While a special
offer will be made to existing registered owners of NAS-DOS to allow
them to upgrade to the latest release, we would suggest that for most
people there will be little advantage in doing so. Details of the
special upgrade offer will be released in the next issue of the
magazine.
</p>
<p>
The changes incorporated in Rev 2.1 of NAS-DOS are as follows:
</p>
<p>
1. Standard version supports 6mS track to track disc drives &ndash; the
half-height units now being used by Nascom. Special versions of the
operating system to suit older, lower speed, drives can be supplied to
order.
