The manual supplied is rather sparse. It tells you how to
set up the board and the principles behind how you get it to
work but it leaves you to the 9511 data book to give you &amp;
description of the different commands available and how to use
then. It doesn&rsquo;t seen quite the right way about doing things but
it does give you all the facts that you need to make the board
work and stare to earn some of it&rsquo;s worth.

The machine code programmer should find this board very easy
to get along mith and easy to use. For those of you who would
mant_to use it in an applications type environment, Hisoft HPS
in CP/M format is supplied (but not with my review board because
a) the Pascal was not availbale and b) 7 haven t got access to
crm.
</p>
<p>
Using the processor from a high-level language will either
require patching in the required routines or tansferring
everything to machine code calle (UBR). If the board is
Successful, I would imagine that patches for most commonly used
high-tevael languages will be published. If, however, you need to
use USRs, the speed gain by the processor will probably be lost
in setting up the entry point and parameters.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion then, the HSA-68B board is 2 nice complenent
to the Nascom computer: A system comprising of a graphics card
(QVC or other) plus the processor board should be capable of
some quite impressive feats. It is a rather expensive board but
sf you want the arithmetic capability of the 9511, you are
unlikely to get it much cheaper. Programming the processor is
very straight forward and most people should sind it easy to get
to grips with. It does allow parallel processing to an. extent
(the HSA-GBB can be calculating while the Nascom 760 is drawing)
but the addition of an interrupt facility mauld be very welcone.
I think that on the whole, this is the only point missing from a
very nice product.
