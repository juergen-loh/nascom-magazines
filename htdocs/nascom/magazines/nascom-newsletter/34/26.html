Now you can read the time in the addres ecezH-acesH and
time differences can be measured by subtracting tho time values.
fs TP1 gives S@eHz, you can measure time differences of up to
3.5 minutes with an accuracy of 1/300 of a wecond. You can reset
the timer at any time, either from Nas-Sys (using the M cammand)
or from BASIC (using DOKE). The timer cannot be used under
Nas-Sys&nbsp;1 as this is not interruptable,

xBASIC tip
A tip to all bone idle users of XBASIC who, having written their
</p>
<p>
ultimate, high-speed data-handling routine which has lots of
internal GOTO/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>GOSUBS, find that when they install it in. their
main program it runs very slowly because it is located way down
the program, miles from the start, here is an easy solution:
</p>
<p>
10 program
</p>
<p>
3@ GOSUB routine
</p>
<p>
9999 REN routine
10000 TEXTPTReDEEK (81004) 1HOLD 10000
19829 REM routine proper
</p>
<p>
10999 REM REM end of routine
11@@0 DOKE 41086, TEXTPTR: RETURN
</p>
<p>
You may say &ldquo;why not use MGE before the RETURN, well, it
doesn t work, it terminates the program end returns &lsquo;to command
level which is understandabl
</p>
<p>
T have used this method in a program which has a &ldquo;SORT routine
and two SEARCH&rsquo; routines and all three run mich faster. 1 timed
the sort routine and it runs 28% faster using the above method.
Now, can anyone tell me how to set up a type-ahead buffer for
XBASIC as the authors seem to have used their. Onn heyboard
routine and I haven&rsquo;t, as yet, managed to find it?
