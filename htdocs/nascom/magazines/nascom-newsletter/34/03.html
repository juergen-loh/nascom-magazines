Read a cansette tape and search for a file name which
Matches with the required program name, When a match is found,
read the program into memory.

ra on the next screen line and the required program name is
antered on that. line, If the first program is required
(irrespective of the name) just press ENTER at this point.
Optionally, &lsquo;transparent&rsquo; characters may be entered as part of
the required program name. A transparent character will match
mith any character read into that&rsquo; position. The transparent
Character is ASCII 7FH. (CONTROL:SHIFT#/)

<p>
The tape drive LED is switched on and the cassette tape is
searched for tape and file labels. Any tape labels detected ere
displayed on the top line of the scr#en without interruption of
the command. As each file or program label is detected, the
name is displayed on the screen line immediately below the
required program name. Any name or text which was previously
displayed on that line is blanked aut. The program name and. the
required name are compared. A required program name will match
with an identical name read from cassette tape. Also,
Fequired name will match with a longer name read from
</p>
<p>
tape, providing that all the characters match up
including the last character (ie, last non-space) of the
required name. If a file name read from cassette tape fails to
match the required name, the search continues. When a match is
found, the program is read inte memory,
</p>
<p>
Between entry of the required program name and # suc!
name match, the command may be terminated by first stopping the
cassette tape recorder and then typing four ESC (SHIFTIENTER)
characters. Four consecutive ESC characters read from cassette
tape will have the same effect.

The command will also recognise as program names, any file
names written using the SYS-EX &ldquo;w&rdquo; command. If a file which is
not a BASIC program file matches with the required nane and is,
read into memory, it may be necessary to RESET the computer and
to cold start BASIC once again. (NAS-SYS J")
