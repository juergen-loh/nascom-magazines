Naspen Extension from BLL (&pound;15 disk or tape?
</p>
<p>
I only have the tape version of this but find it solves some
of the gripes of Naspen. Generally, it is claimed to be faster
in most commands but more spefically on the tine consuming block
inserts, etc. A nice touch is character AGH which displays asa
triangle but prints as @ space to keep blocks on one line. Eg
equations. New commands includer&mdash;
</p>
<p>
block delete
</p>
<p>
and additions to the find command liker
</p>
<p>
ro replace
</p>
<p>
9&rsquo; global (replace all) &ndash; designed to help bad spoolers
lyke mee
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;T) op kill &ndash; deletes all before cursor
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;HERE IS A CAPS LOCK WHICH IS HANDY
</p>
<p>
Ur&rsquo; can unwrap the display which I prefer to use on
difficult formatting problems
</p>
<p>
3&rsquo; command can now fail safe, and
*O&rsquo; will overide the stop print character
</p>
<p>
The cursor stays on screen in nearly all situations now,
</p>
<p>
which d= an improvement, but the cursor also goes past the end
</p>
<p>
Of the Line in Unwrap which makes it hard to see where the
insertion of spaces is.
</p>
<p>
The extension allows you to insert almost the whole
character set so that control characters can be dumped to. the
printer, but, in desperation at Naspen itself (which recodes
Some keys) I&rsquo;have had to modify buffer locations in Nas-Sys
Starting around 1021H to get the right characters quickly. Even
then, codes 1ike QQH and FFH must&rsquo; be avoided hich preclude:
some &lsquo;data bytes to my printer set-up facility. The real plus was
the re-discovery that &lsquo;i&rsquo; allows insertion of ESC which, with
ay printer, invokes all the fancy fants and highlights.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The disc version is by and large the same but sorts out all
the disc write commands transparently except that it asks for a
filename after the &ldquo;W&rdquo; command.
