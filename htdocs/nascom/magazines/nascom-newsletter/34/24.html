About software standards
</h3>
<p class="noindent">
1) I am writing in response to your plea for comments on Mr.
O&rsquo;Farrell article re:standardised extensions to Nas-Sys. I
agree entirely with hie motives in providing standard calls for
add-ons but I would like to suggest a few alterations to his
schene
</p>
<h4>
a) Graphic boards
</h4>
<p>
Rather than separate SCAL calls for line, circle, etc.,
would it not be better to use one SCAL GRAF and load up the
arguments and/or registers?
</p>
<h4>
b) Floating Point Handling
</h4>
<p>
Whilst floating point routines have been published in many
places, they are still not widely available to everyone.
</p>
<p>
I believe extended calls to Nas-Sys should include floating
point arithmetic and functions as well as perhaps extended
precision integers. In doing this it will turn Sys into s
&lsquo;software bus&rsquo; onto which can be tacked all manner of language
and arithmetic applications.
</p>
<h4>
c) Nas-Sys (COM) Naughties
</h4>
<p>
Many moons ago, in the days when Z**l&rsquo;s weren&rsquo;t around,
there was an article in INMC (<a href="../text/"></a>issue&nbsp;5 or&nbsp;6 I think) entitled
&lsquo;Nas-Sys Naughties&rsquo;. The purpose of it was to ward off people
making direct calls to Nas-Sys as they had done with the
Nas-Bugs. May I now suggest another naughty &ndash; Direct Keyboard
Scans!!!
</p>
<p>
Many games programs and certain languages, ie BASIC and BLS
Pascal, scan the keyboard directly. (BLS Pascal even makes a
direct call to Nas-Sys). This practice is all very well and good
on a Nascom but it is perfectly possible to run Sys on a Gemini
by fudging the video RAM (see Richard Beal&rsquo;s program in 80-Bus
News).
</p>
<p class="noindent">
So, in conclusion, I would repeat my wish that Sys should act as
a &lsquo;software bus&rsquo; running the &lsquo;hardware bus&rsquo; we all know.

2) The proposal by Mr. O&rsquo;Farrell in the Nascom Newsletter Vol.3,
No.1 was a very good idea. A lot of people have already added
new routines to their Nas-Sys. I know that Polydos uses its own
set of new routine numbers and I think that Nasdos does the
same. It would be nice if we could get some standard out of it.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
But I think that there is another problem. Where in memory
should these extra routines be placed? Somewhere in the top of
memory most people would say, but I think that this is only half
a solution. Why not place the whole monitor on another page?
This is what I have done. Nas-Sys is placed on G803 EPROM
board (but I think that it should be a simple matter to modify
the CPU-board such that it could be paged in and out). The
monitor pages itself in and out when Nas-Sys routines are
