<p>
best known of these is the
<?php externalLink("UCSD Pascal","UCSD"); ?>
system, a particular feature of which
is to maximise the portability of software between different
computers. UCSD can be run on a number of much larger computer
systems as well as on 16 and 8 bit microcomputers, which illustrates
its flexibility.
</p>
<p>
UCSD is most frequently referred to with its implementation of the
Pascal programming language, but in fact other languages such as BASIC
and Fortran are also available. A certain amount of applications
software is also available.
</p>
<p>
UCSD has been implemented on the Nascom by Mike York, and we have
recently taken delivery of a copy. UCSD is completely new to me, and
the previously mentioned shortage of time has prevented any serious
usage yet. However, it looks very interesting and I look forward to
using it and commenting again in the future. Initial reactions are
that it is very different from the other operating systems on the
Nascom, and requires rather a lot of disc grinding to get started! It
is quite easy to install &ndash; replace NAS-SYS (or the CP/M boot EPROM)
with Mike&rsquo;s ingenious ALLBOOT EPROM, fit a CP/M MD PROM and header (if
not already fitted) and away you go. You can also run it in a
switchable system with NAS-DOS using the switch unit described above.
A drawback tor some users will be the price &ndash; typically several
hundred pounds tor the operating system and a language.

THE MANOR DATABASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
</h2>
<p>
MANOR is a versatile, low cost data management program designed to run
with computers fitted with the NAS-DOS operating system. In the 18
months or so of its use it has proved one of the most popular of the
NAS-DOS applications programs &ndash; perhaps because there are so many uses
for a program of this type. The current release is Rev 6, and all
registered owners should have a copy of this version, since a free
update service is included covering a 12 month period. If you have
not received the update, and you have registered the product, please
write in giving the serial number, date and place of purchase.
Although our system should catch those who register the earlier
versions after the release of the new one, it does occasionally fail
to do so.
</p>
<p>
One bug has been reported in the HINTON initialisation program of the
current Rev 6 of MANOR. This only affects the CHange option when this
is used to swap the fields round so that the first (or key) field is
changed. The fix for this bug has the rather nice feature that not
only does it now work (I hope!) but it is shorter and faster than the
original. To make the corrections type the following:
