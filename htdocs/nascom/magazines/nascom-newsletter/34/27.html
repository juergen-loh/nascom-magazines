4 common problem with micros is their lack of speed and
accuracy when it comes to calculations. For the average user,
the fact that @ figure is only accurate to the 6th decimal place
may be rather trivial but mhen it comes to complex graphics
Calculations or financial formulae the effects can be compounded
to make the figures unacceptable. Also, when calculating
trigonometric functions in a program, (commonly used in graphics
plots again) speed is very important. The time taken to
Calculate the LOG of @ nunber is horrendous when compared to the
rest of the program. One way round this is to use Took up tabli
but this uses up a lot of memory and isn&rsquo;t very accural
</p>
<p>
The answer, as far as the Nascom is concerned, has come in
the fora of the Belectra HGA-G8B Arithmetic Processor board.
</p>
<p>
The board (or at least the one 1 loaned for review
arrived well packaged and in silver paper. I alec
received a rather thin manual and a data booklet on the ANISI10
procwasor (the heart of the board), The board isn t a full size
8x8 board but it is blue. (This seems to be coming the Nascom
industry standard colour.) The board doesn&rsquo;t look
</p>
<p>
some of the other Nascom boards available but it wat
and who cares if it doesn&rsquo;t look pretty anyway.
</p>
<p>
Even for {ts small size, the board is only sparsely
populated and at &pound;199 you may wonder what you are paying for
The answer is, the AN9511 processor. It does account&rsquo; for a
rather large chunk of the total cost.
</p>
<p>
The board is supplied ready wired to a default port and with
a default clock speed hich most users should not need&rdquo; to
Change. However, by means of wire links, you Can select which
tno ports you want to address&rdquo; the board on (e@/@iH, 98/91H,
AD/AiH, BB/BIH, CQ/CIH, D@/DIH, EQ/EIH or FO/FIH) and&rsquo; you may
have tO change the link on the clock speed ic you are running @
2H: Nascom. Clean, simple and straight-forward. The board doe
not support DBDR so it is incompatible with the Nascom&nbsp;1 which
seems @ shane with so many still being in use.
</p>
<p>
The arithmetic processor works totally independently of the
Nascom 789 and is acc via 21/0 porte. To use the processor
couldn t be simpler. The 9511 contains a stack, @ command
register and a status register. The data to be operated on is
firstly pushed onto the stack (always least significant byte
first); @ command byte i@ sent to the command register (eg.
le-bit multiply &ndash; 6EH), the Nascom then waits for the arithneic
to finish (by testing the status port) and then it reads the
result from the stack port again (most significant byte first
this time). One ewemple that they give in the manual f= a
follows!
