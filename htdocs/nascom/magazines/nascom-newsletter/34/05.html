may be used. The SYS-EX equivalent of MONITOR is to perform
warm start to SYS-EX. This may be achieved from BASIC in the
following way.
</p>
<p>
DOKE the SYS-EX warm start entry point into location 4100.
The warm start entry point is 000BH beyond the start of SYS-EX.
If SYS-EX is installed at B000H, the required BASIC command is
</p>
<p>
DOKE 4100,-20469 <span style="padding-left: 2em">(ie. B00BH = -20469)</span>
</p>
<p>
BASIC can now be left by calling the USR function. (eg.
PRINT USR(0)&nbsp;)
</p>
<p>
One example of the usefulness of this feature is when a
conversion between decimal and hexadecimal is required. In this
case, the procedure would be:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Leave BASIC using:
<p>
DOKE 4100,-20469 + PRINT USR(0)
</p>
</li>
<li>
Perform the conversion using &ldquo;d&rdquo; or &ldquo;h&rdquo;
</li>
<li>
Return to BASIC using NAS-SYS &ldquo;Z&rdquo;.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you put SYS-EX into EPROM and set the hardware jump to
start SYS-EX, then a press of the RESET button will take you
straight from BASIC to SYS-EX. As this performs a cold start,
the screen will also be cleared.
</p>
<p>
Now for something for Z80 assembler programmers. An earlier
part mentioned that all of the SYS-EX routines may be called
from an assembler program. The available routines are all of
the keyboard commands plus 9 further commands. All routines are
called by calling the same entry point within SYS-EX (3 bytes on
from the start of the monitor extension). The byte following
the call instruction should contain the required routine number.
In the case of the keyboard commands, the routine number is the
ASCII code of the lower case letter. Routines start at 61H
(&ldquo;a&rdquo;). The 9 additional routines are numbered 7BH through
83H.
</p>
<p>
Parameters required for a called command are set up in the
NAS-SYS arguments before the command is called. Commands do not
preserve the contents of registers AF, BC, DE, HL, so the user
must save any values required. If, on return from calling a
SYS-EX routine, the Carry flag is set ON, an error condition has
been detected and the command may not have been completed.
</p>
<p>
The 9 routines which are available only by calling from an
assembler program are now described.
