may be used. The SYS-EX equivalent of MONITOR is to perform
warm start to SYS-EX. This may be achieved fron BASIC in the
following way.
</p>
<p>
DOKE the SYS-EXx warm start entry point inte Jocation 4100.
The warm start entry point is Q@QBH beyond the start of SYS-EX.
14 SYS-EX is installed at BO@H, the required BASIC command is
</p>
<p>
DOKE 4100,-20469 (ie. B00BH = -20469)
</p>
<p>
BASIC can now be left by calling the USR function. (eg.
PRINT USR(@? &gt;
</p>
<p>
One example of the usefulness of this feature is shen
conversion between decimal and hexadecimal ia required. In this
case, the procedure mould bet
</p>
<p>
1, Leave BASIC using:
DOKE 4100,-20469 + PRINT USR(G!
</p>
<p>
2. Perform the conversion using &ldquo;d&rdquo; or &ldquo;h&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
3. Return to BASIC using NAS-SYS &ldquo;2&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
1f you put SYS-EX into EPROM and set the hardware jump to
start SYS-EX, then # press of the RESET button will take you
Straight from BASIC to SYS-EX. As this performs a cold starty
the screen will also be cleared.

Now far something for 760 assembler programmers. An earlier
part mentioned that all of the SYS-EX routines may be called
from an assembler program. The available routines are all of
the keyboard commands plus 9 further commands. All routines are
called by calling the Same entry point within SYS-EX (3 bytes on
from the start of the monitor extention). The byte following
the call instruction should contain the required routine number.
In the case of the keyboard commands, the routine number is the
ASCIT code of the lower case Routines start at 61H
&ldquo;1, The 9 additional routines are numbered 75H through
ast.
</p>
<p>
Parameters required for 2 called command are set up in the
NAS-SYS arguments before the command is called. Commands do not
preserve the contents of registers AF, BC, DE, ML, so the user
must save any values required. If, on return from calling #
SYS-EX routine, the Carry flag is set ON, an error condition has
been detected and the command may not have been completed.
</p>
<p>
The 9 routines which are available only by calling from an
mbler program are now described.
