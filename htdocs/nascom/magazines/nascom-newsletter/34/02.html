In the last {asue we completed the detailed description of
the SYS-EX keyboard commands and promised that a description of
the SYS-EX BASIC routines would follow in the next issue. Well,
here is the next issue and we begin with the SYS-EX BASIC
routin
</p>
<p>
To recap briefly, SYS-EX provides an alternate set of
commands to. the GK&rsquo; &ldquo;BASICS CSAVE, CLOAD and CLOAD?. These
comm Tow program names to be up to 42 characters long. The
commands allow access to tape labele written using the SVS-EX
&ldquo;1&rdquo; command. The commands are fully compatible with CSAVE, CLOAD
and CLOAD? and programs saved with one set of commands can be
Fecognised and read using the other set of command:
</p>
<p>
The SYS-EX BASIC named file and label commands are called by
using the USR function. Prior to using USR, the start of the
SYS-EX BASIC routines should be DOKE d into memory. The BASIC
entry point in SYS-EX is located @1EQH beyond the start of
SYS-EX. When the monitor extension is installed at the
recommended memory address (B000H to BFFFH) the required BASIC
statement is)
</p>
<p>
DOKE 4108,-20000 (ie. BIEQH = -20000 decimal)
</p>
<p>
As SYS-EX is fully relocatable, you may have decided to put
it at a different menory address. If so, just add @1EQH to the
hex start of SYS-EX then convert this to decimal using the &ldquo;h&rdquo;
command. You wont get the nice easy to remenber number
(=20000), but it will work just the sam
</p>
<p>
The routines may be called by # statement such as PRINT
USRin) Or 7USRin) or T=USRin). Even though a PRINT statement
or an assignnent statement is used, nothing will be printed&rdquo; or
assigned to a variable on completion of the SYS-EX. commands.
This is because SYS-EX warm starts BASIC when it finishes
command. (ie. it does not just return to BASIC)
