appears on the next screen line and the required program name is
entered. The action of the command is identical to the READ
NAMED PROGRAM FILE command, with the exception that the required
program is NOT loaded into memory. The command is used to check
that a program file may be successfully read from cassette tape.

<h3>
SEARCH FOR TAPE LABEL &ndash; USR(2)
</h3>
<p>
Read a cassette tape and search for a tape label as written
by the SYS-EX &ldquo;l&rdquo; command. Display the first label found on the
top line of the screen then terminate the commend.
</p>
<p>
The command may be used for positioning a tape
prior to using the WRITE NAMED PROGRAM FILE command. The tape
drive LED is switched on between entry of the command and
command termination. If a tape label is not found, the command
may be terminated by first stopping the cassette tape recorder
and then typing four ESC (SHIFT:ENTER) characters. Four
consecutive ESC characters read from the cassette tape recorder
will have the sane effect.

<h3>
<span class="uppercase">
Write Named Program File</span> &ndash; USR(3) (CSAVE equivalent)
</h3>
<p>
Write the BASIC program currently in memory to cassette
tape. The program is preceded bye file label containing the
specified program name, The file label will be recognised and
displayed in full by the SYS-EX commands &ldquo;q&rdquo;, &ldquo;r&rdquo; and &ldquo;v&rdquo; in
addition to the WRITE and VERIFY NAMED PROGRAM FILE commands.
The BASICs CLOAD and CLOAD? commands will also recognise the
file label, but will use and display only the first character of
the program name.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
After entry of the USR(3) statement, the prompt

wName:

<p class="continued">
appears on the next screen line and the name of the program to
be written is entered on that line. The tape drive LED is then
switched on and, after a short delay, the file label followed by
the file itself is sent to the serial output port for writing to
tape. Finally, the tape drive LED is switched off.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
NB.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to escape from the above commands while the
file name prompt is displayed on the screen. (ie. rNamer:, vName:
+ wName:) To do this, backspace over the prompt or move the
cursor to another line before pressing ENTER. An error message
will be produced, but no harm will be done.

<h3>
RETURNING TO SYS-EX FROM BASIC
</h3>
<p>
It is useful to have an equivalent of the MONITOR command
which, instead of returning solely to NAS-SYS, returns to SYS-EX
so that the full range of NAS-SYS and SYS-EX keyboard commands
