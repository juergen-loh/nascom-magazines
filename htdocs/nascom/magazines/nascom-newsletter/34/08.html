The design for the tight pen evolved becaise of my reed for a
device that would allow me to select voutines from merus of rotines:
Some of these routines were to bo used to input. dots by sing the

that would permit the definition af envelope shapes Sy drawing &ldquo;he
envelope shapes directly cn to the screen it seemed that a light pen
would be the most obviows device *o ise and so 1 losied. ta veric
