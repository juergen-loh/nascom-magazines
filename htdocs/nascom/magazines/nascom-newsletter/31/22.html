Micro Power 64K RAM Board Review

<p>
I had deliberately waited several months after it was first
announced so that, firstly, any bugs would be ironed out before
1 bought one, and&rsquo; secondly, so that I could read the review of
it that was promised in Micropower. Unfortunately, not all. the
bugs had been found (or they had been left in deliberately to
make life more interesting?) and the promised review did) not
Appear. Perhaps it was thought that there was not enough
interest in the board &ndash; there probably aren&rsquo;t too many
Unexpanded Nascom around now 1 suppose. However, this board
makes an ineipensive way to add Sak of RAM and a PCG to a Nascom
1 &ndash; total cost about &pound;100. (A Nascom&nbsp;2 does not require the
buffer board to be populated and the cost ts about &pound;85.)
</p>
<p>
The PCB itself is af the highest quality and is worth every
penny of the &pound;45 &ndash; except for one small point &ndash; there is a small
Piece of track missing, about half an inch long, on the
Underside of the buffer board section near to the Nasbus
connectors. It should connect fram the track coming from B17 pin
Sto the Nasbus. Not only does this mess up the addressing of
the menory but it also causes havoc with the I/O (ie. keyboard&rsquo;)
since the missing track means that AS is not connected to Ba,
the port decoder. You can imagine what fun I had trying to sort
that out. This is the only PCB error I found, however, I noticed
during ay investigations into the track Layout&rsquo; that the DMA
daisy chain does not appear to have been implemented (not that
it really matters to most people). Instead of going to Nasbus
pin 17, /BAO is connected to /BAl near to BIS.

<p>
On the whole, the manual supplied with the board is very
good with clear explanations of the hardware. For those of us
Sith a nervous disposition, do not put the tantalum capacitors
in the board the way the instructions say. This results in your
lovely new &amp;4k board exuding several puffs of smoke and&rdquo; an
obnoiious smell of fried tantalum capacitors! This brings back
memories of the Nascom 3A power supply &ndash; funny how these
designer chaps don"t know their +&rsquo;s from their -"s.

<p>
The instructions for fitting 6116&rdquo; to the PCG seem urang to
me &ndash; hen fitting one 6116 it should be fitted at Gl, not GS,
Dtherwise it is uitting on top of the 6576. Also, the
instructions say that when fitting two 6116"= to get a full 4h
of programmable graphics, the links LI and L2 should be set up
as for 41ia&rsquo;s. Ithink this is wrong and they should be as
Gescribed for the 6116. Details are given for switching in the
extra 6116 via G/. This disables the 6576. An alternative method
is to keep the &amp;576 enabled and select between 61le&rsquo;= by taking
66 pin 12 high or low.
</p>
<p>
The explanation of the memory mapper is, on the whole, clear
but I would have liked to know how to map the PCG at G00&rdquo; which
at the moment I can not see how ta do. Also the method given for
