within HINTON to allow existing files to be changed without
feeding to create new ones.
</p>
<p>
I would again remind users that copying a file structure is
better accomplished using FILCPY than the CReate command of
HINTON, particularly since some users have experienced problems
with the latter!

Rev 6 should be issued by mid-March to all existing users
WHO HAVE REGISTERED &ndash; copies will not be issued to anyone who
has not returned the registration form. This will, however,
have to be the last free update issued to users of copies of
MANOR sold before July 1982 we have already extended the free
update service beyond that originally offered, and updates are
largely improvements rather than corrections to errors.

EXTENDED BASIC
</h4>
<p>
All the versions (tape, NAS-DOS and CP/M) of this are now
available. Versions including the graphics commands for us
with the AVC are provided on the same tape/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>disc as the normal
version as standard.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that the existing version of XBASIC 3.1T
has an error in the printer routine (device 1) &ndash; the AF register
is not saved before checking the status of the handshake line,
and a SCAL 6F is used to drive the printer instead of SCAL 6E.
As you cannot easily patch this in the available space we
suggest that you use your normal printer driver (or see the
listing in AN-0006 in this issue) and insert the address of this
routine at 3B32. Remember that you should not put the driver at
0C80 for XBASIC, as this is the keyboard input buffer, and that
if you put it at the tap of memory you should use a CLEAR
statement to protect it from BASIC.

NAS-NET &ndash; NETWORKING FOR NASCOM COMPUTERS
</h4>
<p>
Networking allows several computers to share the disc and
printer resources of one of their number. Where several
computers are used together &ndash; such as in education &ndash; this can
result in significant savings. NAS-NET is a system for Nascom
computers which achieves this objective. NAS-NET has been in
use for over 6 months in several sites, and so can be regarded
as a well proven system. More information is given in the
advertisment elsewhere in the Newsletter.

USE OF PRINTERS WITH NASCOM&nbsp;2 AND 3
</h4>
<p>
We probably receive more enquiries relating to the use of
printers with the Nascom than on any other subject. The
hardware and software implications of using various types of
printer with the Nascom are described in Application. Note AN-0006,
which is reproduced below.
