within HINTON to allow existing files to be changed without
feeding to create new ones.
</p>
<p>
I would again remind users that copying a file structure is
better accomplished using FILCPY than the CReate command of
HINTON, particularly since some users have experienced problems
with the latter?

Fev &amp; should be issued by mid-Harch to all existing users
WHO HAVE REGISTERED &ndash; copie will not be issued to anyone whe
has not returned the registration form. This will, however,
have to be the last free update issued to users of Copies oF
MANOR sold before July 1982 we have already extended the free
Update service beyond that originally offered, and updates are
largely improvements rather than corrections to errors.

EXTENDED BASIC
</p>
<p>
All the versions (tape, NAS-DOS and CP/M) of this are now
avarlable. Versions including the graphics commands for us
with the AVC are provided on the same tape/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>dise as the normal
Version as standard.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that the existing version of XBASIC 3.17
has an error in the printer routine (device 1) &ndash; the AF register
fs not. saved before checking the status of the handshake line,
and @ SCAL GF :: used to drive the printer instead of SCAL 6E.
As you cannot easily patch this in. the available space we
suggest that you use your normal printer driver (or see the
Tisting in AN-0008 in this issue) and insert the address of this
routine at SB52. Remember that you should nat put the driver at
Ocdo for XBASIC, as this is the keyboard input buffer, and that
tf you put it at the tap of memory you should use a&rdquo; CLEAR
Statement to protect it from BASIC.

NAS-NET &ndash; NETWORKING FOR NASCOM COMPUTERS
</p>
<p>
Networking allows several computers to share the disc and
printer resources of one of their number. Where several
Computers are used together &ndash; such as in education &ndash; this cal
result in significant savings. NAS-NET 15 a system for Nascom
Computers which achieves this objective. NAS-NET has been in
tse for aver 6 months in several sites, and so can te regarded
ea well praven system. More information is given in the
