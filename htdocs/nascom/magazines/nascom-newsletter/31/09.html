Disassembler Part II

Welcome to Part II &ndash; I hope that you managed to struggle
through Part I alright, but don&rsquo;t worry, it can only get worse.
By now you should have your print routine working to your
satisfaction &ndash; called PROIS.
</p>
<p>
Now there are 9 subroutines to write, yes 9! and also a lot
of data. One of these, is a sort of controller, and calls one of
the remainder depending upon the data it is fed. A great deal of
the disassembler is a great deal of data, organised into
tables.
</p>
<p>
I will define the control routines;
</p>
<dl class="indent justify">
<dt>
i)</dt><dd>On entry HL&rsquo; contains a pointer to some data. This holds
the routine number to which control will pass. This
routine number is held in the least 3 significant bits
(0, 1, 2) so ANDing the contents of HL&rsquo; [ie (HL&rsquo)] with 7
will give this number. Don&rsquo;t forget to increment HL&rsquo; to
point to the next piece of valuable data.
</dd>
<dt>
ii)</dt><dd>Bits 3, 4 and 5 may contain data that the called
subroutine will need, though not the only data it may
need. Consequently the data byte [ie (HL&rsquo;) before
incrementing!!] must be put somewhere &ndash; just in case.
</dd>
<dt>
iii)</dt><dd>Bit 7 of this data byte is used as a sort of &lsquo;stop&rsquo; flag.
If it is not set the CONTROL will loop back on itself in
order to call the next routine. If it is set then CONTROL
will break out of the loop, call PRDIS and then move onto
the next op-code to be disassembled.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Obviously HL&rdquo; must contain the correct address. This is
achieved by creating a table of twelve addresses, corresponding
to the 12 combinations of TYPE and F. Let me explain, TYPE
represents whether the instruction to be disassembled began with
&pound;ED, &pound;CB or neither. It can only have 3 possible values &ndash; use 0,
1 and 2 because life is so much easier. F will hold bits 6 and 7
of the instruction being disassembled. Therefore, it has 4
possible values. Hence 12 combinations. There should be an
address in your table for each possible case. Get it into HL&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
This should cause no problems if you order your table
correctly. For example: (and may I recommend this method)
</p>
<table class="indent2">
<tr><td style="padding-right: 2em">TAPST</td><td style="padding-right: 2em">TYPE = 0</td><td style="padding-right: 2em">F = 0</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>TYPE = 0</td><td>F = 1</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>TYPE = 0</td><td>F = 2</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td colspan=2 style="text-align: center">-----"-----</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>TYPE = 2</td><td>F = 3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Now the first byte of each address is given by TABST + (2 x
