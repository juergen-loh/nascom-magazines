the port decoding seems incomplete. It iz necessary to connect
/TOEXT as well as /NASIO to the lowest decode of B4 (ie. pin 9)
otherwise the Nascom&nbsp;1 on-board port decoder will not be
encoded. (At the moment I am not clear as to why /I0EXT and
YNOSIO are seperated on the buffer board.) It is possible to use
the on-board PIO by using a circuit by Mr. D. Ritchie, published
in INMC.

<p>
The values of the electrolytic power supply decoupling
capacitors are not given anywhere, nor is there any information
pn getting the extra data and address signals out of the Nascom
1 video circuitry. However, this information is available in
Micropower, Vol. 1, No. 1 in the article by Mr. 5. Hope, but
note that the connectors to pins 10 and 14 of the character
Generator socket must be swapped over.

Actual construction is quite straight-forward. used
sockets throughout&rsquo; despite the warning in the manual. The
Silk-screened Legends for the R&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s are a little ambiguous
tn places. There is a small amount of handwiring to do &ndash; mainly
betneen the address lines and the PCG, and few to add from the
memory mapper. I used verowire with the combs glued to the
outside edge of the board to guide the wires.

<p>
Overall then, a good quality product allowing one to expand
a Nascom to 64k at a very reasonable price. Unfortunately, it
took me a while to get mine going due solely to errors in&rsquo; the
documentation and on the PCE itself. At least I know more about
fay Nascom now than I did before 1 started building the PCB.
