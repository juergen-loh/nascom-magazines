the port decoding seems incomplete. It is necessary to connect
/IOEXT as well as /NASIO to the lowest decode of B4 (ie. pin 9)
otherwise the Nascom&nbsp;1 on-board port decoder will not be
encoded. (At the moment I am not clear as to why /IOEXT and
/NASIO are seperated on the buffer board.) It is possible to use
the on-board <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> by using a circuit by Mr. D. Ritchie, published in
<a href="../../../../inmc-80-news/03/14/text/#article1">INMC</a>.

<p>
The values of the electrolytic power supply decoupling
capacitors are not given anywhere, nor is there any information
on getting the extra data and address signals out of the Nascom&nbsp;1
video circuitry. However, this information is available in
<a href="../../../../micropower/11/02/text/#article1">Micropower, Vol. 1, No. 1</a>
in the article by Mr. S. Hope, but
note that the connectors to pins 10 and 14 of the character
generator socket must be swapped over.

<p>
Actual construction is quite straight-forward. I used
sockets throughout despite the warning in the manual. The
silk-screened legends for the R&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s are a little ambiguous
in places. There is a small amount of handwiring to do&nbsp;&ndash; mainly
between the address lines and the PCB, and few to add from the
memory mapper. I used verowire with the combs glued to the
outside edge of the board to guide the wires.

<p>
Overall then, a good quality product allowing one to expand
a Nascom to 64k at a very reasonable price. Unfortunately, it
took me a while to get mine going due solely to errors in the
documentation and on the PCB itself. At least I know more about
fay Nascom now than I did before I started building the PCB.
