NEWS FROM NASCOM
</h1>
<p>
In future we intend to divide the news from Nascom into
three main section# &ndash; new products, news of existing products
and technical tips.
</p>
<p>
This month&rsquo;s newsletter includes a brief description of the
Lucas Nascoa LX and the SPEX word processing package. A few
notes on the use of some existing software packages follow, and
we finish with an article on using various printers with the
Nascom a subject on which we regularly receive requests for
information.
</p>
<p>
We did promise in the last issue an article on the AVC, but
we are now holding this over for the next issue, due to shortage
of space.

<p>
We have recently changed our arrangesents for dealing with
customer enquiries.&rdquo; As before your first contact should be with
your dealer, but if you do need&rsquo; to contact us direct ask for the
Sales Department for price/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>availability/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>literature, or the
Customer Service Deck for technical or maintenance information,
Please make cure that you know the serial number of any purchase
fon which you have a query. I must emphasise the importance of
returning registration forms &ndash; an amazing nuaber of people Jo
not bother, and they are of course the ones who don"t receive
Gutomatic &ldquo;product information updates or, in the case of some
software products, revised releases when&rsquo; these are issued
Since seftware is easily pirated (not of course by the people
who read this magazine) we insist on serial numbers being quated
in the case of software queries.
</p>
<p>
In the next issue we will have the article on the AVC and
its support software. We will also give a description of how to
pravide a buffered keyboard, giving the ability te type in while
the computer is calculating, at a cost of about 2p!
