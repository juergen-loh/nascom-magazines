NEWS FROM NASCOM
</h1>
<p>
In future we intend to divide the news from Nascom into
three main sections &ndash; new products, news of existing products
and technical tips.
</p>
<p>
This month&rsquo;s newsletter includes a brief description of the
Lucas Nascom LX and the SPEX word processing package. A few
notes on the use of some existing software packages follow, and
we finish with an article on using various printers with the
Nascom a subject on which we regularly receive requests for
information.
</p>
<p>
We did promise in the last issue an article on the
<?php externalLink("AVC","",""); ?>,
but we are now holding this over for the next issue, due to shortage
of space.
</p>
<p>
We have recently changed our arrangements for dealing with
customer enquiries. As before your first contact should be with
your dealer, but if you do need to contact us direct ask for the
Sales Department for price/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>availability/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>literature, or the
Customer Service Desk for technical or maintenance information.
Please make sure that you know the serial number of any purchase
on which you have a query. I must emphasise the importance of
returning registration forms &ndash; an amazing number of people do
not bother, and they are of course the ones who don&rsquo;t receive
automatic product information updates or, in the case of some
software products, revised releases when these are issued.
Since software is easily pirated (not of course by the people
who read this magazine) we insist on serial numbers being quoted
in the case of software queries.
</p>
<p>
In the next issue we will have the article on the AVC and
its support software. We will also give a description of how to
provide a buffered keyboard, giving the ability to type in while
the computer is calculating, at a cost of about 2p!

1. NEW PRODUCTS
</h3>
<h4 class="indent2">
THE LUCAS NASCOM Lx MODEL
</h4>
<p>
Those of you who went to the &lsquo;Which Computer?&rsquo; exhibition
will have seen the new Lucas Nascom LX model. This is a new
style of packaging intended to make the appearance of the
machine more attractive to the business user. It is an
additional model rather than a replacement for any existing
product. The internal electronics are similar to that used in
Nascom&nbsp;2/3. We will be giving more information on this in the
next issue.
