((TYPE x 4) + F)). Store the most significant byte first. Use a
couple of shift lefts to multiply by 2 and 4, and don&rsquo;t corrupt
anything!!. You may now send your Nascom off to CONTROL. But
wait!! The table of routine addresses is, as yet,
unconstructed.
</p>
<p>
This table will start with the address of routine 0 then 1,
2 etc, finishing with that of routine 7. CONTROL will work along
similar lines to the last routine described. You now want, OK
need, to know about the other routines. They are subroutines,
and as such MUST end with a RET (&pound;C9) instruction. This applies
to all of the routines 0 to 7.
</p>
<p>
Routine 0 &ndash; This is, in effect, a jump but depending on the
value held in H (not of HL fame). H can be 0 through 7. So a
table will need to be built directly after the &pound;00 byte calling
this routine. This table will be 16 bytes long and contain 8
addresses, corresponding to H=0, H=1 etc. Work out which address
is needed and then put it into HL&rsquo;. This will trick CONTROL into
effecting a very complex 8 way jump. Note that bit 7 of the
calling code for this routine must NEVER be set else when
CONTROL is returned to, it will think that has just finished the
last routine and not loop back to do our carefully prepared
jump. For some unknown reason this routine played havoc with my
disassembler. That is, until I remembered that Routine 0 is the
first routine &ndash; Not Routine 1.
</p>
<p>
If I might digress for a while to give a short analogy as to
what I see CONTROL as. CONTROL seems to be a microprocessor
itself. It has HL&rsquo; as its program counter. Bits 0, 1 and 2
represent the opcode, bits 3, 4 and 5 the data (if required).
Routines 0 to 7 are just units, black boxes if you like (you
haven&rsquo;t heard of the Black-Box Theory!!!), within the processor.
Routine 0 is just a complex jump instruction. Some of the other
routines are for handling lists. I hope this analogy is useful
to you. I know &ndash; Clear as mud!!!

<h3>
And now a description of Routine 1.
</h3>
<p>
Routine 1 &ndash; This routine will add a string of characters to
STRDIS. Don&rsquo;t forget the painter/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>marker system has to be
updated. The first character will be pionted to by HL&rsquo; and when
the routine is finished HL&rdquo; must point to the byte after the
last character that was added. Confused? I was, but if you can
do this properly then a lot of work (and RAM) is saved later on.
This routine can be compared to STRDIS-STRDIS+"xxxxxx" in BASIC.
Where xxxxxx is the literal string to be added. May I suggest
setting bit 7 of the last character of your literal? Thus, when
this is sensed your routine will know the last character.
Remember to reset bit 7 before adding to STRDIS.

<p>
For example
</p>
<p class="indent2">
01 41 42 43 C4 nn
</p>
<p class="continued">
will cause ABCD to be added to STRDIS, leaving HL&rsquo; pointing to
nn. C4 is ASCII for D, but with bit 7 set. What will
