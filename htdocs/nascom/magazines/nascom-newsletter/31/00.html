using compiling BASIC, it is very fast and addictive. Based on

drawing round reas of the screen. In the first phase you only
have to avoid being hit by the Dart when you are in the process
of drawing 2 line but in the second phase onwards you must avoid
being trapped by the Fuse which burns along the lines. as you
draw the. A different type of game to the standard. &lsquo;Invaders

A very useful tool for all BASIC programmers. Supplied
