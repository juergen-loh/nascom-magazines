NAS-DOS owners are catered for by the utilities included on
the utilities disc.

<p>
To enable the computer to recognise the handshake signal
when using printers requiring this, it is necessary to enter the
following routine in to a suitable memory location 0C8O using
the NAS-SYS monitor, or the equivalent POKE&rsquo;s from BASIC:
</p>
<p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-34-1.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
To access the printer from NAS-SYS, first enable this
routine by typing EC80 and then use the U command.
</p>
<p>
In BASIC the routine can be treated as follows (located at
X, where X=3200 for location 0C80 hex&nbsp;)
</p>
<p id="article1" class="indent">
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-34-2.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
In NAS-PEN the routine should be entered and enabled using
NAS-SYS; NASPEN should be cold started and then exited, and
location 101D modified using the command M101E DF 75. If the
NAS-PEN file is saved this modified printer vector is also
saved, although it is still necessary to enter the code and
initialise it.
</p>
<p>
NAS-DOS users are provided with the utility program UTS
which is loaded at the top of memory and allows printer output
to a self-contained routine of the type described above.
</p>
<h4>
3.3 Parallel printers with Centronics interface
</h4>
<p>
A suitable driver is included in the UTS file an the NAS-DOS
utilities disc. The coding for a suitable routine is attached.
The routine is used as the User output routine under NAS-SYS in
exactly the same way as described for the serial printer with
handshake.
</p>
<p>
In NAS-SYS the routine should be entered using the M
command, and enabled by the EC9B command.
</p>
<p>
From BASIC the procedure is as described above, except that
the range of the FOR loop should be 0 TO 50 and the DATA
statements should be as follows:
