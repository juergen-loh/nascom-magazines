NAS-DOS owners are catered for by the utilities
the utilities disc-included on
</p>
<p>
To enable the computer to recognise the handshake signal
when using printers requiring this, it is necessary to enter the
following routine in toa suitable memory location 0CBO using
the NAS-SYS monitor, or the equivalent POKE"s from BASIC:
</p>
<p>
ceo 21 98 of 22 78 OC DF 5B
0C89 FS DB 00 E6 80 25 FA Fi
0C90 DF 6E CF
</p>
<p>
To access the printer from NAS-SYS, first enable this
routine by typing &pound;C80 and then use the U command.
</p>
<p>
In BASIC the routine can be treated as follows (located at
X, where X=3200 for location OCB0 hex?
</p>
<p>
5 x=3200
10 FOR I =0 TO 10
20 READ A
</p>
<p>
30 POKE X + 1,8
40 NEXT
</p>
<p>
50 DOKE 3192,
60 DOKE 3187, (EM 1912 IF NAS-SYS&nbsp;3.
70 DATA 145, 219,0,230, 128, 40,250, 241
80 DATA 223,110,201
</p>
<p>
90 END
</p>
<p>
In NOS-PEN the routine should be entered and enabled using
NAS-SYS$ NASPEN should be cold started and then exited, and
location 101D modified using the command MIOIE DF 75. if the
NOS-PEN file is saved this modified printer vector is also
saved, although it is still necessary to enter the code and
Initialise it.
</p>
<p>
NAS-DOS users are provided with the utility program UTS
which is loaded at the top of memory and allows printer output
to a self-contained routine of the type described above
</p>
<p>
3.3 Parallel printers with Centronics interface
</p>
<p>
A suitable driver is included in the UTS file an the NAS-DOS
utilities disc. The coding for a suitable routine is attached.
The routine is used as the User output routine under NAS-SYS in
exactly the same way as described for the serial printer with
handshake.
</p>
<p>
In NAS-SVS the routine should be entered using the #
command, and enabled by the EC9B command.
</p>
<p>
From BASIC the procedure is as described above, except that
the range of the FOR loop should be 0 TO 50 and the DATA
Statements should be as follows:
