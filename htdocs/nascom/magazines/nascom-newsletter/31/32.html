connectors. Those making their own cable should use the standard
25-way D-type connectors and make the following connections:

<h4>
2.2 Serial printers with handshake
</h4>
<p>
These printers require the additional &lsquo;handshake&rsquo; line to be
connected in order that the printer can notify the computer when
printing is to be suspended pending emptying of the printer
memory. Normally your dealer will supply suitable connectors and
cables, but if you wish to make up your own you should follow
the instructions below.
</p>
<p>
The printer handshake may be either at a 5&nbsp;volt TTL level,
in the case of the Nascom Imp printer, or may be at 12 volt
RS232 levels. The connections to be made should be exactly as
described for the serial printer without handshake but with the
following additional connection.
</p>
<table style="width: 80%">
<tr><th>Computer<br>D-type<br><br></th><th>Function</th><th>Printery<br>D-type</th><th>From PL2<br>Pin</th></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Handshake at 12 volts</td><td>20</td><td>8</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Pin 8 of PL2 must be connected to TP3 on the main beard.
(Standard on all recent production Nascom&nbsp;2&rsquo; and 3&rsquo;s).
</p>
<p>
The handshake signal input must be limited to 5 volt TTL
levels, which is done as follows: (this connection is standard
all on current Nascom&nbsp;3&rsquo;s)
</p>
<p>
Connect pin 20 of the D-type socket in the computer to a 1K&nbsp;ohm
resistor, the other end of the resistor being connected to
the junction of 2 diodes (eg 1N4001). One of these diodes is
connected to the ground pin (7) and the other to the grey lead
from pin 8 of PL2; in both cases the cathode of the diode (the
end marked with a ring in most cases) is connected to the common
junction.

2.3 Parallel printer connections
</h4>
<p>
Once again your dealer should he able to supply suitable
cables and connectors, which will be made up according to the
data given below for those assembling their own connections.
