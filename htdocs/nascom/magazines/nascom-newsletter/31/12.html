For example if the byte given to CONTROL was &pound;24 (hex), 1
907010/100 and 6 was 2 then the routine should add D to STRDIS.

The first least 3 significant bits are the routine code,
next 3 up represent the list &ndash; as above.

Routine 5 &ndash; Easy, do Routine 4 but use H (not of ML fame)
instead of G. Go back and see what I did for Routine 3. Get the
idea?

Snowdinger 2 revisited.
This letter arrived from Mir. Kemplen, 2 Vicarage Close,
Menheniot, Liskeard, Cornwall about the Snowdinger 2 circuit.
caAfter an evenings work I produced @ circuit board and
added it to the machine. Great. Tt worked on tavulate and the
ddd machine code games that I have, so 1 loaded Basic and
tried again. Dismal failure I&rsquo;@ afraid. After about 50 seconds
the Basic crashes back to monitor...&rdquo;
any ideas. I&rsquo;ve sat and thought about it but I have not been
able to come up with any reason why it should work from Nas-sys.
and not basic. Mr. remplen is also offering a PCB for Snowdinger
2 so if you want one you should get in touch with hie
