<p>
For example if the byte given to CONTROL was &pound;24 (hex), ie
00/010/100 and G was 2 then the routine should add D to STRDIS.
</p>
<p>
The first least 3 significant bits are the routine code,
next 3 up represent the list &ndash; as above.
</p>
<p>
Routine 5 &ndash; Easy, do Routine 4 but use H (not of HL fame)
instead of G. Go back and see what I did for Routine 3. Get the
idea?
</p>
<p>
Well thats all for now, I don&rsquo;t want you all to end up by
going mental with frustration!! Remember that the disassembler
as a whole will hang around a) The main subroutines, b) Data and
c) Pointers. All must function perfectly. If they do then all
will go sweetly, If not then....

Snowdinger 2 revisited.
</h3>
<p class="noindent">
This letter arrived from Mir. Kemplen, _ ________ _____,
Menheniot, Liskeard, Cornwall about the Snowdinger 2 circuit.
</p>
<p class="indent">
"...After an evenings work I produced a circuit board and
added it to the machine. Great. It worked on tabulate and the
odd machine code games that I have, so I loaded Basic and
tried again. Dismal failure I&rsquo;m afraid. After about 30 seconds
the Basic crashes back to monitor.&nbsp;...&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="continued">
Any ideas. I&rsquo;ve sat and thought about it but I have not been
able to come up with any reason why it should work from Nas-sys
and not Basic. Mr. Kemplen is also offering a PCB for Snowdinger
2 so if you want one you should get in touch with him.
