use on the Nascom microcomputer. It can be used on any Nascom
1, 2 or 3 (or the LX) with NAS-SYS and tape or NAS-DOS and
discs. A minimum of 32K of user memory is required.
</p>
<p>
SPEX operates in two modes&nbsp;&ndash; command and edit. In command
mode a range of instructions is available allowing text data to
be loaded, saved, and printed. In the case of discs the
directory can also be listed and files may be deleted. In edit
mode text can be typed in and corrected. For initial use no
specialist knowledge is required&nbsp;&ndash; the machine will perform like
a normal typewriter. However, in addition to the normal
backspace key there are keys to move left, right, up and down
the screen, and by positioning the flashing cursor symbol at an
appropriate position corrections can simply be typed in. These
screen editing facilites are consistent with the normal Nascom
screen editor. Further commands are available to allow fast
scanning through the text, location of page boundaries, locating
and optionally changing each occurrence of a word or phrase,
etc.
</p>
<p>
Instructions can be included in a text file to fix paper and
margin widths, and these may be changed at will during entry of
the text. Text can be right justified or spread to fill the
exact width of paper specified. Facilities are included to
allow automatic centring of headings on a page and for making
use of bold face printing on printers equipped with this
facility.
</p>
<p>
Printing on paper can be initiated simply by typing PRINT in
command mode. Text will be formatted as specified by the width,
margin and other commands. Page boundaries are detected
automatically, and there 1s an option for stopping at the end of
each page (for sheet paper) or continuous printing (for
continuous stationery). A new page can be specified if required
by a command in the text file. In addition to printing the
entire text the print operation can be started from any required
point within the text file. Most types of printer can be used
with the SPEX program via the interfaces fitted as standard to
the Nascom computer
</p>
<p>
Many optional additional commands are provided to allow page
numbering, titling of pages, deletion of blocks of text, moving
or duplicating passages within the text, etc. A HELP command is
provided to assist the user, and to give access to more
specialised controls, such as setting double line spacing for
draft documents.

<p>
SPEX is an extremely powerful and versatile word processing
package, but one which it is also very easy to use. Although
tape version is available SPEX will probably be primarily of
interest to the disc user, who can load it very quickly. NAS-PEN
will continue to be available in EPROM and on disc, and is
of course supported by NAS-DOS.
