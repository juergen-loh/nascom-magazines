Introduction
</p>
<p>
Nascom microcomputers are designed to allow the use of a
wide range of different printers. The procedures used to connect
these different printers depend on the individual printer, but
can generally be divided into three groups.
</p>
<p>
1. Serial printers without handshake. Host slower printers
Fitted with a serial interface to S232, V24 or 20a &lsquo;current
loop standards can run continuously at their data transfer speed
&mdash;Vusually 300 baud (equivalent to 30 characters per second) +
Both Naxcom 2 and Naacom 3 have a suitable serial interface
</p>
<p>
fitted as standard.
</p>
<p>
2. Faster serial printers running at a data transfer rate of
1200 baud tequivalent to 120 characters per second) can accept
coded characters at this speed, but cannot continuously print
this fast. Instead they have an internal&rdquo; memory in which the
data is stored prior to printing. If the computer continues to
output characters at full speed the printer memory fills, and if
the printer could not tell the computer to wait some data would
be lout. Such printers are therefore normally fitted with an
additional connection, called the &lsquo;handshake&rsquo;line, which is
Connected to the computer ta notify the computer. when the
printer memory is full. @ connection is available on Nascom&nbsp;2
and 3 for this purpose, although an additional software routine
Ts required to support it.
</p>
<p>
3. Parallel interface. In this case instead of the code for
each character being sent serially along one wire a separate
wire is used for each code bit of the character. The interface
ts frequently referred to as a &ldquo;Centronics&rdquo; interface, ance it
has been widely used by one of the largest American specialist
printer manufacturers, Centronics. The uncommitted parallel
</p>
<p>
ports from the PIO fitted as standard to the Nascom&nbsp;2 and 3. can
be used to drive such printers.
</p>

Gut for those wishing to make up their own full details of the
connections required are given. If you Nave a suitable cable
then you should concentrate on &ldquo;the software details. These
software procedures are very easy to implement, although the
extensive description of all possible methods of use given in
thus note may make them appear rather more difficult. than is
actually the case.
