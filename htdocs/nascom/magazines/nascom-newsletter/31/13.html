For some years now, Nascom users have been fortunate in
having available to them one of the best machine code monitors
for micropracessors. The limits of memory mithin which Richard
Beale worked to write nas-sys&nbsp;1 &amp; 3 are now not as tight, in
view of the drop in memory prices over the last two years&rsquo; and
the ready availability of 4K machines at a reasonable price.
</p>
<p>
The Journal of the Nascom users is the proper place to start
a discussion on how such a @oniter ought now to be extended. We
bre no longer tied to tight memory constraints. Chris Blackmore,
tith his MONITOR.COM has shawn how Nas-sys can be adapted to run
Gn CP/M based systems. Nas-sys&nbsp;3 uses&rsquo; only &amp;3 of the 256
possible &ldquo;Sys calls, Extensions to &lsquo;Sys. were suggested
possible for the Nascom AVC card. Real Time Clocks can be
purchased or built to run off a pair of PIO ports. A number of
Bo-cotumn display cards are on the market. Three (more now)
colour display cards are currently available.
</p>
<p>
Each of these items needs driving software. Such software is
dependant on the particular hardware configuration used an the
object being driven. For example, my RIC circuit, homebrewed,
uses an inverted chip select to that written about by David Hunt
tn BO-Bus News No. 4. In consequence, I have to use&rsquo; (slightly?
different driving software which has to be eabedded in a program
or accensible in a standard way. T suggest that the standard way
for Nascom users should be through the calling conventions of
Nas-sye.
