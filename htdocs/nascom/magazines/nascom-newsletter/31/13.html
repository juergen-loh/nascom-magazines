For some years now, Nascom users have been fortunate in
having available to them one of the best machine code monitors
for microprocessors. The limits of memory within which Richard
Beale worked to write nas-sys&nbsp;1 &amp; 3 are now not as tight, in
view of the drop in memory prices over the last two years and
the ready availability of 64K machines at a reasonable price.
</p>
<p>
The journal of the Nascom users is the proper place to start
a discussion on how such a monitor ought now to be extended. We
are no longer tied to tight memory constraints. Chris Blackmore,
with his MONITOR.COM has shown how Nas-sys can be adapted to run
on CP/M based systems. Nas-sys&nbsp;3 uses&rsquo; only 63 of the 256
possible &rsquo;Sys calls. Extensions to &rsquo;Sys were suggested as
possible for the Nascom

card. Real Time Clocks can be
purchased or built to run off a pair of PIO ports. A number of
80-column display cards are on the market. Three (more now)
colour display cards are currently available.
</p>
<p>
Each of these items needs driving software. Such software is
dependant on the particular hardware configuration used an the
object being driven. For example, my RTC circuit, homebrewed,
uses an inverted chip select to that written about by David Hunt
in 80-Bus News No. 4. In consequence, I have to use (slightly)
different driving software which has to be embedded in a program
or accessible in a standard way. I suggest that the standard way
for Nascom users should be through the calling conventions of
Nas-sys.
