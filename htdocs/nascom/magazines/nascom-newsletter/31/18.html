used in place of the upper case letters. During the operation
of SYS-EX, all of the NAS-SYS keyboard Commands remain available
</p>
<p>
for use in the normal way. With the exception of the &ldquo;J&rdquo;, *h&rdquo;
and &ldquo;uw commands, all of the SYS-EX commands use the arguments
ARGI through ARGIO in the same way as does NAS-SYS. The &ldquo;d&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
command is a special case in that. the NAS-SYS arguments ARGL
through ARGIO are neither updated or used by the command.
Also, the single required argument for the &lsquo;d&rsquo; command may be in
2 format which is normally unsuitable as a command arguaent.
G.e. 8 minus sign and up to five digits are permitted.) The
&lsquo;h&rsquo; Command updates ARGI through ARGIO in the normal way,
however, the command itself will only recognise an argument
which 15 entered on the same line as the command. letter. The
&ldquo;ur command places value in ARGS, ARG&reg; or ARGIO without the
necessity of entering @, 9 or 10 values on a command line.
</p>
<p>
Certain SYS-EX commands require further input parameters to
be supplied after entry of the command line. The find (f")
command requires the entry of a find mask, while the remainder
Sf comands in this category require the entry of a file or a
tape label name.
</p>
<p>
Single step and non-maskable interrupt processing 15 in no
may altered by SYS-EX. However, after each of these facilities
has been used, control of keyboard input returns exclusively to
NAS-SYS. 1.e. the SYS-EX keyboard comands become temporarily
Unavailable until a SYS-EX warm or cold start is executed. The
Same situation applies when a program is ended by a breakpoint
or by a NAS-SYS MRET instruction. (-. or by the action of the
RESET button unless the hardware reset Jump is set to the
beginning of SYS-EX.)
</p>
<p>
A number of the features within SYS-EX have been designed
specifically with the Basic programmer in mind. Perhaps the
fost notable amongst these features are the routines which
provide enhanced alternatives to Basic"s CLOAD, CLOAD? and CSAVE
Commands. The SYS-EX routines not only permt program names up
to forty two characters in length, but also allow access ta tape
</p>
<p>
labels written using the SYS-EX &ldquo;I&rdquo; command. Program files
which are written using the SYS-EX routine wll be successfully
recognised and read by the standard Basic commands. Similarly,
</p>
<p>
program files which are written using the standard Basic comand
Will be successfully recognised and read by the SYS-Ex routines.
</p>
<p>
The routines which convert between decimal and hexadecimal
numbers are particularly useful when using the PEEK, POKE. DEE
and DOE commands in Basic. Both for memory addresses and cor
the values contained in particular memory locations, Basic uses
the decimal notation. However, much of the useful documentation
quotes values in hexadecimal- The SYS-EX &lsquo;d&rsquo; and &lsquo;h&rsquo; commands
provide easy methods of converting in either direction.
</p>
<p>
Other features will also prove useful to the Base
programmer. For example, the SYS-EX &ldquo;hk? command will in many
Circumstances be invaluable in suppressing the spurious. input
