NAS-SYS&nbsp;3A
</h4>
<p>
We are now using NAS-SYS&nbsp;3A instead of NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 in the
Nascom&nbsp;3. The only difference from NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 is that the OB2 80
is performed automatically to switch in the normal display
rather than the AVC in machines fitted with the AVC. If you
have NAS-SYS&nbsp;3, an AVC and the means to blow your own EPROM you
can change your existing NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 to 3A by making the following
changes:

CP/M AND NAS-DOS
</h4>
<p>
A number of users have asked for information about using
both NAS-DOS and CP/M on the same machine. The difficulty
arises of course from the need to change the memory map &ndash;
formally achieved by re-wiring the header plug LKS1. We
described in an Application Note (AN-0011) how this can be
achieved using a multi (8&nbsp;!!) way switch. A neater solution is
now provided by Business and Leisure, who are selling a small
PCB which mounts onte the board in place of LKS1 and the MD
PROM. This incorporates a number of relays, and it only needs a
two-pole switch to activate this board to switch from NAS-DOS to
CP/M. We have used this ourselves, and it is an Approved
Product. You can contact B &amp; L on ____ ______.

MANUALS
</h4>
<p>
After I wrote the section on manuals in the last newsletter
describing the new documentation some (person?) decided to
change the volume numbers! The corrected list now reads as
follows:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td style="padding-right: 1em">Volume</td><td>Contents</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>User manual &ndash; Intro&rsquo; to BASIC. Hardware manual, NAS-SYS&nbsp;3</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Graphics manual AVC software and hardware</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Personal data file</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Operating systems &ndash; Polysys, NAS-DOS, CP/M</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>System software &ndash; ZEAP, NAS-SEMBLER, Pascal</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Hardware options &ndash; RAM&nbsp;B. PSU, I/O board</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>NAS-DOS/NAS-SYS applications software</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>CP/M applications software</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
ALL these volumes and the individual manuals within them,
are available separately as are the binders. Your usual
supplier can give you further information and prices.
