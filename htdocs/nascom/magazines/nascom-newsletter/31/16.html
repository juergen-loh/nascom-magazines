<p>
Over the next few issues of the Nasco Newsletter, 2
description of the development and the contents of a 1K
rtension to NAS-SYS will be given. The monitor extension is
Galled SYS-EX and is fully compatible with both NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 and
NAS-SYS&nbsp;3. A full hex dump of SYS-EX will be printed in a
future issue of the magazine,
</p>
<p>
So what is SYS-EX and what does it do? In addition to the
normal NAS-SYS keyboard commands, SYS-EX uses twenty one of the
lower case letters of the alphabet to extend the range of
commands available. These commands plus an additional range of
routines may be cailed from assembler programs in a very similar
way to NAS-SYS routines. An added bonus for the users of Nascom
BF Basic, 15 the set of routines which allow you to use program
pames up ta forty two characters im length. The forty two
character names are completely compatible with the standard one
character names.
</p>
<p>
Wherever possible within SYS-Ex, the door has been left open
to allow further additions to the available facilities, Indeed,
without making any changes to the SYS-EX code or tables, it 15
Quite possible to define your own commands which can be called
by typing a single letter in the Same way as normal NAS-SYS.
commands. SYS-EX uses sts own internal table of routine
addresses which could, 1f required, be amended to &lsquo;customize&rsquo;
the monitor extension&rsquo; further. SYS-EX is written entirely in
relocatable code and the address table entries are all relative
addresses. SYS-EX does not require any ef its own workspace,
although Certain routines do make use of some of the fields
Within the standard NAS-SYS workspace.
</p>
<p>
The monitor extension can be loaded from tape and run in RAM
whenever required. However, the author has found it extremely
convenient to put SYS-EX inte EPROM (a single 2708 is ideal}
and set the hardware reset jump ( Nascom&nbsp;2) to cold start
SYS-EX at switch on.
