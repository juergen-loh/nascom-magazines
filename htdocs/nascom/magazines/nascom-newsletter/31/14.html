It will be simple enough to define certain SCAL numbers for
specific tasks, and to define the way they pass their
paraneters/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>results. For example, the RTC might be called using
Ghatever SCAL is defined for it with HL pointing to the area
Where the time/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>date is to be stored. The colour boards such as
the Plute or Climax might also avail to the &lsquo;Sys facilities in
that predefined graphics routines (Draw line, Circle,etc) might
be assigned &ldquo;Sys nuabers.
</p>
<p>
Implementation of each of these elementary functions.
(primitives?) will be system depentant of course. It mill be
necessary for each Nascoa owner ta do a little bit af work
building up the Library of routines to suit his own system, but
then that is done, programs can be interchanged between owners
in the knowledge that they will run on one machine or anather
Provided that the hast machine has all the facilities required.
Dbviously, one can not expect a program to read Day, Date and
Time on a&rsquo;machine that has not got a clock fitted, But one could
expect an error message and a safe return. Consider a. Pluta
omner wha sends a program to a Climax owner. Under the old
wachine cade system, the Pluto program hasn&rsquo;t a ghost of a
chance of running on the Climax. Using the suggested Extended
&ldquo;Gye, the program will be able ta rely on certain standard
primitives being available, It will not have to. concern itself
Mith the precise byte by byte structure of those primitives.
Instead, it will know (and &ldquo;use the word usefully&rdquo;) that
Circles are drawn by a particular SCAL number and lines by
another.

<p>
T hope that this letter will serve to provoke other Nascom
Users into considering this proposal &ndash;
</p>
<p>
This is something that has been in the back of my mind for
quite awhile now and as Me. O&rsquo;Farrell has put something in
</p>
<p>
writing, I would like to take the proposal further. Being. the
editor of this aagazine, I&rsquo;get to see a vast amount of ingenious
softnare and hardware ideas. Some of it is from professional
</p>
<p>
sources but the vast majority of the ideas come from private
Individuals who have applied some ingenuity and tmagination ta a
problem. I would life to propose that we set about creating a
Specification for anew standard of operating system for. the
Nascom computer. This would take into account most, 1f not all.
of the current hardware avaslable but also leave the doors open
for further expansion (speech and speech recognition, picture
recognition, etc). It would need ta support page mode Gemini
boards, MAP-G0 25k boards, ete) and it would also be nice to
see the facility to communicate with ather machines and possibly
additional processors.

<p>
Well, these are ay thoughts on the subsect. what are yours&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Get your pens out and start writing.
