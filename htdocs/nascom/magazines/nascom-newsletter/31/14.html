It will be simple enough to define certain SCAL numbers for
specific tasks, and to define the way they pass their
parameters/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>results. For example, the RTC might be called using
whatever SCAL is defined for it with HL pointing to the area
where the time/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>date is to be stored. The colour boards such as
the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?> or
<?php externalLink("Climax"); ?>
might also avail to the &rsquo;Sys facilities in
that predefined graphics routines (Draw line, Circle,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>etc) might
be assigned &rsquo;Sys numbers.
</p>
<p>
Implementation of each of these elementary functions
(primitives?) will be system depentant of course. It will be
necessary for each Nascom owner to do a little bit of work
building up the library of routines to suit his own system, but
then that is done, programs can be interchanged between owners
in the knowledge that they will run on one machine or another
provided that the host machine has all the facilities required.
Obviously, one can not expect a program to read Day, Date and
Time on a machine that has not got a clock fitted, but one could
expect an error message and a safe return. Consider a Pluto
owner who sends a program to a Climax owner. Under the old
machine code system, the Pluto program hasn&rsquo;t a ghost of a
chance of running on the Climax. Using the suggested Extended
&rsquo;Sys, the program will be able ta rely on certain standard
primitives being available. It will not have to concern itself
with the precise byte by byte structure of those primitives.
Instead, it will know (and use the word usefully) that
Circles are drawn by a particular SCAL number and lines by
another.

I hope that this letter will serve to provoke other Nascom
Users into considering this proposal.

This is something that has been in the back of my mind for
quite awhile now and as Mr. O&rsquo;Farrell has put something in
writing, I would like to take the proposal further. Being the
editor of this magazine, I get to see a vast amount of ingenious
software and hardware ideas. Some of it is from professional
sources but the vast majority of the ideas come from private
individuals who have applied some ingenuity and imagination to a
problem. I would life to propose that we set about creating a
specification for a new standard of operating system for the
Nascom computer. This would take into account most, if not all,
of the current hardware available but also leave the doors open
for further expansion (speech and speech recognition, picture
recognition, etc). It would need to support page mode Gemini
boards, MAP-80 256K boards, etc) and it would also be nice to
see the facility to communicate with other machines and possibly
additional processors.

Well, these are my thoughts on the subsect, what are yours?
Get your pens out and start writing.<br>
