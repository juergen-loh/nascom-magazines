2. Copy 48 characters from a specified mesory address to the
top line of the screen. The command is entered mith at least
</p>
<p>
one argument. The first. argusent entered is the memory
address from which 48 characters are copied to the top line
of the screen.
</p>
<p>
AAA &ndash; memory address from which 48 characters are copied.
</p>
<p>
Using the top line has always been a bit of a problem.
With the &lsquo;t&rdquo; command the top line can easily be used to hold
titles or any other text which is best not scrolled.

<p>
Set user routine address for the command
Sets up a specified value in one of the NAS-SYS arguments
</p>
<p>
RGB, ARG? or ARGIO.
The SYS-EX &ldquo;x&rdquo;, &ldquo;y&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo; commands use ARG8, ARGT and
</p>
<p>
ARGIO respectively, ta determine the memory address at which
</p>
<p>
the required user routine is to be Called. The &lsquo;u&rsquo; comand
provides an easy method of setting a value in ARGS, ARG? or
ARGIO.
</p>
<p>
The first argument determines for which comand the memory
address is being set- &ldquo;17 sets the menory addres for the &lsquo;&reg;&rdquo;
command (ARSE). 2&rsquo; sets the memory address for the &lsquo;y&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
comeand (ARG9). &lsquo;3&rsquo; sets the aeaory address for the *2&rsquo;
command (ARGIO). The second arguaent is the value to be
set up for the appropriate command.
</p>
<p>
A &ndash; 1, 20 3 only. Selects &ldquo;xy &lsquo;y&rdquo; or *2&rdquo;
BEBE &mdash;&rdquo; memory address at which the user routine will&rdquo; be
calles.
</p>
<p>
This 1a just an easy method of setting up the last three
NAS-SYS arguments independently and without having to alter or
enter the values for the earlier argueents. The values which
are set in the NAS-SYS arguments Gan be examined at any time
by use of the SYS-EX &ldquo;a&rdquo; command.

<p>
&mdash; required file name ---
</p>
<p>
Verity named file
</p>
<p>
This command is identicat to the SYS-EX &ldquo;r* command with
two exceptions. The first exception is that the prompt for
entry of the required file name is &ldquo;vName:&rdquo;. The second
exception is that when a match between the required file
fame and a file name read from cassette tape accurs, the
NAS-SYS Verify command is called. Therefore, the file is
not loaded&rsquo; into memory.
</p>
<p>
This command tg essential to check that a tile written by
the SYS-EX &ldquo;Ww&rdquo; command can be successfully read,
