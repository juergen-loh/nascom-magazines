2. Copy 48 characters from a specified memory address to the
top line of the screen. The command is entered with at least
one argument. The first argument entered is the memory
address from which 48 characters are copied to the top line
of the screen.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
AAAA &ndash; memory address from which 48 characters are copied.
</p>
<p>
Using the top line has always been a bit of a problem.
With the &lsquo;t&rdquo; command the top line can easily be used to hold
titles or any other text which is best not scrolled.

<p>
Sets up a specified value in one of the NAS-SYS arguments
ARG8, ARG9 or ARG10.
</p>
<p>
The SYS-EX &lsquo;x&rsquo;, &lsquo;y&rsquo; and &lsquo;z&rsquo; commands use ARG8, ARG9 and
ARG10 respectively, ta determine the memory address at which
the required user routine is to be called. The &lsquo;u&rsquo; command
provides an easy method of setting a value in ARG8, ARG9 or
ARG10.
</p>
<p>
The first argument determines for which command the memory
address is being set. &lsquo;1&rsquo; sets the memory address for the &lsquo;x&rdquo;
command (ARG8). &lsquo;2&rsquo; sets the memory address for the &lsquo;y&rsquo;
command (ARG9). &lsquo;3&rsquo; sets the memory address for the &lsquo;z&rsquo;
command (ARG10). The second argument is the value to be
set up for the appropriate command.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
A &ndash; 1, 2 3 only. Selects &lsquo;x&rsquo; &lsquo;y&rsquo; or &lsquo;z&rsquo;<br>
BBBB &ndash; memory address at which the user routine will be
called.
</p>
<p>
This is just an easy method of setting up the last three
NAS-SYS arguments independently and without having to alter or
enter the values for the earlier arguments. The values which
are set in the NAS-SYS arguments can be examined at any time
by use of the SYS-EX &lsquo;a&rsquo; command.

Verity named file

<p>
This command is identical to the SYS-EX &lsquo;r&rsquo; command with
two exceptions. The first exception is that the prompt for
entry of the required file name is &lsquo;vName:&rsquo;. The second
exception is that when a match between the required file
name and a file name read from cassette tape occurs, the
NAS-SYS Verify command is called. Therefore, the file is
not loaded into memory.
</p>
<p>
This command is essential to check that a file written by
the SYS-EX &lsquo;w&rsquo; command can be successfully read.
