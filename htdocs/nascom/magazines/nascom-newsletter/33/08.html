T have been using Mordease 2 for about two years. As a
teacher I find 1t invaluable for the preparation of workshests,
exam papers and the like. When I bought this program it was a
Simple choice between it and Naspen and although both had their
advantages and disadvantages I settled for the RAM based system
so that it could be sore easily updated. Nothing is perfect
however and there were several deficiencies that I have tried to
fake good over the tise I&rsquo;ve been using it. this article,
together with the assembler listing, describe these changes.
The main changes are as fol low:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Current position&rdquo; when processing.
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;conditional eject&rdquo; facility is useful but T found that
1 very often needed to know how many lines there were remzining
ona particular page so that I could decide whether to include
an extra paragraph or not. Lines 6&amp;0 &ndash; 1210 encode a routine
which outputs the current page being processed and how many
lines remain on that page. The right hand side of the top screen
line is used during the process phase. Simply put a &ldquo;halt&rdquo; at
the end of the text to find out how mich space is left.

Support for Epson MX 90 printer.

For quite some time I used an ancient Olivetti terminal
printer that did not respond ta &ldquo;escape&rdquo; sequences in the way
that more aodern printers do. When I started to use an Epson T
found several problems &ndash; I could switch underline on, but not
off again? The justification option in the processor was taking
note of the printer contral codes so that a line sith an
Underlined word would be justified to a right margin 6 coluans
The other problem arose when processing printer control codes on
the screen via Porti &ndash; the escape sequences tended to mess up
the screen display. Lines 1700 &ndash; 1930 trap all control-U codes
and increment a second line-length counter which is subsequently
Used for the justification process. There are several patches
which are needed to reinstate the correct value at the start of
each new line. Lines 5250-3420 and 1270 &ndash; 1370 trap the
output via Porti and Port? and modify being output. Output to
Portt (screen) has a table of control codes (&lt;20H) and any of
these have Bit 7 set so they are output as graphics characters.
In order to send Null codes (OOH) to the printer to turn off
certain features it is necessary to send 255 instead. The Port2
patch detects these codes and sends 00. The robles is the
Wordease uses 00h as the end of line marker in tts text buffer.
Both these Port patches also detect the &ldquo;pad&rdquo; character (see
below.
