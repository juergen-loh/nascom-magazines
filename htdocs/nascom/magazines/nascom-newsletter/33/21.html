Discs and Ports on a Nascom&nbsp;1

<p>
When installing the Nascom F.D.C. card or any assembly using
an off-board P.I.O. on a Nascom&nbsp;1, you will find that the
on-board P.I.O. will no longer function. This is because the
decoding for selecting ports 0 to 3 (keyboard and UART) from
ports 4 to 7 (P.I.O.) relied on the I/O select link being wired
to &lsquo;INT&rsquo; which is actually a2.
</p>
<p>
Once the I/O select is moved to &lsquo;EXT&rsquo;, which is actually
NasIO, the address line a2 is disconnected and the port decoding
is incomplete, causing any reference to ports 4 to 7 to be
directed to ports 0 to 3 respectively.
</p>
<p>
If the P.I.O. was in use prior to the addition of discs then
the only advice that Nascom can offer is that you buy a P.I.O.
board, not a very economic method of sorting out this simple
problem. There follows a method that will solve the port
decoding problem for approx. 20p plus labour.

Parts Required.
</h3>
<p class="indent2">
1 x 74LS02 Quad NOR Gate<br>
3 x lengths of wire 30cm long

<h3>
Method.
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Locate IC&nbsp;46 (74LS00)</li>
<li>Remove, bend out pin 2, replace.</li>
<li>Take 74LS02, bend sideways all pins except pins 1,7,14.</li>
<li>Solder 74LS02 on top of 74LS00 using pins 7 and 14.</li>
<li>Bend pin 1 of 74LS02 to join pin 2 of 74LS00.</li>
<li>Solder these two pins.</li>
<li>Remove link on I/O select completely.</li>
<li>Connections to 74LS02 are as follows:<br>
pin 10 to pin 11<br>
pin 3 to pin 4<br>
pin 2 to pin 8 to I/O select &lsquo;EXT&rsquo;<br>
pin 5 to pin 9 to I/O select &lsquo;INT&rsquo;<br>
pin 13 to I/O select &lsquo;COM&rsquo;<br>
Ground from pin 7 to pin 6 and pin 12
</li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">
Once the wiring changes have been made, all that needs to be
done is to reassemble and test.
</p>
<h3>
Testing.
</h3>
<p>
Using the NAS-SYS commands &lsquo;O&rsquo; and &lsquo;Q&rdquo;, type the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>O 6 0F &nbsp; Initialise port A as an output.</li>
<li>O 7 0F &nbsp; Initialise port B as an output.</li>
<li>O 4 55 &nbsp; Send 55H to port A.</li>
</ol>
