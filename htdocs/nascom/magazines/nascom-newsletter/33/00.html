Centipede &pound;6.95
</p>
<p>
A very good version of the popular arcade game. You have
control of a spray can of DDT and your task is to kill the bugs
before they kill you. The bugs range from centipedes to spiders,
all equally deadly. The game was written using a compiling BASIC
fo is effectively machine-code which leads te fast and smooth
movement. A good game for all the family.

<p>
Dart &pound;6.95
Another game from the author of our Invasion Earth. Written
using compiling BASIC, it is very fast and addictive. Based on
the arcade game &lsquo;The Qix&rsquo;, the object is to &lsquo;box&rsquo; in the Dart by
drawing round areas of the screen. In the first phase you only
have to avoid being hit by the Dart when you are in the process
of drawing a line but in the second phase onwards you must avoid
being trapped by the Fuse which burns along the lines. as. you
draw then. A different type of game to the Standard. &ldquo;Invaders&rdquo;
type but equally 1 not more addictive.
