<b>Centipede</b><span style="float: right">&pound;6.95</span>
</p>
<p>
A very good version of the popular arcade game. You have
control of a spray can of DDT and your task is to kill the bugs
before they kill you. The bugs range from centipedes to spiders,
all equally deadly. The game was written using a compiling BASIC
so is effectively machine-code which leads to fast and smooth
movement. A good game for all the family.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
<b>Dart</b><span style="float: right">&pound;6.95</span>
</p>
<p>
Another game from the author of our Invasion Earth. Written
using compiling BASIC, it is very fast and addictive. Based on
the arcade game &lsquo;The Qix&rsquo;, the object is to &lsquo;box&rsquo; in the Dart by
drawing round areas of the screen. In the first phase you only
have to avoid being hit by the Dart when you are in the process
of drawing 2 line but in the second phase onwards you must avoid
being trapped by the Fuse which burns along the lines as you
draw them. A different type of game to the standard &lsquo;Invaders&rsquo;
type but equally if not more addictive.

<p class="noindent">
<b>Naspic</b><span style="float: right">&pound;9.95</span>
</p>
<p>
A very useful tool for all BASIC programmers. Supplied
either in EPROM or on tape, this relocateable, 2K utility allows
you to add graphics and text displays to your BASIC programs
easily. Using the standard screen editing facilities of Nas-sys
simply design the screen display you want (graphics and/or text)
and then Naspic will convert it to a BASIC subroutine and add it
to the end of your program. It makes the designing and
programming of screen displays and layouts easy.
