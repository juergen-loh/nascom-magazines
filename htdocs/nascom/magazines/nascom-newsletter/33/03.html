File names are compared. A required name will match
with an identical name read from cassette tape. Also,
required name will match with a longer name read from cassette
tape, providing that all the characters match up to and
including the last character (i.e. last non-space) of the
required name. If a file name read from cassette tape
fails to match the required name, the search continues.
When a match is found, the NAS-SYS Read command is
called to read the file into memory.
</p>
<p>
The command is terminated after the conclusion of the
NAS-SYS Read following a successful file name match.
Between entry of the required file name and a successful
file name match, the command may be terminated by first
stopping the tape and then typing four ESC (SHIFT:ENTER)
characters. Four consecutive ESC characters read from the
cassette tape input will have the same effect.

AAAA &ndash; value to be added to the memory address read from
cassette tape. (NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 only)

<p>
This command, along with the &lsquo;w&rsquo; command, was one of the
earliest routines to be written. The rest of SYS-EX largely
grew from here. It is worth mentioning that any file which
can be read by the &lsquo;r&rsquo; command can also be read by the
standard NAS&nbsp;SYS &lsquo;R&rsquo; command. Due to the absence of a file
name, the reverse of course, is not true.

Search for a tape label
</p>
<p>
Read a cassette tape and search for a tape label as
written by the &ldquo;l&rdquo; command. Display the label on the top line
of the screen then terminate the command.
</p>
<p>
The tape drive LED is switched on between entry of the
command and command termination. If a tape label is not
found, the command may be terminated by first stopping the
cassette tape recorder and then typing four ESC (SHIFT:ENTER)
characters. Four consecutive ESC characters read from the
cassette tape input will have the same effect.
</p>
<p>
The command may be used for positioning a cassette tape
prior to writing a file.

Copies 48 characters to the top line (line 16) of the
screen. There are two alternate formats of the command as
follows:
</p>
<p class="noindent">
1. Copy a line of text from a screen line (1 to 15) to the
top line of the screen. The command is entered without any
arguments. (i.e. the 8 should be the only character on
the line.) The line which is entered following the command
line, is duplicated on the top line of the screen.
