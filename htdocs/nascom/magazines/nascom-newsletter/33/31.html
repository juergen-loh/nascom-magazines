<p>
jefore you can load or save data from within a program the nase
of the file used has to be identified to NAS-DOS.NAS-DOS
allows one file name ta be used for input and another for
Sutput. It does not allow multiple input or output files, so in
applications here Several input or output files are to be
handled the appropriate ones must be opened before access is
attempted. There are three forms of file opening command:
</p>
<p>
USR(11),FNS &ndash; opens a file for reading.
USR(12),FNS &ndash; opens an existing file for output.
USRU13),FNS &ndash; opens a new output file.
</p>
<p>
Note that in the case of a new output file the length of this
file, in sectors of 256 bytes, should have been set by a
POKES347,n instruction, where nis the number of sectors. If
there is&rsquo;insufficient space on the disc for this number of
sectors the masimum available space will be used.
</p>
<p>
FNS is the file name to be used, and must be a string variable
(not an array) of length 8 characters. If the name is less than
@ characters long you MUST include extra spaces in declaring the
name &ndash; &copy;9
</p>
<p>
FNS="MIKE *
</p>
<p>
NAS-DOS returns in the function an indication of whether the
file name specified existed &ndash; a non-zero result indicates that
the file name did not exist. Your program should check this
error condition and trap any error before any further file
access is attempted.
</p>
<p>
Note that NAS-DUS organises disc {11e so that all the contents
of a file must be contiguous &ndash; 1e the file is not divided and
Spread over the disc. Thus it is possible to delete a lot of
small. files spread around the disc and have an apparently large
amount of disc space available, but as this is not contiguous it
fay be impossible to create large disc file, even though its
Size is less than the total free disc space. The disc utilitiy
REORG could be used to copy and compress the free space,
although in practice this is an extremely rare problem. When
files are deleted in NAS-DOS the space occupied by the file
itself is freed for future use automatically, although the entry
in the directory 15 merely marked as a deleted file, rather than
being removed from the directory. Any deleted files in the
directroy are removed by the IC command of NAS-DOS. This
technique can be very useful in sometimes allowing apparently
deleted files to be found ane recovered relatively easily from
disc 1f a (user!) program goes berserk and overmrites the
directory.
