The least useful operation of the WAIT &ndash; GATE is with both
ROM and RAM of either &lt;&nbsp;275ns or &gt;&nbsp;525ns access time. The most
useful arrangement is with ROM of &lt;&nbsp;400ns and RAM of &lt;&nbsp;275ns.
To give results, for the test programs given in the manual,
over the full range of ROM and RAM set ups would take up a lot
of space and reading time. So I will give results for only one
arrangement, which I think is the most frequently used today.
ie. for 500ns (&lt;&nbsp;525ns) ROM &amp; EPROM and 250ns (&lt;&nbsp;275ns) RAM.

To summarise. I found the WAIT &ndash; GATE a very useful time
saving device. It had only one noticable side effect which was
increased programming speed (which can&rsquo;t be too bad!) Finally,
the most remarkable aspect for me, was the price Phildata are
asking for this piece of hardware, just &pound;&nbsp;7.95. all inclusive.
I should like to thank Mr. D. Johnson of Phildata for providing
the WAIT &ndash; GATE for review and assisting with my questions,
