second drawback would be in finding a particular entry &ndash; we
could either read each record in turn starting at the beginning
until we get to the right one, or more efficiently we could look
at the middle record of the file, determine if this is before or
after the required data item, and then look at the middle record
Of either the ton or bottom half of the records, etc. There are
time penalties in these approaches since disc access with floppy
discs is relatively slow, although the latter, binary seach,
method is quite efficient.

Next month we wilf discuss the alternative methods of
controlling access to random files.

7. AVG CONNECTION STANDARDS
</p>
<p>
We have now defined some standards for connection of colour
monitors to the AVC, and these ae used on those production
machines which have the AVC fitted as standard.
</p>
<p>
These connections can also be used for monochrome monitors,
although most users have preferred in the past to use the normal
BNC connector as the output from the AVC. The advantage of the
scheae described here is that the 49 x 16 display can be made
permanaently available while using the AVC output sor graphics.
This can be very convenient if you want to run twin screens &mdash;
one containing menus or other text. This technique is used 19
NAS-CAD. An alternative would of course be to use the TU output
for the 48 x 18 screen. Although Clarity of the picture is not
as good ona TV display. A 25 way D-type plug is used for the
calour monitor and 48 x 16 displays while the BNC connector
Carries the usual AVC card output (controlled by the MODE
command to give either graphics or 49x 16 display). Note that
a plug is used on the rear panel of the computer (preferably in
position CON 4) to reduce the danger of plugging a printer into
the AVC and causing damage.
</p>
<p>
The connections between the 25-may D-type plug and the 1e-way
Scotchflex connector on the AVC are as follows:
