<p>
This article describes the second half of the commands
available under SYS-EX, following on from the previous article.
</p>
<p>
a
Query tape contents
</p>
<p>
Read 2 cassette tape and display on the screen any tape
labels as written by the &ldquo;1&rdquo; command, and any file names as
written by the &lsquo;w&rsquo; command or by the 8K Basic.
</p>
<p>
Each file name read is displayed on the next available
screen line and, if necessary, the screen lines are scrolled
</p>
<p>
in the normal way. The command is terminated by first
stopping the cassette tape recorder and then typing four
ESC (SHIFT:ENTER) characters. Four consecutive ESC
characters read from the cassette tape input will have the
</p>
<p>
same effect.
</p>
<p>
This command is one of the four SYS-EX comands that
display tape labels (the others are &ldquo;re&rdquo;, "s&rdquo; and &lsquo;v"). Tape
labels are always displayed within the first. 42 character
positions of the top line (line 16). Labels that are shorter
than the 42 character maximum length are space filled up to
the aaximum length. Therefore, displayed tape labels
overwrite the whole of the top line with the exception of the
final six character positions, which are almays left
unaltered.
</p>
<p>
r pAAA
required file name &mdash;-
</p>
<p>
Read named file
</p>
<p>
Read a cassette tape and search for a file name which
matches with the required file name. When a match is found,
read the file into memory using the NAS-SYS Read command.
</p>
<p>
After entry of the &lsquo;r&rdquo; command, the prompt &lsquo;rName:&rsquo;
appears on the next screen line and the required file name is
entered on that line. Optionally, &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; characters
may be entered as part of the required file name. A
transparent character will match mith any character read into
that position. The transparent character i= ASCII 7FH
(CONTROL: SHIFT: /).
</p>
<p>
The tape drive LED is switched on and the cassette tape
is searched for tape and file labels. Any tape labels
detected are displayed on the top screen line without
interruption of the command. As each file label is
detected, the file name is displayed on the screen line
immediately below the required file mame. Any file name or
text which was previously displayed on that line is blanked
