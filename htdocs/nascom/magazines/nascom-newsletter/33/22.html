If a Graphics expansion board is fitted, care must be taken
to ensure that the added IC does not short on the underside of
the expansion board as it is mounted directly beneath.

The signal arriving from the F.D.C. card is a decode for
ports 0 through to F but as there is no decoding involving a3 it
means that there is only true decoding for ports 0 to 7.

Although not tested, it can be assumed that this
modification will also work when used with a P.I.O. board,
allowing the original P.I.O. to be used as well as the newly
added ones.

<p>
Should you for any reason no longer require this
modification, all that is needed is a new 74LS00 plugging in and
the I/O link replacing.
