of-record marker delimits data items it is not essential that
the records are of fixed length. Therefore it is impossible to
replace an item in the middle of a file directly &ndash; there is 10
certainty where the record concerned begins,or whether the
replacement will exactly fit in the space. Editing of these
files can therefore be laborious, as is access to any point in
the file. The method which mould need to be used to insert an
item would be to read each record fram an input file and copy it
to anew output file. When the point at which the new record is
to be inserted is reached the new record would be output, and
then the remainder of the file would be read and copied record
by record into the new file. The old file could then be deleted
and the new one re-named.

Sequential files are quite convenient when you wish to read all
the contents of a file into memory and carry out the
manipulation of the data in memory. When you have finished
Processing the data in memory the entire data can be witten to
@ Sequential file. Thus in handling data which can be loaded
into menory this is a convenient method to use, since operating
on the data in memory is inevitably quicker than any method
which requires repeated disc acceas to obtain individual data
ftems. &lsquo;Small data files and index files can conveniently be
treated in this way.

A random file can be cead/written directly at any point. In
NAS-DOS &lsquo;the positions in a file are measured in disc sectors (of
256 bytes) from the start of the file. In its simplest, and
most common form, each record will be up to 255 bytes long&rsquo; and
will occupy one sector. You can go to any sector directly by
Specifying its relative sector number in the file prior to the
read or weite operation. This is done by 2 DOKE to location
5365 of the relative sector number, starting at 0 for the first
sector, eq

Since you have direct access in this way to any point ina file
itis vory simple to amend a specific record simply by rewriting
the appropriate sector of data on disc. You can if necessary
arrange your own &lsquo;housekeeping&rsquo; routines to pack two sets of
data into a sector, or to use&nbsp;? sectors to store each set of
data. &lsquo;Far example in the latter case you would access the 107th
item of the data by starting to read at relative sector 18 of
the file (the first item 15 in sectors 0 and 1, the second in 2
and Sete).

The problem with a random (ile is knowing where to store a new
item of data, and mare importantly where to find a data item.
Host records stored an disc will have the most important item in
the record at the beginning. The individual items of data in a
record are usually known as fields, and the first of these, or
the one by which each&rdquo; record ts usually referenced (eg in
searchesS) 15 the key field. One method of inserting a new
record into a random file would be to store the records in
Siphabetical order by their key field. This has two major
Urawbacts &ndash; firstly to store an item we would have to move all
records up the file to create the space for the new entry. The
