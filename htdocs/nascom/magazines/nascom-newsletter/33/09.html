which will not be changed by the justification process. This is
especially useful when laying out tables. The &ldquo;linefeed&rdquo; key
will put a = on the screen but both of the output ports detect
this character and change it two a space character.

<h3>
Additional embedded formatting commands.
</h3>
<p>
Three additional formatting commands have been added to
provide centring of lines and automatic paragraph numbering.
Lines 1950&nbsp;&ndash; 3050 of the source listing code for these
additions.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
.M when used at the end of a line, in place of .N will cause
that line to be centred within the currently set margins. i.e.
it will assume that leading spaces, inserted by .T or .I
commands, are a part of the text to be included in the centring.
.M will be treated like .N by the Adjust command.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
.A will insert a right-justified, two-digit number. It will
automatically increment each time it is used. The value starts
from &ldquo;1&rdquo; and it can be reset at any time by using .A0.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
.B is similar to .A except that it inserts lower case letters
&ldquo;a&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;z&rdquo;. Again it will automatically increment and it can be
reset to &ldquo;a&rdquo; with .B0.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
The remainder of the source listing deals with the many patches
to the original program which are needed in order to implement
the changes. The easiest way in which to effect the changes will
be to use ROM ZEAP if you have it. Power up ZEAP with its
buffer located above 3000H and type in the object code. Load
your original Wordease 2 and assemble to memory.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Note that I have a modified NAS-SYS so that my parallel printer
output goes via XOUT and that 07H (ctrl-G) produces a &ldquo;beep&rdquo; so
you might need to alter these locations to NOP.
