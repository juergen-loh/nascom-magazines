Three additional formatting commands have been added to
provide centring of lines. and automatic paragraph numbering.
Lines 1950- 3050 of the source listing code for these
additions.

&lt;M when used at the end of a line, in place of .N will cause
that line to be centred within the currently set margins. i-e-it
will assume that leading spaces, inserted by .T or -T
commands, are a part of the text to be included in the centring.
CN&rsquo;will be treated like .N by the Adjust command.

The remainder of the source listing deals with the many patches

buffer located above 3000H and type in the object code. Load

your original Wordease 2 and assemble to memory.
Note that I have a modified NAS-SYS so that my parallel printer
eutput goes via XOUT and that 07H (ctri-G) produces a &ldquo;beep&rdquo; so
you might need to alter these locations to NOP.
