including the fle opening commands described above, require
additional variable names to specify the data (or filename) to
be saved &ldquo;or loaded. There are a number of significant
restrictions associated with these names in ROM BASIC. Again
you should realise that these are associated with the simple
BASIC Routine Handler incorporated within NAS-DOS for use with
the ROM BASIC. These restrictions are not inherent in NAS-DOS
itself, and the Extended BASIC, XBASIC, for example,
incorporates ore sophisticated transfer of data between files
and variables which are not subject to these restrictions. The
main restrictions are as follows:
</p>
<p>
1. Only simple character strings may be loaded or saved.
Numbers! mist be converted using the STRS and VAL functions
before/after disc access. The variable cannot be an. array
element. Thus if you have a 20 element numeric array AC) which
you wish to store on disc you would need to use lines of the
fora

<p>
100 FOR I=1 10 20
110 AS= STRSCACI))
120 ASUSR(32) , As
130 NEXT
</p>
<p>
to save the elements in character string form.
</p>
<p>
2. While more than one string can be loaded/saved in a single
USR( ) statement the strings are stored directly on disc with no
separator between them, although after each disc write statement
an&rsquo; end-of-record character (OD hex) is output to disc
Therefore in order to read back the data where more than one
item has been stored ina record the strings must be of known
fixed length otherwise the disc read statement will not be able
to determine where one string ends and the next begins. Where
the length of the string 18 variable you will need to fix the
length by padding it out to the requied length with additional
spaces. Note that this applies where more than one variable 18
read/weitten in a single USK call &ndash; if only one variable is
referenced each time NAS-DOS will use the end-of-record
separator which is put in the file after each disc write
Statement to determine where data which ix being read
terminates.
</p>
<p>
These limitations do not affect XBASIC, which allows almost any
type of variable to be read or written see the XBASIC. manual
for more detasis on this.
</p>
<p>
There are essentially tho different types of data file which can
be saved on disc &ndash; at least using NAS-DOS. These are knows as
Sequential files and randoa files. We will describe sequential
files here and introduce random files. next moath we will
describe random files in more detail.
</p>
<p>
Sequential files are very comparable with gata written onto
magnetic tape. Generally to get any item on the file. you. must
Start. from the beginning and read (or write) each item in turn
until you get to the required point. If you are writing the
file you &ldquo;must then wite any remaining data. Because the end=
