JOIN. This joins the current cursor position ta the LSP
(ast saved point) with a white &ldquo;line. By &ldquo;line&rdquo; I mean
the shortest distance between the two points using the
block pixel graphics. This usually resembles a
&ldquo;staircase: The LSP is reset to the current. cursor
position. &lsquo;Line&rsquo; drawing becomes quich and easy!
</p>
<p>
MOVE. The cursor may be positioned anywhere on the NASPIC
page by use of the normal cursor control keys. The cursor
1S blinting and non-destructive. There 18 no wrap around.
The NASPIC page is from line 1 to line 14 inclusive:
</p>
<p>
CETIONS. This command sets the rates for cursor speed
and repeat. The cursor speed may be from &lt;1&gt; (fast) Cand
itis), ta &lsquo;9&gt; (slow. The repeat is enabled by &lt;Y) or
gisabled by &ldquo;N. For the repeat mith NAS&nbsp;SYS&nbsp;I you need
che Bits and FCs Toolkit.
</p>
<p>
PROGRAM. This compiles the current NASPIC page to a BASIC
program and sppends it to the end of any existing BASIC
Program (it doesn&rsquo;t matter if there len&rsquo;t one). As in
C5: there is a Y/N. prompt before the procedure is
carried out. When &lsquo;compifation&rsquo; 15 completed the user is
returned to BASIC. NB. BASIC must have been cold started
before NASPIC can used to produce the final product.
</p>
<p>
UIT. This clears the screen and returns the user to
has Sys. It&rsquo;s a bit of pity you don&rsquo;t have the option
to chose between NAS&nbsp;SYS and BAST
</p>
<p>
RUBOUT. This is the opposite of draw 1.0. it leaves =
</p>
<p>
black &lsquo;Iine&rsquo; behind 1t. However, any Character cell not
containing pixel characters is Dlanted out. This means
you can&rsquo;t draw black (and for that matter white &lsquo;lines&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
through your graphics and text characters.
</p>
<p>
SAVE POINT. The current cursor position is set as the
ISP and is of course for use with the JOIN and UNJOIN
commands.
</p>
<p>
TEXT MODE. The keyboard 16 now enabled and text can be
entered on the screen. The repeat Key 15 disabled to
prevent Keyboard &ldquo;bounce&rdquo;. The left and right. cursors
provide wraparound on the same line. The entire
graphics set is again available to the user but of course
to enter a graphics character you need to know the right
combinations of keys to get them. Hence the the rather
clever idea of the CHARACTER mode.
</p>
<p>
UNJOIN, This 18 the opposite of join 1-8. at draws a
black &ldquo;line&rdquo; from the current cursor position to the
usr.
