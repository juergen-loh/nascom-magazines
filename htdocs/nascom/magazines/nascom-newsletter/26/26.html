<dt>
J &ndash;</dt><dd>JOIN. This joins the current cursor position to the LSP
last saved point) with a white &lsquo;line&rsquo;. By &lsquo;line&rsquo; I mean
the shortest distance between the two points using the
block pixel graphics. This usually resembles a
&lsquo;staircase&rsquo;&nbsp;! The LSP is reset to the current cursor
position. &lsquo;Line&rsquo; drawing becomes quick and easy!
</dd>
<dt>
M &ndash;</dt><dd>MOVE. The cursor may be positioned anywhere on the NASPIC
page by use of the normal cursor control keys. The cursor
is blinking and non-destructive. There is no wrap around.
The NASPIC page is from line 1 to line 14 inclusive.
</dd>
<dt>
O &ndash;</dt><dd>OPTIONS. This command sets the rates for cursor speed
and repeat. The cursor speed may be from &lt;1&gt; (fast) (and
it is), to &lt;9&gt; (slow). The repeat is enabled by &lt;Y;gt> or
disabled by &lt;N;gt;. For the repeat with NAS&nbsp;SYS&nbsp;1 you need
the Bits and PCs Toolkit.
</dd>
<dt>
P &ndash;</dt><dd>PROGRAM. This compiles the current NASPIC page to a BASIC
program and appends it to the end of any existing BASIC
program (it doesn&rsquo;t matter if there lsn&rsquo;t one). As in
&lt;CS&gt; there is a &lt;Y/N&gt; prompt before the procedure is
carried out. When &lsquo;compilation&rsquo; is completed the user is
returned to BASIC. N.B. BASIC must have been cold started
before NASPIC can used to produce the final product.
</dd>
<dt>
Q &ndash;</dt><dd>QUIT. This clears the screen and returns the user to
NAS-SYS. It&rsquo;s a bit of pity you don&rsquo;t have the option
to chose between NAS&nbsp;SYS and BASIC.
</dd>
<dt>
R &ndash;</dt><dd>RUBOUT. This is the opposite of draw i.e. it leaves a
black &lsquo;line&rsquo; behind it. However, any character cell not
containing pixel characters is blanked out. This means
you can&rsquo;t draw black (and for that matter white) &lsquo;lines&rdquo;
through your graphics and text characters.
</dd>
<dt>
S &ndash;</dt><dd>SAVE POINT. The current cursor position is set as the
ISP and is of course for use with the JOIN and UNJOIN
commands.
</dd>
<dt>
T &ndash;</dt><dd>TEXT MODE. The keyboard is now enabled and text can be
entered on the screen. The repeat key is disabled to
prevent keyboard &lsquo;bounce&rsquo;. The left and right cursors
provide wraparound on the same line. The entire
graphics set is again available to the user but of course
to enter a graphics character you need to know the right
combinations of keys to get them. Hence the the rather
clever idea of the CHARACTER mode.
</dd>
<dt>
U &ndash;</dt><dd>UNJOIN. This is the opposite of join i.e. it draws a
black &lsquo;line&rsquo; from the current cursor position to the
LSP.
