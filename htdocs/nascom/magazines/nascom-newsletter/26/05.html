<h3>
Assembler.
</h3>
<p class="indent">
Symbol tables can be created, sorted alphabetically, saved
and, more importantly, invoked from a pseudo op as an external
set of labels on disc in which case there is no check for
re-definition and that I do lament.
</p>
<p class="indent">
LIST &ndash; has many forms (source listing is done from the Editor
by CTRL X).
</p>
<p class="indent">
LINES &amp; MARGIN &ndash; control the listing position and length on
paper (and in fact).
</p>
<p class="indent">
DIR &ndash; directories of your disc can be seen easily but only on
one disc.
</p>
<p class="indent">
DISC &ndash; allows you to designate a working disc if you want a
different one so you don&rsquo;t have to specify which disc all the
time. This is more useful than a limitations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
There are two modes of assembly, one (1) for single origin
and, my preference, mode 0 for multi-origin assemblies. The
latter creates file which can dump the code in many absolute
locations when called via the assembler.
</p>
<p class="indent">
One more lament &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t been able to execute files like
DEBUG direct from assembler. Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t try but I
would like to have succeeded.
</p>
<h3>
Pseudo Ops.
</h3>
<p class="indent">
PUSH&rsquo;S or POP&rsquo;s &ndash; can be strung on one line &ndash; neat.
</p>
<p class="indent">
NOP 4 &ndash; some mnemonics can be repeated by following them with
a number. Very mice.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Binary, hex, decimal plus any radix up to 16 can be handled
using Q. Octal freaks will like this if there are still any
around.
</p>
<p class="indent">
ENDP &ndash; listings can be thrown to a new page at will.
</p>
<p class="indent">
PAUSE &ndash; nice op to stop assembly. Gives you time to think
before ploughing on.
</p>
<p class="indent">
COND/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>ENDC &ndash; gives conditional assembly.
</p>
<p class="indent">
QUERY &ndash; requests a value during assembly. Can be used with
above to form fancy conditional assemblies.
</p>
<p class="indent">
PRINT &ndash; displays during assembly &ndash; useful.
</p>
<p class="indent">
FOR/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>NEXT &ndash; creates repetative code with few labels in each
iteration.
</p>
<p class="indent">
MACR/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>RPT &ndash; repeats code n+i times &ndash; not as useful as above
</p>
<p class="indent">
INSERT &ndash; allows a side file to be inserted from disc during
assembly. A good working assembly could be accessed with this.
</p>
<p class="indent">
DEFL &ndash; all the old faithfulls are there plus this one which
allows a label to be redefined.
</p>
<p class="indent">
ADDR &ndash; reverses the byte order in a word as per 6800. Cross
assembly is possible by getting other versions of this
assembler.
</p>
<p class="indent">
EXEC &ndash; allows a machine code routine to be executed. Strange
one this but I could make good use of it given time.
</p>
<p class="indent">
LRRC, etc &ndash; logical shifts and inverts can be performed on
labels &ndash; has possibilities.
</p>
<p class="indent">
NAME &ndash; puts the name on every page &ndash; date and time if you need
and I do minutes as well!
</p>
<p class="indent">
OPCD &ndash; this in a macro but you define the code in hex. The
