Symbol tables can be created, sorted alphabetically, saved
and, more importantly, invoked from a pseudo op as an&rsquo;external
Set of labels on drat in which cawe there is na check for
re-definition and that 1 do lament

<p>
Uist &ndash; has many forms (source listing is done fram the Editor
by CTRL).
</p>
<p>
LINES &amp; MARGIN &ndash; control the listing position and length on
DIR &ndash; directories of your disc can be seen easily but only on
one disc.
</p>
<p>
DISC &ndash; allows you to designate a working disc 1f you want a
different one wo you don&rsquo;t have ta specify which dise all&rdquo; the
time. This is more useful than a limitations

There are twa mades of assembly, one (1) for single origin
and, my preference, made 0 for milti-origin, assemblies. The
Tatter creates (116 which can dump the code in many absolute
Locations when called via the assembler
</p>
<p>
Gne more lament &ndash; I haven"t been able to execute files like
DEBUG direct from assembler. Perhaps 1 shouldn&rsquo;&reg; try but T
would like to have succeeded.

Fseudo Ops.
PUSH&rsquo;S oF FOP&rsquo;s &ndash; can be strung on one line &ndash; neat.
NOP 4 &ndash; some mnemonics can be repeated by following them with
a number. Very mice.
Binary, hex, decimal plus any radix up to 16 can be handled
using 0. Octal freaks will like this 1 there are still. any
around.
ENDP listings can be thronn to anew page at will.
PAUSE &ndash; nice op to stop assembly. Gives you time to think
before ploughing on.
COND/ENDE &ndash; gives conditional assembly.
QUERY &ndash; requests a value during assembly. Can be used with
above to form fancy conditional assemblies.
PRINT &ndash; dieplays during assembly &ndash; useful.
FOR/NEXT &ndash; creates repetative code with few labels in each
iteration.
MACR/RPT &ndash; repeats code n+i times &ndash; not as useful as above
INSERT &ndash; allows a side file to be inserted from disc during
assembly. A good working assembly could be accessed with this.
DEFL &ndash; all the old farthfulls are there plus this one which
allows a label to be redefined:
ADDR &ndash; reverses the byte order in a word as per 6800. Cross
assembly 15 possible by getting other versions of this
Sssembler.
EXEC &ndash; allows a machine code routine to be executed. Strange
one this but I could make good use of it given time.
</p>
<p>
TRRC, etc logieal shifts and inverts can be performed on
labels &ndash; has possibilities.
NAME&rdquo; puts the name on every page &ndash; date and time 44 you need
</p>
<p>
and Ido minutes as well!
OPED &ndash; this in a macro but you define the code in hex. The
