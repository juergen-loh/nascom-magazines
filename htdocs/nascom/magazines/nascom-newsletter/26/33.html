<p class="continued">
the whole of a disc (76 tracks of 16 sectors each) it is
possible to specify the data file to be on a disc drive other
than 0, so that this disc can be dedicated to the data. However,
the index file for any application must ALWAYS be mounted in
disc drive 0. In a similar vein I have seen some users loading
MANOR and UTS from their original master disc and then changing
the disc in drive 0 for their own data (and index) disc. It
really makes it much easier to use the system if you copy at
least MANOR and UTS (or even all the files) from your original
master disc onto any disc you intend to use for MANOR. In this
way the disc becomes self contained, and you don&rsquo;t need to keep
swapping discs. It is only if you want to create really big data
files that you need to remove the programs from the disc in
drive 0, and even that requirement is largely eliminated if you
use a separate data disc and only keep the index(es) on the disc
in drive 0.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally if you intend inexperienced users to use MANOR
(or indeed any application program) you can make life easier for
them by using the NAS-DOS &lsquo;User boot&rsquo; facility. This allows a
specified program to be initiated simply by typing. ]U and
pressing the ENTER key. Refer to your NAS-DOS manual for more
details of this very useful, but underutilised, feature. The one
point you should remember with the user boot is that it is NOT
copied from disc to disc when the COPYDD utility is used&nbsp;&ndash; you
will need to use separate ]R and ]W commands to copy the user
boot sector (track 0, sector 1).
</p>
<p>
One further hint if you manage to delete your index file
(the one suffixed I rather than D), which would normally prevent
you doing a <span class="uppercase">Reruild</span>. ALl you need in the index file to permit
rebuilding is the file format information. Therefore you could
insert a new disc (DON&rsquo;T use the old one) and use HINTON to
specify the number of records, fields, field names and widths in
the usual way. Then use FILCPY to copy the index file (NOT the
data file) which is created onto the old disc. You will then be
able to use <span class="uppercase">Rebuild</span> to recreate the remainder of the index data
from the data file. This will only work if you specify the same
number of fields and the correct field widths as in the original
file. If you are really desperate and don&rsquo;t have a note of this
information you could resort to the NAS-DOS R command tO read
is the start of the data file and examine the data in memory to
see what format you originally used. The normal disc directory
shows you where the data file starts. There is of course no
reason in normal operation why any of these steps should be
necessary&nbsp;&ndash; but if you inadvertently delete the wrong file and
have no back-up (VERY naughty) it is reassuring to know what
solutions (apart from suicide) are available.

<u>4. Nascom extended BASIC</u>
</h3>
<p>
The tape version of the extended BASIC has been available
for a few months now, and seems to have been well accepted. We
now have an identical CP/M version available. The NAS-DOS
version has been rather delayed, but is now confidently(?!)
expected in January.
