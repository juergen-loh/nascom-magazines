the whole of 3 dise (76 tracks of 16 sectors each) it 16
possible to sperify the data file to be on a disc drive other
than 0, so that this dise can be dedicated to the data, However,
the index file for any application must ALWAYS be mounted 10
disc drive 0. Ina similar vero I have seen some users loading
MANOR and UTS fram their origifal master dise and then changing
the dine in drive 0 for their own data (and index) die. Tt
really makes it much easter to use the system if you copy at
least maNOR and UTS (or even all the files) from your original
master disc onto any disc you intend to use for MANOR. In this
Gay the disc becomes self contained, and you don&rsquo;t need to keep
Swapping disce. It is only if you want to create really big data
(ileu that you need to remove the programs from the disc in
Urive 0, and evan that reqirement is largely eliminated if you
(se a separate data disc and only keep the index (es) on the dise
in derve 0.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally if you intend inexperienced users to use MANOR
(or indeed any application program) you can make life easier for
thea by using the N@5-D0S &lsquo;User boot&rsquo; facility. fis allows a
specified program to be initiated simply by typrng. JU&rdquo; and
pressing the ENTER key. Refer ta your NAS-DOS manual for more
Getails of this very useful, Dut Underuti lised. feature. The one
point you should remeaber with the user boot is that it 1 NOT
Copied from disc to ise when the COPYOD utility is used &ndash; you
mall need to use separate JR and JW commands to copy the user
haat sector (tract 0, sector I).

<p>
One further hint if you manage to delete your index file
(the one suffixed I rather than 0), which would normally prevent
you doing 4 RERUILD. AL] you need in the index file to perme
Febuilding is the file format information Therefore you could
insert a few dise (DON&rsquo;T use the old&rdquo; one) and. use HINTON. to
specify the number of records, fields, field names and widths in
the usual way. Then use FILCPY to copy the index file (NOT the
data file) which 12 created onto the old disc. You will then be
able to use REBUILD to recreate the remainder of the index data
from the data file. This mill only wort if you specify the same
number of fields and the correct field widths as in the original
file. If you are really desperate and dan&rsquo;t have a note of this
information you could resort to the NAS-DOS R command tO read
10 the start of the data file. and examine the data in memory to
See what format you originally used. The normal die. directory
Shows you where the data file starts. There is af course no
Feason in normal operation why any af these steps should be
necessary &ndash; but if you inadvertently delete the wrong file and
have na back-up (VERY naughty) :t ig reassuring to&rdquo; know what
sGlutions (apart from suicide) are available:

Nascom extended BASIC

<p>
The tape version of the extended BASIC has been available
for a few months now, and seems to have been well accepted. We
now have an. identical CP/M&rdquo; version. available. The NAS-DOS
Version has been rather delayed, but is now confidently (?!)
expected in January.
