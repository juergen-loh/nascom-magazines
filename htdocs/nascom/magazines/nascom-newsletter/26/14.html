Easy 4000 Baus on a Nascom&nbsp;2
</h1>

This article describes 2 very simple method of producing a
high speed interface for the Nascom&nbsp;2 enabling a whole 64k of
memory to be dumped or recovered from tape in about 2 and a half
</p>
<p>
minutes with the moimum of fuss.
</p>
<p>
The modification includes the commonly carried out 2400 baud
conversion which, Briefly, involves connecting:
TP2t ta TPS
and 1P20 to Tra
on the main board and then setting LSW? switches 1 &amp; 6 in the UP
</p>
<p>
A glance at sheet 2 of the Nascom&nbsp;2 circunt diagram will
show that IC22 generates a signal of 36.4&nbsp;KHz to control data
transter and receive rates, thus is the limting factor in the
above 2400 baud modification At ICSI pin Il there 15a signal
Gf 62.5 KH: and by simply connecting a wire between ICSI pin&rdquo; Il
and TP20 we have effectively removed this constraint and the
Chevette &ldquo;receive, and transmit. rates are nearly doubled.
Wartote, quite rightly, tell me that pin 1 of 1022&rdquo; should be
</p>
<p>
disconnected from it&rsquo;s&rdquo; socket&rdquo; to, avold probleas mith beat
frequencies but I have not done this because of the bother of a
Second suitch and have had absolutely mo i1l-etfects.&gt;

14 the Link between ICSI pin 11 and TP20 has a switch (NSt)
then the following cassette speeds are available:&ndash;

1 have found that on my system using a very cheap Japanese
cassette recorder and good quality ordinary bias audio tapes,
can achieve very nearly 100% reliability in tape data transfer
at any speed and get those lengthy programs in and. aut of my
machine both rapidly and with the minimum of bother and fuss.
