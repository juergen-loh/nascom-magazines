Easy 4000&nbsp;Baud on a Nascom&nbsp;2
</h1>

<p>
This article describes a very simple method of producing a
high speed interface for the Nascom&nbsp;2 enabling a whole 64K of
memory to be dumped or recovered from tape in about 2 and a half
minutes with the minimum of fuss.
</p>
<p>
The modification includes the commonly carried out 2400&nbsp;baud
conversion which, briefly, involves connecting:
</p>
<table class="indent2">
<tr><td></td><td>TP21 to TP5</td></tr>
<tr><td>and</td><td>TP20 to TP4</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="continued">
on the main board and then setting LSW2 switches 1 &amp; 6 in the UP
position.
</p>
<p>
A glance at sheet 2 of the Nascom&nbsp;2 circuit diagram will
show that IC22 generates a signal of 38.4&nbsp;KHz to control data
transfer and receive rates, thus is the limiting factor in the
above 2400&nbsp;baud modification. At IC51 pin 11 there is a signal
of 62.5&nbsp;KHz and by simply connecting a wire between IC51 pin 11
and TP20 we have effectively removed this constraint and the
cassette receive and transmit rates are nearly doubled.
(Purists, quite rightly, tell me that pin 1 of IC22 should be
disconnected from it&rsquo;s socket to avoid problems with beat
frequencies but I have not done this because of the bother of a
second switch and have had absolutely no ill-effects.)

If the Link between IC51 pin 11 and TP20 has a switch (NS1)
then the following cassette speeds are available:&ndash;

<table class="indent2" style="width: 50%">
<tr><td>Baud Rate</td><td>NS1</td><td colspan=6 style="text-align: center">LSW2</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>300</td><td>OFF</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>300</td><td>ON</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr>
<tr><td>1200</td><td>OFF</td><td>U</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>U</td><td>D</td><td>D</td></tr>

<tr><td>2400</td><td>OFF</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td></tr>
<tr><td>4000</td><td>ON</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td><td>U</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan=6 style="text-align: center">(D = down, U = up)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
I have found that on my system using a very cheap Japanese
cassette recorder and good quality ordinary bias audio tapes,
can achieve very nearly 100% reliability in tape data transfer
at any speed and get those lengthy programs in and out of my
machine both rapidly and with the minimum of bother and fuss.
