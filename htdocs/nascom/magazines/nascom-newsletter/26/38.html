Hardware cornection standards
</p>
<p>
For the information of those of you not using Nascom S&rsquo;s we:
enclose details of the external connector wiring arrangements
miieh we use on the standard Nascom 5. In fact. we had adopted
these wiring conventions before Nasco Sas introduced. If you
use these conventions 1t will simplify moving geriphrals between
different Nascoms if you Should ever need to do this.
</p>
<p>
The standards are described in Application Notes AN-0003 to
AN-0005, Which are reproduced below. Next time we will be
Printing AN-OO0S, which deals specifically with the&rdquo; connection
Of printers.

Nascom&nbsp;2 and 3 cassette interface connections
</p>
<p>
The recommended connection used between the Nascom&nbsp;2 and
cassette recorder is via a 6-pin DIN connector. This allows use
of either the high or low output to. the recorder, and a
connection for switching the recorder on and aff by means of
&ldquo;Castle&rdquo;, or other, interface. The connections should be made as
follows:
