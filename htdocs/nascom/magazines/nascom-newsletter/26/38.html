In Chapter 4 the fourth example under FMT should show the
result of PRINT 7895 as 7.89500E+03, and not as 7.895000E+03.
</li>
<li>
In Chapter 4 the parameters for the ZONE command are given
in the wrong order. Zone can also be used as a function. The
correct description is as follows:<br>
ZONE &lt;J1&gt;,&lt;J2&gt; Sets the print zone (tab) width (&lt;a2&gt;), and the
largest column for which printing to the next zone will stay
on the same line (&lt;J1&gt;), known as the ZONE LIMIT. The default
settings for these will vary according<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>to the implementation,
and are specified in the scratch-pad list in appendix B, as
WIDTHT (zone limit) and ZWIDTH (zone width). The current
values for these may be obtained at any time by using the ZONE
as a function, ie PRINT ZONE(0) displays the zone limit, and
PRINT ZONE(1) displays the width.
</li>
<li>
In appendix C, in the description of the routine LEN1,
location TYPE should read NTYPE.
</li>
<li>
In appendix D the Listing of the HOME command, the Location
marked 4263 should read 4262.
</li>
<li>
In appendix D the default pointers for the auxiliary
tables are incorrect. They should read as follows:
<br>
<p class="indent">
3A80: 00 42 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start of auxiliary reserved word table<br>
3ABA: 40 42 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start of auxiliary address table<br><br>
</p>
If extra words are to be entered as temporary additions you
should use the normal scratch pad locations as in appendix B.
They will then be removed when you perform a cold start of the
BASIC. If, however, the additions are to be permanent you
should use the default locations given above. A cold start
will then still allow you to use the tables.

<u>5. Hardware connection standards</u>
</h3>
<p>
For the information of those of you not using Nascom&nbsp;3&rsquo;s we
enclose details of the external connector wiring arrangements
which we use on the standard Nascom&nbsp;3. In fact we had adopted
these wiring conventions before Nascom&nbsp;3 was introduced. If you
use these conventions it will simplify moving periphrals between
different Nascoms if you should ever need to do this.
</p>
<p>
The standards are described in Application Notes AN-0003 to
AN-0005, which are reproduced below. Next time we will be
printing AN-0006, which deals specifically with the connection
of printers.

<h4>
Nascom&nbsp;2 and 3 cassette interface connections
</h4>
<p>
The recommended connection used between the Nascom&nbsp;2 and
cassette recorder is via a 6-pin DIN connector. This allows use
of either the high or low output to the recorder, and a
connection for switching the recorder on and off by means of
&lsquo;Castle&rsquo;, or other, interface. The connections should be made as
follows:
