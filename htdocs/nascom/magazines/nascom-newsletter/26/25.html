<p>
What ts NASPIC 7 &ndash; It ts 2 2k machine code utility program
for the production of &lsquo;pages&rsquo; of graplics for BASIC. The pages
are produced with the help of NASPIC and then appended to the
end of a current BASIC program. RUNNing the program results in
the &ldquo;page&rdquo; being PRINTed.

<p>
What do you get 7 &ndash; NASPIC on tape restding at 1000hex to
1g00he: Git is fully relocatable so it&rsquo;s EPROMable&rsquo;) or 2k of
EPROM (again which may be plugged in anywhere) and a four page

</p>
<p>
What are the commands&nbsp;?- There are fourteen commands in
all. Taking them in alphabetical order&nbsp;:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
C &ndash; CHARACTER mode. The entire character set is displayed
fon line siiteen with a flashing non-destructive graphics
cursor. This cursor may be used to scan along the 256
graphics characters by use of the keys &lt;t&gt; and &lt;I&gt; for
left and right respectively. By using the normal cursor
contral keys the &lsquo;draming&rsquo; cursor may be positioned on
the screen at the desired point and. pressing the space
bar will result in the chosen graphics character being
Printed there. By repeating this procedure it is possible
to quickly ouile up a pretty picture of your own design.
To return te normal mode i.e MOVE, press &lt;ENTER&gt;.
</p>
<p>
CS &ndash; CLEAR SCREEN The screen may be cleared by &lt;SHIFT/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>BACK-SPACE&gt;.
To prevent acerdential erasure of the screen a
Y/N&gt; prompt request occurs. If &lt;Y&gt; then after the screen
ts cleared the cursor returns to HOME and MOVE mode is
</p>
<p>
entered.
D = DRAW mode. The flashing non-destructive &lsquo;drawing&rsquo; cursor
can be moved about the screen by using the normal cursor
control beys. It will leave a wmite &ldquo;line&rdquo; behind it. The
</p>
<p>
resolution is 94 x 42, There is ne wrap around over the
edge of the screen.
</p>
<p>
E- EDIT mode. The start address of a previously &lsquo;compiled&rsquo;
NASPIC page in the BASIC program im requested which is
then transfered to the screen for editing. If there is
</p>
<p>
no page or it is of incorrect format the transfer still
pecurs but with spectular and. fortunately non-fatal
</p>
<p>
results. The cursor ts sent to HOME and&rdquo; MOVE mode
HOME. This moves the cursor to its Nome position i.e.
</p>
<p>
bottom left hand corner of the screen. It also causes the
program to enter MOVE mode and resets the LSP (ast saved
