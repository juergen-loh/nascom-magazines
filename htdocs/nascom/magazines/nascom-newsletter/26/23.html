Here 1t would have been nice to be able ta paint to any
error on the screen before the printer started. printing.
Unfortunately, this was not possible and the best solution. 1
Could arrive at wae. having detected the error during printing,
Stop printing, print the Naspen line number where the error
breurred alang with an error code and then return control back
to Naspen.
</p>
<p>
By this tine, all of the allocated space nad been used and
considerable effort was put inte reducing the code required to
perform the various functions, not wishing to remove any options
or abbreviate the option menus. This entailed optimizing any
code that was duplicated and/or adjusting routines so this could
be achieved. along with the removal of any redundant&rdquo; code.
</p>
<p>
Finally, some nine months Later, 1t all slipped neatly inte a 2k
EFRON along mith the tmevitable bug or two which were later
Sorted cut, with more code compression required. The ZEAP source
</p>
<p>
code ultimately stretched to Zit.
</p>
<p>
There allowed several weels of ducumentation writing. The
only difficulty here was getting all the informatian onto paper
in Such a may that other people could read and. understand. vt.
However, by the time it was completed, it had. grown too. large
for a normal magazine article as I had tatended, sa, T submitted
it to Mrcre Power for evaluation, after which you can guese the
rest. So, a small word of advice to any would be programmers. If
vou think you have a good idea, get down and do something. about
it. Tt may not develope into anything, but you can mot tell
wales you try.

<p>
Finally, 2 brief description of what Nasprint-@0 can do. It
ts a 2h, EPROM-baved program which 1: normally located at. B000H
and witch will operate at 2 or 4 MHz with either Nas-sys I or 3.
</p>
<p>
Tt allows paginated or continous output from DEBUG, NAS-DIS,
NASPEN, ZEAP and Nas-sys. With Naspen, however, up to nine
different control codes may be embedded in the text to control
the output format or the printer directly, during printing. Page
lengths may be defined up to 255 lines with an optional title
heading the page, and page number, at the foot of the page, from
&copy; ta 999 beginning anywhere within that range. Both the title
and page number may be placed in any positson at the head and
foot of the page respectively with the aption of auto title
centring if required. Page format changes, outside Naspen
operation, are achieved by editing a default table before
</p>
<p>
returning ta the main program. All values used 1n the table are
in decsmal and default to standard fanfold paper (9.5" x 11").
Output to the printer is via the Nascom P10&rdquo; and 9o additional
</p>
<p>
interface 1!
</p>
<p>
Although throughout this article 1 have specifically
referred to the Epson printer, other parallel printers may. be
used. Should your printer not&rdquo; be compatible with Nasprint-80
your own output routine can be incorporated and substituted by
giving 1ts address as a second argument at 1mitialisation.
