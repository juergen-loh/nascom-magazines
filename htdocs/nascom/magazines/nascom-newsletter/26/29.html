Many thanks and I hope that this will be of use for people
converting projects from Nascom&nbsp;1 to 2 and vice-versa.

Mr. Edgar of Renfrewshire has written to me asking for for
help in interfacing an IBM Selectric Golfball printer to a Nascom&nbsp;2
and also on where to get more information on the ACCULAB
interface unit. If anyone can help on these I would be happy to
publish it.

<p>
If anyone out there has a Pluto system and wants to get in
touch with any other Pluto users, if you write to me I will pass
the names onto a lonely Pluto user who wishes to meet others.
