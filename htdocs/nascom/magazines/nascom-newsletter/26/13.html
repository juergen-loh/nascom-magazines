In his excellent article on labels for Xtal BASIC in Vol. 2,
No. 4, Stephen Hope calls for reports on bugs in Xtal. I wasn&rsquo;t
geing&rsquo;to respond because I have had such fun and practical use
from it inthe last Sand a half years that it seems like
treachery to slight it. The program is excellent and 1t was two
years before I uncovered a single bug. What prompts this letter
ts the TWO MINUTES 1t took to find. a bug in the prestigious
M-BASIC. Discussions at my local club suggest that there are
Plently more&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
So, having made it clear that I think that Xtal 48 ina
clase of its own, here is my solitary bug:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
In expotential, the interpreter accepts an expression like
49.6787600.5. (0 instead oF 0)
and returns a value of 1 Ge. the figure to the power zero)
</p>
<p>
Just for the record, the &ldquo;2 minute bug&rdquo; in M-BASICS, try
thst
</p>
<p>
10 DEFBL A,B,C
</p>
<p>
20 Clava
</p>
<p>
30 PRINT &copy;
As expected, C prints out as 1.3 recurring to 15 places. Now,try
replacing line 10 with &ldquo;DEFINT A,B: DEFBL &ldquo;and see what
happens &ndash; the last eight places are rubbish&rsquo; This begs the
question, why do people want double precision? To do @aths of
course. What functions does one use i mathe? Why the numeric
</p>
<p>
ones of course. (Yee, Itke log, sin, ete). And what is only
available in single precision in M-BASIC? Yes, you&rsquo;ve
Quessed!&rsquo;&rsquo;! Incredibre but true, the internal functions are only
</p>
<p>
Single precision &ndash; a PET is as good at maths as that.

Wordease Mods.
Now for something more constructive. Here are the addresses
to change to get Wordease working under CP/M on a Nascom with
tts screen mapped to F800!
12EB/EE/Fa
1501/07 /58/58/63/99/00
</p>
<p>
1474/06
1954 /5A/SD/65/68/85/93/98/AZ/05
1656/66/6F/97
</p>

1708/07 /22/17/21/30/C8

1B40/4E/51/59/68
1C30/3D/SB/61/64/6C/7F /85/88/90/04/26/C8
1053.
</p>
<p>
And of course change 1010 to 7D +F you have made a Nas&nbsp;sys&nbsp;3
version of MONITOR.COM (what better&rdquo; name for this than
NAS.CON7). With these mods. one can read in old tapes and print
them, or Save them to disk using the NAS.CON routines. 1 am
working ana full CP/M version, perhaps next Xmas...
