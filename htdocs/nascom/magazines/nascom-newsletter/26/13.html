BASIC Bugs and Wordease Mods. for CP/M

In his excellent article on labels for Xtal BASIC in Vol. 2,
No. 4, Stephen Hope calls for reports on bugs in Xtal. I wasn&rsquo;t
going to respond because I have had such fun and practical use
from it in the last 3 and a half years that it seems like
treachery to slight it. The program is excellent and it was two
years before I uncovered a single bug. What prompts this letter
is the TWO MINUTES it took to find a bug in the prestigious
M-BASIC. Discussions at my local club suggest that there are
plently more!
</p>
<p>
So, having made it clear that I think that Xtal is in a
class of its own, here is my solitary bug:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
In expotential, the interpreter accepts an expression like
</p>
<p class="indent2">
4.6789**O.5 &nbsp; (O instead of 0)
</p>
<p class="continued">
and returns a value of 1 (ie. the figure to the power zero)
</p>
<p>
Just for the record, the &ldquo;2 minute bug&rdquo; in M-BASIC5, try
this:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="indent2">
10 DEFBL A,B,C<br>
20 A=3:B=4:C=B/A<br>
30 PRINT C
</p>
<p class="continued">
As expected, C prints out as 1.3 recurring to 15 places. Now,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>try
replacing line 10 with &lsquo;DEFINT A,B: DEFBL C&lsquo; and see what
happens &ndash; the last eight places are rubbish! This begs the
question, why do people want double precision? To do maths of
course. What functions does one use in maths? Why the numeric
ones of course. (Yes, like log, sin, etc). And what is only
available in single precision in M-BASIC? Yes, you&rsquo;ve
quessed!!!! Incredible but true, the internal functions are only
single precision &ndash; a PET is as good at maths as that.
</p>
<h3>
Wordease Mods.
</h3>
<p>
Now for something more constructive. Here are the addresses
to change to get Wordease working under CP/M on a Nascom with
its screen mapped to F800H:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-13-2.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
And of course change 1010 to 7D if you have made a Nas&nbsp;sys&nbsp;3
version of MONITOR.COM (what better name for this than
NAS.COM?). With these mods. one can read in old tapes and print
them, or save them to disk using the NAS.COM routines. I am
working on a full CP/M version, perhaps next Xmas...
