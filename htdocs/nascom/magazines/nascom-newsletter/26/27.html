Running NASPIC
</p>
<p>
Like anything 18 takes a bit of getting used to, but once
there it is really quite easy. There&rsquo;s no more tedious mucking
about trying &ldquo;to remember how to get the
&ldquo;funny-bent-thing-wi th-a-bleb-on-the-end out of the keyboard or
having to print strings of CHRS(n). And 1t is FAST.
</p>
<p>
The BASIC program produced consists of 14 lines (ine
numbers in increments of ten) the format of each being&nbsp;:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
&ndash; 47 chars &ndash;
</p>
<p>
Line No.&gt; PRINT
</p>
<p>
NASCOM BASIC doesn&rsquo;t print the graphics characters when
Listed so what you ser 18 &ldquo;garbage&rdquo;. These lines cannot be
edited in BASIC, even with the TOOLKIT as they are too. long.
However, 1t should be possible to edit such lines in BASIC 4c
you have EBASIC by Level 9 Computing. when listing mith this,
UOity program the graphics characters are shown as they wt
be PRINTed and the EDIT command allows the EDITing of BASIC
Tines up to about 700 characters long&rsquo; Of course you can go
back and EDIT them in NASPIC &ndash; probably auch easier.
</p>
<p>
Disadvantages.
</p>
<p>
The advantages are clear, so what are the disadvantages
and/or annoyances&nbsp;? Well the lack of wrap around is certainly a
fuisance and. the lack of use of the normal line editing
facilities of NAS&nbsp;SYS t.e. opening fines. with &lt;SHIFT/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CURSOR
RIGHT? etc. can be frustrating at first as it is usually second
nature to NASCOM onners. But 1 forgive the writer of NASFIC
(Peter West by the way) as it would certainly have complicated
things for him. After all, there are only so many things you can
cram into 2k. A few other annoyances are apparent as described
above.
</p>
<p>
SUMMARY
</p>
<p>
Overall NASPIC is a well presented, easy to use and very
useful graphics package as an adjunct to&rsquo; BASIC programming.
Honever, there is no need to limt it&rsquo;s use to BASIC. It should
be possible to extract the code out of a BASIC program tor use
with machine code programs, etc. It certainly comes a lot
cheaper than some graphics packages for NASCOM BASIC being
advertised at the present time.
