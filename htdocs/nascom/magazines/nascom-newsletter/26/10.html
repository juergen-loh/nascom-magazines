Both sprites and Gf pisel blocks on the pattern plane are
called up by naming their shapes in a table, hence any shapes
which are the same are only defined once with a consequential

fn eight channel eight bit A-D converter is also resident on
the board with eight channels available to the user, read as
I/O ports. These are general purpose and would probably be
used for such things as josticks for games or to read sensors
for contra! applications.

Twin sound generators are included on the board to enable
