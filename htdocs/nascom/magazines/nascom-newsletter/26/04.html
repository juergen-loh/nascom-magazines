ZEAP. If in doubt use Y in ZEAP but it should not be necessary.
zzzz is 2000H for tape or disc ZEAP and 1000H for my EPROM
version. xxyy is the length of the buffer found at 3B00 (yy) and
3B01 (xx) and is always found in the first two bytes of ZEAP
buffers. Adding the length to the start of the buffer produces a
location after an FF (stop byte). Of course the pseudo ops do
not all translate and in both types of file I keep hex
references with leading 0&rsquo;s and trailing H&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t drop &rsquo;en &ndash;
your H&rsquo;s that is.

<p>
Meanwhile, back in NAS-ASS &ndash; one bother is removing lines
with shift and cursor because empty lines are not entered with
the enter key. This may not be obvious till assembly or re-entry
to text edit mode. Use CTRL&nbsp;K to be sure. I usually spray edit
commands all over the text and then struggle to recall why I
used the LDIR mnemonic. What cruel set of circumstances
conspired to create this as an editor directive?
</p>
<p>
The put instruction does not cope if the last line of the
inserting code is consequitive with the insertion line.
</p>
<p>
In the manual LSB and MSB pseudo ops are the LSB (Least
Significant Boob). The op itself actually inserts one code byte
into the program, what a strange device!
</p>
<p>
If, like me, you wish to assign any variable with one byte
for INT vectors then the LET will let (ha) you &ndash; eventually.
</p>
<dl class="indent2" style="text-justify: none">
<dt>LET</dt><dd>LOBYTE=INTLAB &amp; 0FFH &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;easy</dd>
<dt>LET</dt><dd>HIBYTE=((INTLAB &amp; 0FF00H)/256) &amp; 0FFH &nbsp; ;phew</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Points to remember are that division rounds off after and
puts F&rsquo;s in the high byte hence the &amp; 0FFH
</p>
<p>
Now, let me fill you in the rest of the Editor (not you
Ed).
</p>
<p class="indent">
ASCII &amp; MAP &ndash; remind you of codes for keys and display &ndash; nice
touch that.
</p>
<p class="indent">
CONSTRUCT &ndash; pulls raw data from memory and enters it as DEFB
or DEFW &ndash; very useful.
</p>
<p class="indent">
D &amp; H &ndash; allows decimal to hex and back to be worked out before
committing to text. Both these are useful and better than one
alone.
</p>
<p class="indent">
ZTC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CTZ &ndash; converts to and from ZEAP format (with caution).<br>
EDIT &ndash; text edit mode is screen based, mostly cursor
controlled. Lines are not numbered on screen like ZEAP but one
line number is displayed for the cursor position. Mixed views
here.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Find instructions do work well and can be repeated.
</p>
<p class="indent">
Block move commands do well (with one reservation).
</p>
<p class="indent">
/ &ndash; loads and executes any file in editor. Some commands (but
not all those you would expect) are repeated in the assembler
which is an overlay from disc.
