existing software. I would particularly like to mention Business,
and Leisure&rsquo;s PASCLDOS, which in conjunction with our existing
Pascal provides many useful toolkit and disc access operations.
Having used this recently I can vouch for its performance &ndash; a
really well produced item. Documentation conforms to the present
(but not necessarily future) A5 format of the Pascal manual &ndash;
but I don&rsquo;t think much of the cartoon on the front cover! As
that is the only criticism I can level at present I think it
speaks for itself.

<p>
Incidentally it is definitely a more polished DOS extension
than the one which we offer ourselves.
</p>
<p>
B and L have also produced some NAS-PEN extensions (by a
different author). While these are quite effective and are well
implemented I personally much prefer the entirely new SPEX
package &ndash; B &amp; L prefer their extensions, so perhaps you should
wait for an unbiased review of both elsewhere in this magazine
in the future!
</p>
<p>
As well as NAS-DOS we fully support the standard CP/M
version 2.2, and we have available a number of extremely
powerful software packages. More information on these another
time.
</p>
<p>
Look out for more news on applications software in the
future &ndash; remember that we will be producing more software for
NAS&ndash;DOS and CP/M for use on our computers and disc drives.

3. MANOR
</h3>
<p>
There is little to report on this occassion. I have received
two reports of a problem with the CReate option of HINTON,
although I have not yet been able to produce the reported fault
(an NF error) myself. When this is located a revised copy of the
MANOR disc will be issued to all registered owners. This will
include a number of minor changes witch increase the speed of
operation. In particular a version for those of you using a
short key field (typically 10 characters or less) will be
provided, which can dramatically improve the time required to
load the index file initially. A revised version of REBUILD is
also planned which should be of considerable help to those with
very large files who have the misfortune to corrupt their index
file.

<p>
If you wish to use the suggested method of creating an empty
file which forms the structure for a standard application (eg
parts list), and then copy this whenever you need to start a
new file I would make one useful suggestion. It is much easier
and quicker to copy an empty file structure using the NAS-DOS
utility FILCPY than to use the CReate option of HINTON. The
CReate facility 1s really intended for those cases where you
wish to change the structure of the file.

A few users do not seem to have appreciated the use of the
second disc &ndash; as specified when you answer the &lsquo;Data file disc
umber?&rsquo; prompt. To enable you to create data files occupying
