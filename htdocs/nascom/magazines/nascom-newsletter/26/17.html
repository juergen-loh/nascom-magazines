address select switches. When held low (normal) they allow
normal address selection to your preferred address. When high
all address bits will be high, ie. F000H for CP/M.

Fig.&nbsp;3 shows the schematic diagram (you can work out the
physical layout yourselves) for the Auto Reset on switch over.
The circuit provides a low pulse to the Reset line whenever the
state of the control line changes. The length of the pulse has
been made quite long to ensure that the normal Reset timing
capacitor is fully discharged. If reset of your ports is not
required then the reset can go direct to the CPU, Bus pin 14
which is much faster and therefore safer. (Funny arrangement
that&nbsp;&ndash; the <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>&rsquo;s are not reset by the CPU reset line on power
up, only when you press the reset switch!!).

Figs. 4, 5 &amp; 6 show the various things that can be done with
the BASIC ROM and Workspace RAM sockets to use up the spare
locations. (I put my Workspace RAM in the BASIC socket and the
CP/M ROM in the X ROM socket mainly for ease of changing the
CP/M ROM later&nbsp;&ndash; it&rsquo;s more accessible (in my system) and it does
not require mods to the socket or wiring direct to the ROM&rsquo;s
pins.
