Nascom&nbsp;2 and S serial printer connections

<p>
Serial printers (and keyboard terminals) are connected to
the Nascom&nbsp;2 via the PL2 connector. External connection to the
computer should use a 25-way D-type socket, which is connected

Pin @ of PLZ should be connected ta TPS on the rear of the board
for use as a &ldquo;handshake&rdquo; line.

4 The printer handshake at this pin ts only at TTL (3 vale?
level. Since many printers use a 12 volt handshake connect the
grey wire from pin @ to a diode (eg IN4001), the ather end of
which is connected to another diode and a 1K resistor. The other
nd of the Second diode is connected to pin 7 of the D-type, and
the other end of the resistor is connected to pin 20 of the
D-type. The cathodes of the diodes (usually marked with a bar)
are connected together. This. is the connector configuration
fitted ay standard on Nascom&nbsp;3.

<p>
* These connections are suitable for the normal printers
operating on RS232 and V24 signal levels, 16 +12V and &ndash;12V. For
Printers using ZOmA current. loop the input to the computer
Should be connected to PL2 pin G instead of 3, and the 20a
output to PL2 pin IZ instead of 6

The recommended connection between the Nascom&nbsp;3 parallel PIO
port, PL4, and an external connector is by seans of a Scotchflex
fable, using a2 25-may &lsquo;D-type&rsquo; socket for the external
connection. The D-type should also be of Stotchflex type, the
