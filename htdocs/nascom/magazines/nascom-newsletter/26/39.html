<h4>
Nascom&nbsp;2 and S serial printer connections
</h4>
<p>
Serial printers (and keyboard terminals) are connected to
the Nascom&nbsp;2 via the PL2 connector. External connection to the
computer should use a 25-way D-type socket, which is connected
to PL2 as follows:

<tr><th>PL2<br>Pin</th><th>D-type<br>Pin</th><th>Function</th><th>Colour</th></tr>

<tr><td>8 **</td><td>7</td><td>Printer handshake</td><td>Grey</td></tr>

<p>
Pin 8 of PL2 should be connected to TP3 on the rear of the board
for use as a &lsquo;handshake&rsquo; line.
</p>
<p>
** The printer handshake at this pin is only at TTL (5 volt)
level. Since many printers use a 12 volt handshake connect the
grey wire from pin 8 to a diode (eg 1N4001), the other end of
which is connected to another diode and a 1K resistor. The other
end of the second diode is connected to pin 7 of the D-type, and
the other end of the resistor is connected to pin 20 of the
D-type. The cathodes of the diodes (usually marked with a bar)
are connected together. This is the connector configuration
fitted as standard on Nascom&nbsp;3.
</p>
<p>
* These connections are suitable for the normal printers
operating on RS232 and V24 signal levels, ie +12V and &ndash;12V. For
printers using 2OmA current loop the input to the computer
should be connected to PL2 pin 9 instead of 3, and the 20mA
output to PL2 pin 12 instead of 6.

<h4>
Nascom&nbsp;2 and 3 parallel port connections
</h4>
<p>
The recommended connection between the Nascom&nbsp;3 parallel PIO
port, PL4, and an external connector is by means of a Scotchflex
cable, using a 25-way &lsquo;D-type&rsquo; socket for the external
connection. The D-type should also be of Scotchflex type, the
