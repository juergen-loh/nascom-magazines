Editorial.

<p>
Christmas comes but once a year but it looks as though I&rsquo;ve
managed to miss it with this bumper Christmas issue. Most of the
magazine was put together before Christmas but, unfortunately,
due to circumstances beyond my control, (ie. the Christmas
rush), I didn&rsquo;t get chance to get it finished and sent out for
Christmas as I had intended. I hope you all had a happy
Christmas and a very merry New Year.
</p>
<p>
The results of the survey that I did a couple of issues back
are coming in now and they are giving me some idea of what you
want to see in the magazine. In general they seem very
encouraging but I think I had better clear up a few points:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="number-dot justify">
<li>
We are totally seperate from Nascom. Nascom (or rather
Lucas Logic) have given us there full support and backing
but Micro Power Ltd still maintain full editorial control.
The section of the magazine under &lsquo;Nascom News&rsquo; is supplied
by Lucas and goes into the magazine unedited in content but
the rest of the magazine is made up of a representative
selection of the articles that I receive from readers.
</li>
<li>
Quite a large percentage of the replies to the survey
commented on the unprofessional finish to the magazine.
This is because the magazine is unprofessional. I would
much rather use a daisy wheel printer for printing and have
the circuit diagrams done professionally but this would
involve expenditure which the magazine could not pay for.
The magazine is produced very much on a voluntary/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>amateur
basis so if any reader has circuit drawing experience I
would be very happy to make contact with him/her and
possibly come up with some working agreement.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I will give you more results of the survey, hopefully, in
the next issue.

<h3>
Subscriptions.
</h3>
<p>
This is the last issue of Volume 2 of the Nascom
Newsletter/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Micropower magazine. This year (1983) I intend to
produce 6 issues on a regular basis (I am getting properly
organised) with a more consistant balance of news, reviews,
hints and letters. I am hoping to set up a section for queries
about problems on the the Nascom and related products which I
can forward on to the party concerned for a detailed answer
which I will be able to print in a subsequent issue. I don&rsquo;t
know if this will work but I won&rsquo;t know until I have tried.
</p>
<p>
I am afraid that the cost of the magazine will have to go up
for Volume 3 and the cost now will be &pound;1.25 per issue or &pound;7.50
for a subscription (4 issues) (Europe and Overseas rates are
also increased; see the enclosed subscription form for details).
The magazine NEEDS subscriptions. We are offering a &pound;2 discount
(that works out at &pound;5.50 for 6 issues of the magazine sent
anywhere in Great Britain) an the subscription if you also order
some Micro Power software/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>hardware at the same time, before the
21st of Feb.
