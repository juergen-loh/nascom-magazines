strangest omission is the macro that we all know and love. It
isnot possible to define w macro in memory and invoke it by
hane elsewhere let alone use dummy arguments. If Mr. Watwon 12
reading this in Bedford I wauld buy an&rdquo; update or extension
doing this.

<p>
ORG/PHASE allows code to be generated to run at PHASE but
Loaded at ORG for PROM blowing. Nice touch.

PRS &ndash; al! RST&rsquo;s are handled by name but PRS drops the 00 byte
an for you- the manual doesn&rsquo;t say that though:
</p>
<p>
One last idiosyncracy &ndash; mnemonics which load a twa byte
value intoa one byte register cause a fatal error. Most
assemblers I bow pull the first byte and wart only.
</p>
<p>
In summary 1 would say a very good assembler but it was a
urench loosing the line numbers &lsquo;and display of errors mhile
editing, ae im ZAP.
</p>
<p>
With any system the most disappointing things are not its
limtatione but the errors in the manual. The errors here are
few and fairly minor but frustrating til) you know thee

Now something else that came to 1ight via the same stable is
that the Nascom&nbsp;3 CPU board has a link from test point 3 to pin

Gn the serial port connector and you won&rsquo;t find that in the
manual. This is for the printer busy signals to run in the same
Cable as the serial data. To make 18 work for RS2S2 Unstead oF
TTL handshaking) you Need a Ik? resistor and two IN4148 diodes
at the D connector.

DF course, its no use unless the software handles it but
this routine does &ndash; provided you have executed 0C0H and Uo is
invoked to turn it an. iN turne it off).
