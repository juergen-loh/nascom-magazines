with an option table asking which piece of Nascom software was
required to be printed, with the option of a second menu to
select the various output options, ie. is a title required, page
number, etc. Later, both option tables were included on the
first screen. At this stage there was the option of using the
keyboard as a conventional typewriter but this was removed as
the Nas-sys &lsquo;H&rsquo; command was almost identical.

<p>
With the arrival of the Epson I suddenly began to see things
in a different light. I knew that this particular printer was
selling very well in the U.K., therefore, quite a number of
Nascom owners were likely to purchase one. Consequently, I
thought my little program, along with some changes to suit the
Epson, might make a good magazine article.
</p>
<p>
There followed a very intensive period of programming to try
and get the best out of the Epson and so what was initially a
relatively simple program soon began to grow into something
rather more involved. Allied to the fact that it was also being
directed towards other Nascom users, it also had to be very easy
to use.
</p>
<p>
It wasn&rsquo;t until I reached the part of the program that dealt
with Naspen that my problems began. The Epson printer had the
potential for correspondance quality printing as well as many
functions like changing the print size etc. Obviously, for my
own benefit, I wanted to make the most of the printers
capabilities. So, I began looking at the larger wordprocessor
systems to find out what facilities they offered in the area of
text formatting and soon discovered that printer control codes
embedded in the text was the thing to do. By trapping each
character output from Naspen, embedded control codes can be
intercepted&nbsp;, executed and then the codes deleted from the
printed text. There were several decisions to be made at this
point about the form that the embedded code should take and how
to seperate the codes from the text. I eventually settled on
using &lt;&gt; brackets to enclose the code but also made allowance
for this to be changed if required. The parameters to be passed
on to Nasprint-80 from the text could be in decimal as the
program already had a routine to convert decimal to binary which
has used in the page format parameters table, eg page length.
But, there was still the problem of how to control the printer.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way, from the users point of view, would be to
have a series of commands that performed specific functions in
the printer. Unfortunately, the 2K set aside for the program was
filling up rapidly and there was not enough room for a table the
size that would be required for the Epson. Also, printer codes
used on the Epson may perform different functions on other
printers. Because of these problems I opted to simply output the
hex. value preceeded by the output command, eq. &lt;o 1B 45&gt;. This
command will tell the Epson to start printing in emphasised
characters. Great, I had basically everything that I needed, but
what happens if, in typing in a control code, you miss the
bracket from the end&nbsp;? ...@!!*%'&pound;! There was obviously a need
for some form of error detection.
