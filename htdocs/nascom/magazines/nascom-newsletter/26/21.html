Why Nasprint-80?

To begin with, what is Nasprint-80 or, to give it the full
title, Nascom Printer Drive and Formatting Package for the Epson
MX80? Basically, it is an attempt to direct the printed outputs
from all of the standard Nascom software, eg. NASDIS, ZEAP, etc,
through a common printer drive routine, from which the text or
listings etc. can be printed and formatted into pages as
required. The most important criterium being ease-of-use while
giving it maximum flexibility. But, before giving a detailed
description of what Nasprint 80 can do, it may be of interest to
a number of people to know how the program began and was
subsequently developed.

<p>
Like many people. I expect, who built their Nascom&nbsp;2 and
eventually got it working, there was a problem of what to do
with it after the Martians had finally invaded Earth. I decided
that it would be worthwhile to equip myself with a printer and,
as it happened, an Olivetti TE 300 teleprinter came my way. With
small hardware addition to the printer, I was able to write a
short program to drive the printer through the Nascom PIO and
was quite delighted when some totally illegible garbage was
printed, which, incidently, was different to the garbage that
was typed in. Still, it was a start. In fact, that was the
beginning of Nasprint-80, although I was unaware of it at the
time.
</p>
<p>
The teleprinter drive routine was my first attempt at
machine code programming although I had purchased a copy of
ZEAP, NASDIS and DEHUG some time earlier with the intention of
finding out what it was all about having grown tired of using
BASIC. My only machine code experience prior to this was finding
the bugs in a certain games program, O***llo, published by one
of the national mags. So, armed with a couple of boots and some
articles on assembly language programming, I set about writing
program that would allow me to output listings and text from any
of the standard software with the relevant output addresses
being changed automatically.
</p>
<p>
Well, initially, progress was painfully slow with even the
most simple tasks taking sometimes days to achive, only to give
way to a better idea later on. A great deal of knowledge was
gained from the assembly listings provided with the Nascom
software, without which, I am sure you would not be reading this
now. Unfortunately, the program&rsquo;s development stopped frequently
because of problems with the teleprinter, it not doing as it was
told. Eventually, after about 6 months, it gave way to an Epson
MX80 as I was spending all my time keeping the printer working,
ultimately failing. However, by this time the program had
developed to about 1k, half of that being tables and option
menus, but the basic framework was formed.
