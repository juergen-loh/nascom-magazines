NEWS FROM NASCOM
</h1>
<p>
Now that there is an outlet for information via Nascom News
we shall be using this an the future to notify you of new
developments and to pass on information about existing products.
Consequently NAS-DOS and MANOR owners should watch these pages
for their future news of these products, rather than receiving
their own special newsletters.
</p>
<p>
A number of items appear in this issue directed towards
existing software owners. We are also bringing you news of
changes in documentations information an some hardware standards
and more information on the AVL (Advanced Video Controller).
</p>
<p>
If you would like to suggest any topics for inclusion in
these pages please drop us a line.

<u>1. Nascom documentation</u>
</h3>
<p>
We are making strenuous efforts to improve both the content
and presentation of our manuals (no rude comments please). As a
result we will be introducing a set of 8 uniform A4 size ring
binders (4 rings to stop the usual problem of the punched holes
wearing and the pages becoming dog-eared). Each will cover a
specific topic of hardware and/or software. Manuals for
individual software packages will be supplied pre-punched ready
for insertion in the appropriate volume (or in your own binders
if you prefer). In the case of volume 1 (Nascom&nbsp;3) and volume 6
(the <?php externalLink("AVC","",""); ?>)
which refer to a single product the binder will be
supplied with the product. You will be able to buy these binders
separately from your dealer, together with all the individual
manuals, if you wish to update to the new standards.
