Since the release of the tape version of Nascom Enhanced
BASIC a number of minor problems have come to light, both in the
interpreter and the manual. These have now all been corrected,
but if you have one of the earlier copies you should check
whether the following bugs have been corrected. When you have
made any necessary corrections you should save a new copy using
the W1000 4200 command in NAS-SYS (remember you should not copy
over your original in case you made a mistake making these
changes!)

<h4>
<u>4.1 Keyboard operation</u>
</h4>
<p>
KBD and KBD$ only work for shifted characters.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
Modify 1439 (was 38) to 20
</p>
<p>
Auto repeat works correctly with INCH, but not with KBD.
This is due to the fast keyboard check that is used between
statements. You can enable auto-repeat with KBD as follows:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
Modify 3A4F (was E3) to FE
</p>
<p>
Note, however, that this slows down execution by about 10%
and so should be used with care and certainly NOT as a permanent
modification.
</p>
<h4>
<u>4.2 ON ERR GOSUB</u>
</h4>
<p>
An error occurs after ON ERR GOSUB which results in a return
to the monitor.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
Modify 1652 (was C1) to: FE 90 20 18 2A 57 10 C1 C5 F5
7E B7 20 04 23 23 23 23 23 F1 E5 2A 51 10 E5 F5 33 C5
</p>
<h4>
<u>4.3 Tape system</u>
</h4>
<p>
Verify fails on data files of only one block length.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
Modify 37DB (was 38) to 18 03
</p>
<p>
Tape loading and verification leaves the tape LED lit after
an error has occurred.
</p>
<p class="indent2">
Modify 3D53 (was CD) to 38 41<br>
Modify 3D78 (was CD) to 38 41<br>
Modify 4138 (was 00) to DF 5F C3 CD 15
</p>
<h4>
<u>4.4 RND function</u>
</h4>
<p>
The use of RND with a real argument of between 0 and 1,
while of no particular use, causes the system to lock-up. In
addition the use of negative numbers in the arguments (also of
no particular use) returns a constant, rather than giving the
error which it should.
