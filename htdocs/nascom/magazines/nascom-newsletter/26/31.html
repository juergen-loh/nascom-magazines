OF these manuals the whole of volume 1 is completely new
except for the NAS-SYS&nbsp;3 manual, which is merely a reprint using
daisy wheel printer. In almost all cases the manuals will be
typed using a daisy wheel printer with a standard type face
(prestige elite at 12 characters per inch, 70 characters per
line). So far the MANOR and NAS-CALC manuals have also been
reprinted in the standard format, and others will follow in due
course. NAS-DOS will probably be the next to be tackled, and
will involve re-writing some sections. Incidentally most of the
manuals are now being prepared using the SPEX word processor.
NAS-PEN will continue to be available and is a super word
processor for its size, but for the NAS-DOS owner SPEX does have
a number of advantages (see the next section!).

<u>2. NAS-DOS &ndash; Pascal and SPEX</u>
</h3>
<p>
NAS-DOS is our own low cost disc operating system, and is
compatible with all our NAS-SYS software &ndash; ROM BASIC, NAS-PEN,
ZEAP, NAS-DIS and Pascal. In addition we are adding new
applications software to increase the versatility of the
machine. All this software is priced very modestly, and
therefore we think that for many users with a limited budget
NAS-DOS is an attractive proposition compared with CP/M. At the
moment we have already released NAS-CALC (a spread sheet
program) and MANOR (a data base manager).

SPEX is a powerful word processor package intended for the
disc user. It is loaded into RAM, and occupies about 12K. It is
not intended as a replacement for NAS-PEN, which with its
compact size and availability on EPROM is particularly suited to
the cassette user (although as we have said already it can be
used perfectly successfully with NAS-D0S). The particular
advantages of SPEX are:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Greatly extended editing functions, and NAS-SYS compatible use
of the cursor
</p>
<p class="indent">
Improved (and variable within the text) width and margin inset
facilities
</p>
<p class="indent">
Scrolling via the cursor (it never goes off-screen!)
</p>
<p class="indent">
Automatic paging
</p>
<p class="indent">
Elimination of the need to perform a formatting operation
</p>
<p class="indent">
Generally no need to hyphenate &ndash; and then have to change
hyphenation if the text is changed
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the editor asked for this contribution to be
produced using NAS-PEN, so on this occassion I have had to go
back to that package. However for ease of use most of the new
manuals are prepared using SPEX.
