Dear Sir,
You ask for comment about the future content of Scorpio Mews.
</p>
<p>
My interest is solely Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Map, 1 have no intention of deserting the
ship to buy an IBM contempeible, as the P/M Users&rdquo; Group calle then.
</p>
<p>
I would gladly pay # higher sub to keep the firm afloat, but I realise that
</p>
<p>
othere may be lees fortunate financially than I.
</p>
<p>
Us de essential that the sole remaining 40-105 magazine survives. If lovert
the standards to include articles on ibMs black gox and ite relatives will de
ther then J will come slong reluctantly, But Lf you do so I truce that the
articles will really get down to brase tacks and not Just review programs.
</p>
<p>
ALL of the IBM users T know seem perfectly happy when all goes well. But when
Things go awry none of them, end that includes the people who market the be
tofhave the faintest idea what makes the hardware or the software tick.

&lsquo;The recent comments in Scorpio News on the subject of c
do some thinking about ay own situation. Just @ short years ago By 4
from heavy current to electronics. My electronics training had been obtained in
the days Of valves. The magazines were full of articles on computing, and T
thought Thad batter learn about 4t too. T bought # HASCOM 1, which worked on
twitch on, and I wae hooked. On che basis of readaye supplier &lsquo;might be benkrupt
tomorrow&rdquo; (especially after the WASCOM saga), I bought anything new that I could
afford, and acquired &laquo; NASCOM&nbsp;2, diske &ndash; a m 40K, &lsquo;DISKPEN etc; and
gerly awaited the &lsquo;80 Col x25 Row&rsquo; screen that certain DRH told me
coming &lsquo;soon.

Over the years T have continued to expand the aysten as costs allowed and I hat

all comments support the view that they are good, and well supported with date

For my part, I have, Like several other correspondents, a good knowledge of the
