CP/M&nbsp;3 directory hashing
</p>
<p>
The HASH parameter contains the address of a table used for directory
hashing. Hashing is a term used to refer to the process of converting a string
of characters into a single number that Ls unique to that string. There are
Vast umber of methods of doing this, ail varying in complexity. The probl
encountered with hashing are guaranteeing that the mumber produced is in fact
unique to the pareicular string involved (and no other) while Keeping the number

</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The problem of uniqueness can be explained with the use of an example. A
simple vay of converting a character string into a number fe to add the ASCII
&lsquo;combinations of tha characters A.D
</p>
<p>
selon of those characters that will give the
fers to Fepeat, the aumber of combinations
till further. A fev examples are given
</p>
<p>
One solution to thie problem is to weight the character values differently
depending upon which position they occupy in the string. If we were to sssign
values to the characters such that Avl, Bez ete., and multiply the character
eigen! by sulttplea&rsquo; of 27 depending upon eneir positon, &ldquo;the sane strings

Thie example is fine it goer but we want to hash a directory
entry of 11 characters | Using the method described above, the Jowest number
reduced will be 1496 for a file &ldquo;AAAAMMAA.AAAY and the highest number will be
686 for file *227z2222.202&rdquo; However, filenames can also contain figures,
&lsquo;Spaces and some other charactere in addition to upper case letters. CP/M E&para;
Reeds to include the user area byte and both extent bytes (EXT and 82) #0 that
ie can digferentiate between files with the same oame in different user areas
and also between different extents of the same file, ALL of this serves to
Increase che range of numbers ult of hashing.
