consequently doesn&rsquo;t require buffers where the physical sector size is 128 bytes
(Blocking and Deblocking are discussed later). When used, CP/M&nbsp;3 discards these
buffers and overwrites the date in them on a least recently used (LRU) basis so
that when access is required to a recently used sector, CP/M&nbsp;3 reads the data
from memory rather than from the disk giving an appropriate increase in
performance. CP/M&nbsp;3 doesn&rsquo;t use the buffers at all if it knows that one or more
complete physical sectors are to be read and hence deblocking of the data will
not be required. In this case, the BIOS is instructed to read the disk data
directly to the TPA at the DMA address.

<h3>
CP/M&nbsp;3 directory hashing
</h3>
<p>
The HASH parameter contains the address of a table used for directory
hashing. Hashing is a term used to refer to the process of converting a string
of characters into s single number that is unique to that string. There are a
vast number of methods of doing this, ail varying in complexity. The problems
encountered with hashing are guaranteeing that the number produced is in fact
unique to the particular string involved (and no other) while keeping the number
small enough to be manageable.
</p>
<p>
The problem of uniqueness can be explained with the use of an example. A
simple way of converting a character string into a number is to add the ASCII
values of the characters together. Taking combinations of the characters A-D
for simplicity, there are 16 permutations of those characters that will give the
same result. If we then permit characters to repeat, the number of combinations
giving identical results increases still further. A few examples are given
below, values are in decimal:
</p>
<p class="indent">
&ldquo;ABCD&rdquo; = 65 + 66 + 67 + 68 = 266<br>
&ldquo;BDAC&rdquo; = 66 + 68 + 65 + 67 = 266<br>
&ldquo;AADD&rdquo; = 65 + 65 + 68 + 68 = 266<br>
&ldquo;ACCC&rdquo; = 65 + 67 + 67 + 67 = 266
</p>
<p>
One solution to this problem is to weight the character values differently
depending upon which position they occupy in the string. If we were to assign
values to the characters such that A=1, B=2 etc., and multiply the character
values by multiples of 27 depending upon their position, the same strings as we
used above would give different results as shown below:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;ABCD&rdquo; = 1 + (2 * 27) + (3 * 54) + (4 * 81) = 541
&ldquo;BDAC&rdquo; = 2 + (4 * 27) + (1 * 54) + (3 * 81) = 407
&ldquo;AADD&rdquo; = 1 + (1 * 27) + (4 * 54) + (4 * 81) = 568
&ldquo;ACCC&rdquo; = 1 + (3 * 27) + (3 * 54) + (3 * 81) = 487
</p>
<p>
This example is fine as far as it goes but we want to hash a directory
entry of 11 characters. Using the method described above, the lowest number
produced will be 1486 for as file &ldquo;AAAAAAA.AAA&rdquo; and the highest number will be
28636 for file &ldquo;ZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ&rdquo;. However, filenames can also contain figures,
spaces and some other characters in addition to upper case letters. CP/M&nbsp;3
needs to include the user area byte and both extent bytes (EXT and S2) so that
it can differentiate between files with the same name in different user areas
and also between different extents of the same file. All of this serves to
increase the range of numbers generated as a result of hashing.
</p>
<p>
In CP/M&nbsp;3, Digital Research hash the file name, user area and extent bytes
into a four byte number which constitutes the hash table entry for the directory
entry. The user area number is stored as the 4 least significant bits (lsbs) of
the first byte. The file name is reduced to an 18 bit number of which the lower
16 bits are stored in the two middle bytes of the hash table entry and the 2
most significant bits (msbs) are stored in the 2 msbs of the first byte. The
extent and S2 bytes are combined to form a directory entry number for the file
such that the first entry number is 0 and directory entry number &lsquo;n&rsquo; is numbered
a-1. This entry number is truncated to form a 9 bit value and is stored so that
the msb is held as the 6th bit (bit 5) of the first byte of the hash table entry
and the lower 8 bits are stored in the last byte. The method of hashing used on
