<h3>
<u>Pluto IBM Range</u>
</h3>
<p>
This board is a standard IBM format board for use in PC, XT, AT and compatibles.
The usual

features and options ere included in the range:

<h3>
<u>On-board Processors</u>
</h3>
<p>
So far all of the boards described have had on-board processors and control
ROMs. This approach has allowed Io to give all of the boards the same base
commend set, and at the same time has allowed them to use different on-board
CPUs and graphics display controllers. For example, Pluto 1 and 1A use an 8088
plus 6845, Pluto 2 an 8088 plus NEC7220, and Pluto IBM uses a 68000 CPU.
Despite these hardware differences this technique means that many programs
written to drive one Pluto model will aleo drive other models, and means that
programmers don&rsquo;t have to totally relearn commands, just modifying their
programs to take advantage of more colours, more screens, or whatever.
</p>
<p>
The arrival of the Hitachi BD63484 ACRTC graphics processor caused s major re-think
of this approach. This chip is much more powerful than the other graphics
chips so far mentioned, and to add a CPU plus ROM between this and the host
system could prove very limiting. So the new Pluto Pennant range, based on the
63484, have this chip interfaced directly to the bus.
</p>
<p>
(Incidental information: The Gemini 68K-BUS graphics boards also use the 63484,
again directly interfaced to the bus.)
</p>
<p>
To maintain software compatibility with other Pluto boards, Io have written the
PGI (Pluto Graphics Interface) driver. Basically this accepts the standard
Pluto commend set, and converts it as appropriate to drive the actual board
attached. Again, this means that as far as the programmer is concerned there is
consistency across the entire Pluto range, a very attractive feature when you
have spent man-months writing software for a board that gets replaced by
another!

<u>Pluto Pennant</u>

<p>
As already mentioned, this board range is for PC, XT, AT, and compatibles. All
provide flicker-free non-interlaced displays. Hardware pan and zoom, colour
palette, and DMA access are supported.

<u>Software Demo</u>
</h3>
<p>
So far I&rsquo;ve just run through the various hardware available. (Oh, I should add
that Io also supply colour monitors, video cameras, film recorders, printers,
etc.) But all this fancy hardware is obviously of little use without software.
Many OEM customers (Original Equipment Manufacturers) take Pluto products, and
write their own software for their own specific applications. But Io also have
various software packages available, and I was shown one of these.

This is &ldquo;a sophisticated art and design package aimed at almost everyone in the
business of visual arts&rdquo;. Like many packages of this type it uses two monitors.
