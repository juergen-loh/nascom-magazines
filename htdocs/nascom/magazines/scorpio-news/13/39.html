This bonrd is a standard 18M format board for use 1n PC, XT, AT and compatibles.

On-board Processors
</p>
<p>
So far all of the boards described have had on-board processors and control
</p>
<p>
ROMe. This approach has allowed To to give ail of the boards the same base
</p>
<p>
command tet, and at the tame tine hae allowed then touse different on-board
</p>
<p>
GPUs and graphice display controllers. For example, Pluto 1 and 1A use an 60
</p>
<p>
plus 6643,&rdquo; piaco 2)an 089 plus Nec7220, and Fiuto IaH uses a 66000 CPU.

Programe to take advants

<p>
The arrival of the Hitach{ HD634G4 ACRIC graphics processor ca
think of this approach. This chip is much more powerful chan the other graphi:
chips eo far mentioned, and to edd a CPU plus HOM between this and the host
Syetem could prove very limiting. 50 the new Pluto Pennant range, based on the
63404, have thie chip interfaced directly to the bus.

(Incidental information: The Gemini 68X-BUS graphics boards also use che 63484,
sin directly interfaced to the bus&rsquo;)

Por (Pluto Graphice Interface) driver. Basically this accepts the standard
Plute command set, and converte it ae appropriate to drive the actual board
