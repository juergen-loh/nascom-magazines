discrete trimming of the signon messages might help. These are usually output
until a 0 is found.
</p>
<p>
If the BIOS source code is available, the modifications can be made tidier. The
extra code could be added just before signon messages are printed, and the extra
data could be placed after the jump to warmboot, but before the actual signon
message.
</p>
<p>
The code listed is really ALL that is needed to implement Z3, but it is rather
obscured in the Z3 installation instructions. It consists of about 45 bytes of
Z80 code and about 75 bytes of data, which could be trimmed by some 20 bytes if
desired by removal of the Z3 welcome message that is included in the startup
command string. You can be more elaborate if you wish, but there is no need.
</p>
<p>
Note that if segments are loaded to memory from disk files by LDR.COM, the
SYS.ENV segment MUST be loaded first if it is not already present, since LDR.COM
then refers to it to find out where to load the other segments.

<h3>
Installation without BIOS modifications.
</h3>
<p>
If the Z3 segments and buffers are loaded from the system tracks of a Winchester
or Floppy, all that is needed in the cold boot is to set the Wheel byte, and
path unless they are also defined in the system track area, for example in the
spare space in the TCAP.
</p>
<p>
In the case where insufficient system track space is available, and BIOS
modifications are to be avoided, there seems to be a possible solution. During
implementation of Z3 on a friend's Alphatronic PC, I had booted a system that
loaded the segments and initialized the buffers, and Z3 was running. A little
later I booted, by mistake, a disk that did not have LDR.COM or any of the SYS
segment files on it, but did have e Z3 CCP in the system on the system tracks.
When this disk booted, I got the error message:
</p>
<p class="indent">
&lsquo;LDR SYS.ENV,SYS.NDR,SYS,RCP?&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
since these files could not be found or loaded. When Z3 commands were given
however, they all worked correctly, since all necessary data was in RAM already
from the previous BOOT. So, provided they have not been corrupted, it is
sufficient to get the Z3 segments, etc, into RAM only once, on the initial Cold
boot. They do NOT need to be reloaded unless they are later corrupted for some
reason. This suggests that the problem can be solved as follows.
</p>
<p>
A CP/M system is created that has the CCP, BDOS and BIOS at the same addresses
as the Z3 system, but with a CCPZ or ZCPR Vers. 1 CCP. This can be booted, and
will it will not use RAM in the area to be used by Z3 segments and buffers. The
&lsquo;GET&rsquo; command of this CCP then can be used to load a complete Z3 composite
&lsquo;SEGMENT.BIT&rsquo; file from the disk to the Z3 RAM area. (This could be made an
auto run command.) Once this file has been loaded, a disk with a Z3 CCP in the
system track can be booted, and it will find everything ready in RAM when it
starts up. Alternative ways of loading the &lsquo;SEGNEMT.BIT&rsquo; might also be devised,
such as loading and relocating from the Z3 boot disk itself. The method
described above is probably the simplest though. The &lsquo;SEGMENT.BIT&rsquo; file can be
made up in a similar way to that used to build up the Z3 part of a complete
Winchester based system, as will now be described.

Generating a ZCPR3 System for Direct Booting.

<p>
Fig. 1 shows in diagrammatic form a typical Z3 system supporting all features
except redirected I/O. The addresses on the left hand side are those that the
various parts would start at when the system is in RAM. Those on the right are
referenced to a system &lsquo;image&rsquo; file, that is to be written to the system tracks
of a Winchester, and will subsequently load to RAM. Note that these addresses
and those given below represent only one of many possible configurations of CP/M
and Z3.
