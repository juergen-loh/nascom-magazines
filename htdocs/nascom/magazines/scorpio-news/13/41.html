may go there and rent time on any of the equipment, or may send disk files in,

any of the relevant equipment.

<h3>
<u>The Company and its Market</u>
</h3>
<p>
From the above it is fairly obvious that Io doesnâ€™t sell just to the
enthusiastic amateur any more, although some still buy Pluto 1A, which you will
now all agree IS at give-away prices!
</p>
<p>
As I said earlier, Io sell to OEMs who often produce their own software, and
until relatively recently Io did not really bother with software. However, they
now realise that many totally diverse applications have many common
requirements, and they have a number of programmers who specialise in producing
customised versions of Designer for these different markets.
</p>
<p>
Italy has seen the light, and have 300-400 Pluto&nbsp;2 installations in the textile
industry. Here they ere supplied, for example, by a knitting machine
manufacturer to design stockings, tights and socks. By connecting the
Pluto/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>host computer directly to the knitting machine, once a design is completed
a sample sock can appear in 7 SECONDS! Alternatively, the pattern can be dumped
to cassettes, which can then be placed into the other knitting machines on the
shop floor.
</p>
<p>
Another use is in carpet design. The complete Pluto system/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>software in this
application is about &pound;20,000. An American competitor offers a similar product
for &pound;120,000. You see, Io are cheap!
</p>
<p>
Further systems are in use in floor tile, wallpaper, and kitchen unit design.
Io have also recently become involved in a major publishing project.
</p>
<h3>
<u>The Future</u>
</h3>
<p>
Io have certainly come a long way since their original Nascom add-ons. And as
to the future? Well, they say that they have defined 16 specific market areas
(e.g. video, textiles, etc) and will be pursuing most of these. And their
hardware and software products will continue to move up-market, to provide
higher resolutions and higher performance.
