perform better, and would T hope allow continued use of my current well
Understood hardware and software. I hope they hurry up though, before the
market vanish

So, as long as this magazine continuss to support the 80-BUS syets
Sok in content, I would go along with the idea of supporting PC
the basie of &ldquo;Haif-a loaf&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Tf you can&rsquo;t beat them&rsquo;.

Dear sir

You tnvited opinion on the inclusion of I8M-PC related articles in scorpio News
After reading Vol 1 deaue 2, 1 feel ny situation 1 Fairly common, I bought
Nascom&nbsp;2 kit in 1976 end bulle it upto a CP/M system. I work with IBM F&rsquo;s a
Tots however, and wee sitost able sovuse the hascom 0 help in ny work, Dut tot
site. Moden transfer ig messy and slow compared to carrying a floppy disk hone
dnd back and even with the ability to read and write PC dieks on the Nascom, T
Couldn&rsquo;t use a lot of the PC software as it needs a true PC compatible machine
although T have seen #0 Little about
wascom in areas that
(Ihave not yet tried 280M, the MS-DOS
80 emulation program), but the PC hea become ny mainstream machine.

Other than helping witt An the Nascom.

Twat to know that The
articles about how and why the 9; yp ere
geminely interested) vere, for me, a great strength of 6 have not
found an equivalent for the PC.
</p>
<p>
I feel, therefore, that such articles should be included, Po&rsquo;s being the
machines the readership seema to be migrating to. Ass pure 80-BUS sagazine T
feel Scorpio News will not eurvive long term becoming, little by little, less
relevant to the readers&rsquo; activities: Similarly, it should not be a pure TBM PC
Sagazine, I think e combination would beat &lsquo;reflect the way the readership
appears to be golng
</p>
<p>
Continuing the benchmark theme of previous Seaues, I was interested in the
relative speeds of the different PC&rsquo;s (and vher &ldquo;in) and have
some resulte from a simple test program that may be of interest. The program
