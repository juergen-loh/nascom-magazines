perform better, and would I hope allow continued use of my current well
understood hardware and software. I hope they hurry up though, before the
market vanishes.
</p>
<p>
So, as long as this magazine continues to support the 80-BUS systems to at least
50% in content, I would go along with the idea of supporting PC&rsquo;s and Clones, on
the basis of &lsquo;Half a loaf&rsquo;, and &lsquo;If you can&rsquo;t beat them&rsquo;.

Yes to IBM&rsquo;s, plus more on benchmarks

Dear sir
</p>
<p>
You invited opinion on the inclusion of IBM-PC related articles in Scorpio News.
After reading
<a href="../../../12/01/text/#page">Vol&nbsp;1 Issue&nbsp;2</a>,
I feel my situation is fairly common. I bought a
Nascom&nbsp;2 kit in 1976 and built it up to a CP/M system. I work with IBM PS&rsquo;s a
lot, however, and was almost able to use the Nascom to help in my work, but not
quite. Modem transfer is messy and slow compared to carrying a floppy disk home
and back and even with the ability to read and write PC disks on the Nascom, I
couldn&rsquo;t use a lot of the PC software as it needs a true PC compatible machine
to run (I didn&rsquo;t think a GM888 would help, although I have seen so little about
it). I ended up buying a PC AT clone. I do still use the Nascom in areas that
I see not merit in upgrading to the PC (I have not yet tried Z80MU, the MS-DOS
CP/M-80 emulation program), but the PC has become my mainstream machine.
</p>
<p>
Other than helping with work, my interests in the PC are just as in the Nascom.
I want to know that makes it tick and how I can get it to do what I want. The
articles about how and why the system worked (written by people who were
genuinely interested) were, for me, a great strength of 80-BUS News. I have not
found an equivalent for the PC.
</p>
<p>
I feel, therefore, that such articles should be included, PC&rsquo;s being the
machines the readership seems to be migrating to. As a pure 80-BUS magazine I
feel Scorpio News will not survive long term becoming, little by little, less
relevant to the readers&rsquo; activities. Similarly, it should not be a pure IBM PC
magazine. I think a combination would best reflect the way the readership
appears to be going.
</p>
<p>
Continuing the benchmark theme of previous issues, I was interested in the
relative speeds of the different PC&rsquo;s (and where the Nascom fitted in) and have
some results from a simple test program that may be of interest. The program
was written in TURBO Pascal (the only compiler I had for both CP/M and PC-DOS)
and was designed to take exactly 60 seconds on a 8&nbsp;MHz 8088.
