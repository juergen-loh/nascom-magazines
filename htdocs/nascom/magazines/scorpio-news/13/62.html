<p>
&lsquo;Adding 720K drives to an Amstrad
</p>
<p>
one Inet (long) thought, passed on to me by Brian Hayward of Colchester,
for those who own Amatrad i312&Prime;: with one drive and haven&rsquo;t forked out the
necestary for the Technical Manual. Statement: Tf you&rsquo;ve owned a Gemini or
Nascom with S00K disks, bet you&rsquo;re pretty peeved to discover that the maximun
disk capacity of the the Anstead (and most other clones) is only 360K pert. Now
Brian hae bovh; that is, a one drive Amptrad. and the Technical Manual; and he&rdquo;
found a new command for the CONFIG.SYS file (it actually ende up in the
&lsquo;environment string space&rsquo;) and it goes Like thier
</p>
<p>
DRIVPARM&reg;/Didd{ (P:&pound;&pound;/7:te/S:98/M/C/Hshh)
where /D:dd 49 the drive number (0-255)
</p>
<p>
and optionally:
Tice is the number of tracks/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>side (1-999)
JSi6 is the number of sectors/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>erack (1-99)
Hiihh te the aaximin head number (1-99)
Ic indicates changeline (door lock) support required
IM indicates non-renovable block device
JPsEE Andicates the format factor, where:

5.25&Prime;, 1.2 Mbyte

<p>
Zap an 80 track drive in the spare hole and, set DRIVPARM correctly, and
Lo, you have 720K on that drive. Mice, den&rsquo;e it,
</p>
<p>
Bow do you get 720K per disk on an AT?
</p>
<p>
Well T run D0s 3.2, so I tried the above on both my AT clone and one of the
real genuine IBM&nbsp;At&lsquo;s at work with peculiar reeults! Firstly an AT is fltted
with &copy; double sided 80 track dual speed drive, giving 1 7 Mbyte on that drive,
&lsquo;ade up of 15 sectors of 512 bytes/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>track. It cin also double st
Forget about the double speed bit and give the &lsquo;IEM standard&rsquo; 360K, double sided
Go&rsquo;teacks, 9 sectors of 512 bytes/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>track, The enag ia that at 1.2 Mbyte, the
Giaks are expentive, whilst 360K per disk is hardly enough to be weable.
Wouldn&rsquo;e be alce to keep drive Aas 21.2 Hbyte drive, whilst at the same time
using the drive as 720K logical drive at &laquo; different logical address, mainly
because I&rsquo;ve got lots of ordinary disks and very few high density disks. My
</p>
<p>
dcive B.
</p>
<p>
clone is also fitted with&rsquo;s 40 track Teac
</p>
<p>
So first I set the drive parameters for drive A, a0 track 9 sectors/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>track
I used the Amstrad. FORMAT EXE,
</p>
<p>
format program,
&lsquo;apace T Figured that. tt
drives iv had gots&rdquo; The darned thing peid go notice, it still Eormatt
2&rsquo;80 erack, 15 sectors/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>track, that is 1.2 Mbyte, So then 1 tet drive
ck, and 16 and behold, the dear old head
&lsquo;a 40 &lsquo;track drive, the iast 40 steps were
Knocking cop), but che disk reported 720K when it had finished.
Still it proved that removing the 40 track drive and replacing it with an 80
</p>
<p>
track would work, but that defeated ny ain.
