Introduction
</h3>
<p>
&ldquo;In the depths of darkest Harrow there seem to be signs of movement. From
the dark, damp quagmire, a creature, in perhaps it&rsquo;s most primitive guise stirs,
and may be seen to be emerging from the mists which for many months have clouded
the clear insight of the vision of that same life form. The creature, if it is
such, has its first small glimmerings of intellect, a smell vision of that which
for such a long period has misted its perception of the trial it set itself, a
trial set, it seems, so long ago.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Now if that sounds like a cross between pure David Attenborough (try re-reading
it with a David Attenborough tone of voice) and some of the more recent,
wordy, science fantasy, then you&rsquo;d be wrong; it&rsquo;s pure me, only I can&rsquo;t keep
writing junk like that for long. Not that I think David Attenborough is junk, I
have a high regard for the man, but some of the books I&rsquo;ve got from the library
recently in the guise of science fiction are so indirect and waffly that I
despair of reading more than the first chapter. Either recent science fiction
has changed or my tastes have changed; come on Asimov, let&rsquo;s have the fifth part
of the Foundation story.

<h3>
IBM Attack
</h3>
<p>
Anyway, I feel a bit like the first paragraph. About nine months ago my
passing acquaintance with IBM type machines burgeoned (note I don&rsquo;t say
blossomed) into a full blown, in depth attack. That, viewed in the light of the
letters column of the last <a href="../text/#article1"></a>issue, where many writers confessed to more then
passing acquaintance (and in some cases actual ownership) of machines of the IBM
ilk; coupled with the fact that I have nothing exciting or even passing clever
to say about Z80 based machines at the moment; leads me sit down and write what
will no doubt turn out to be a somewhat scathing, but hopefully informative chat
about that recent phenomenon, IBMiss.
</p>
<p>
Slowly I&rsquo;ve started to see the wood for the trees, the complete and utter
ignorance brought on by total lack of information, coupled with the frustration
in trying to discover that information, has slowly abated me things have
gradually fallen into place. Not everything, whole great areas of ignorance
remain, but slowly it&rsquo;s getting itself together. We&rsquo;ve been spoiled, you know,
from the earliest days of Nascom and a tradition carried on by Gemini,
information has been available if you knew where to look, and failing that the
manufacturer could point you in the direction of a dealer who would be willing
to spend the time to explain, usually without charging. Not so in this
mysterious nether world of IBMism. Never have I encountered such a blank wall
of unhelpfulness, assumed superiority, misleading and incorrect information; in
short know-nothing salesmen.

<h3>
Twaddle Departments
</h3>
<p>
If you don&rsquo;t believe me, for the almost certainly worst examples and the
easiest to find, go to your nearest D*x*ns (preferably a big one) and hang
around the computer department for half an hour. Just listen to the twaddle
trotted out by your over eager computer salesman. At least D*x*ns has no
pretensions, nor is it renowned for the quality of its sales staff. You might
think you&rsquo;d be better off consulting your specialist computer dealer.
</p>
<p>
These (presumably highly paid) people might know something about business
software, and are ever so keen to sell you a system to solve a problem (with
what degree of competence I am unable to judge), but when it comes to pure
hardware technicalities, simple things (once you know the answers) like what
does EGA stand for (Enhanced Graphics Adapter), or what is the line timebase
frequency of an EGA card in EGA mode (21.45KHz), then you hit a total blank.
They seem totally incapable of comprehending that someone might actually be
interested in the machine for the machine&rsquo;s sake; their total lack of knowledge,
apart from a few technical sounding buzz phrases is almost unbelievable.
