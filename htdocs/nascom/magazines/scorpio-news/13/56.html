anyway, I &pound;1 ph. About nine months ago ny
passing scquaintance with IBM type machines burgeoned (note I don&rsquo;t eay
Blossomed) into a full blown, in depth attack. That, viewed in the Light of the
letters column of the layr issue, where many writers confessed to more U
pasving acquaintance (and in some cases actual ownerstip) of machines of the IBM

to say about 260 based machines at the moment; leads me ait down end write what
will no doubt turn out to be @ somewhat scathing, but hopefully informative chat

Slowly I&rsquo;ve started co see the wood for the trees, the complete and utter

graduelly fallen into place. Not everything, whole great areas of ignorance
Femain, but slowly its geteing it oiled, you know,
from the earliest days of Nascom and a tradition carried on by Gemini,
information has been available if you kaew where to look, and failing that eh
manufacturer could point you in the direction of a dealer who would be willl

hystericug nether world of IBMion, Never have T encountered such a blank wall
of unhelpfulness, aseumed superiority, @lelending and incorrect information; ia
Short knew-nothing salesmen.
