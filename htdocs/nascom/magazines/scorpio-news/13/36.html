If the jump instructions are present, the system size is checked to determine
whether warm boot should be off ROM (standard system) or disk (non-standard
system). In each case a small piece of code, to turn off the ROM board and jump
to the correct entry point, is copied to an area of free RAM (0020h) and
executed.

<p>
The soft switch can be used with any CPU card that has jump-on-reset hardware
(e.g. Nascom&nbsp;2) and a GM803 or GM853 EPROM card. The EPROM card must be
configured to be paged in after a reset.
</p>
<p>
Individual users may wish to add other features to the soft switching mechanism,
such as forced jumps to, say, BASIC or Naspen. This could be implemented in a
similar fashion to that on the BBC Microcomputer. That is, check for any
pressed keys and force jump accordingly, i.e. pressing &lsquo;B&rsquo; at reset time will
force BASIC to be loaded and executed.
