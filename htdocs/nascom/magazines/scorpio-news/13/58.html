10M Compatibility Problems
</p>
<p>
The problem with ISM compatibility all stems from the fact that IBM from
the outset allowed direct memory addressing to the screen RAN and the use of
Girect BIOS calls. This, of course, completely blows the dea that all I/O
should be done through the DOS and therefore be
