the newer processors all contain the 8086 instruction set as a sub-set of their
own instructions, and the new instructions are primarily (but not solely)
concerned with extended (over 1&nbsp;Mbyte) addressing modes. The book falls down on
the subject of the segment registers and how these are programmed (I still
occasionally have trouble with these as the numbers which magically turn up is
the registers tend to have no relation to numbers I told them, or expected them
to contain). I&rsquo;ve mostly got this sorted out with the aid of the examples in
the Microsoft MASH (Assembler) Manuals and the Morten book, but they still catch
me by surprise every now and then. When I&rsquo;ve got this aspect fully sorted, then
maybe I&rsquo;ll revamp the &lsquo;Dodo&rsquo;s Guide to Z80 Assembler&rsquo;, you know, the thing I
wrote all those years back, turn it into the &lsquo;Dodo&rsquo;s Guide to 8086 Assembler&rsquo;,
and see if this mag. will republish it.

IBM Compatibility Problems
</h3>
<p>
The problem with IBM compatibility all stems from the fact that IBM from
the outset allowed direct memory addressing to the screen RAM and the use of
direct BIOS calls. This, of course, completely blows the idea that all I/O
should be done through the DOS and therefore be machine independent, as it
firmly fixes the hardware to a certain form. I&rsquo;m quite sure this was not
Microsoft&rsquo;s intention, and seems a step backwards.
</p>
<p>
Many of us are aware on the incompatibilities which come about by trying to
transport CP/M software from machine Brand X, where the software rules have been
broken and direct screen and BIOS addressing has been allowed, to machine Brand
Y, where the I/O and BIOS are at different addresses. One of the sneakier
tricks of a certain piece of early software, which was written for the IBM
alone, was to make it look at the bog inning of the BIOS, where the message &lsquo;IBM
CORP. (C) 1981&rsquo; is held. If the software didn&rsquo;t find the message, it wouldn&rsquo;t
go. One entrepreneurial type soon got round that one in his clone by including
the message &lsquo;NOT IBM CORP. (C) 1981&rsquo; in his BIOS starting four bytes to the
left. After that, attempts to make software machine exclusive seem to have
ceased. The new Microsoft operating system, OS2 has the same publicly declared
intention that a11 I/O will take place through the DOS itself, and Microsoft say
that they have made it next to impossible to use direct addressing effectively.
We shall see; and also wait to see how long it takes Big Blue to get round that
one.

Back to the Books
</h3>
<p>
So given that the DOS, the BIOS and the hardware are all much more closely
woven together than in a CP/M machine, what are the most useful references? MS-DOS,
the BIOS and hardware architecture related software points are very
adequately covered by Peter Norton in his book &ldquo;The Programmer&rsquo;s Guide to the
IBM PC&rdquo;. This book unashamedly covers IBM machines only, but points out that
most of what is said applies to a good clone. The book covers all versions of
DOS from version 2.0 (with passing reference to DOS 1) to version 3.2, the
differences, the enhancements and the bugs. IBM appear to have made fewer
B1OS&rsquo;s than Microsoft have made versions of MS-DOS, and the book covers the
different versions adequately. It also has thorough extensions related to the
greater facilities available within the XT and AT BIOS&rsquo;s. It also notes the
differences and implications of different hardware / DOS / BIOS permutations,
although these can get quite hairy. It can not and does not cover all possible
permutations, but suggests a &lsquo;try it and see&rsquo; approach to some of the weirder
perms. The information on the BIOS and DOS is adequate to allow you to spot
&lsquo;compatibility&rsquo; problems without resorting to the source listings in the IBM
Technical Manuals.
</p>
<p>
Another book, the title of which I forget, as I&rsquo;ve loaned my copy to
someone &ndash; something like &lsquo;Advanced MS-DOS&rsquo; by the Microsoft Press, cowers the
inner naughties of the various versions of DOS, including lumps of source code
and bug lists (very useful). This book is confined to MS-DOS and as such is not
IBM dependent.
