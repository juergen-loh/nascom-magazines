Editorial
</h2>
<p>
Well, here we are again, and on-time again. It amazes me just how quickly three
months goes by, and IT&rsquo;m glad that I&rsquo;m not responsible for a weekly journal!
</p>
<p>
Response to Dave Hunt&rsquo;s &ldquo;how about a small section of MS-DOS and IBM clones&rdquo; has
been very positive. 78% of responses said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 11% said &ldquo;OK, if you have
to&rdquo;, and 11% said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. On the basis of this alone there is absolutely no doubt
that we should include further articles on clones/MS-DOS in the future.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, statistically this information is totally invalid, as only 9
people responded. So, how about this as a percentage of total readership,
rounded to the nearest whole point? 1% said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and 99% didn&rsquo;t respond.
Hmmm, that makes it rather more difficult!
</p>
<p>
When you receive the next <a href="../text/"></a>issue of Scorpio News, you are going to be asked to
vote with your cheque books. By then it would be nice if we knew what proposed
future direction for the magazine is going to guarantee that the maximum number
of people resubscribe. So this time, do please cast your vote (very topical
this; as I write it&rsquo;s the General Election next week!). Let us know what you
want to see happen. Are you going to resubscribe? If not, why not? What
content do you want to see? Would you like the magazines more or lees
frequently? Would you like lower or higher subscription rates? Would you like
more or less pages per issue? This is a very democratic publication!
</p>
<h3>
Nascom &ndash; 10 Years On
</h3>
<p>
&lsquo;This November sees the 10th anniversary of the launch of Nascom&nbsp;1. I&rsquo;m sure
that some of you, as I do, see this as an ideal opportunity for a &lsquo;happening&rsquo;.
