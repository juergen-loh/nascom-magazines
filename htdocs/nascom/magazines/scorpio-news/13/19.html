Re. Shugart SA200s.
</h3>
<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Mr Smeester asks about Shugart SA200 drives in Issue 2 of Scorpio Mews. Richard
Beal says that he thinks they were 8&Prime;. I have an SA200. It is in fact a single
sided double density 5.25&Prime; drive.
</p>
<p>
I have always understood that it was the update of the originally very popular
SA400. Unfortunately Shugart took too long to bring it out and when it arrived
double sided double densities abounded.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, Rodney Hannis, Reading, Berks.

<h3>
IBM OK&nbsp;! ... and NasNet&nbsp;?
</h3>
<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
A few thoughts on the future of Scorpio News, as you ask in your Editorial. But
first of all, what a pleasure to receive an 80-BUS related magazine on time!
</p>
<p>
I teach computing at an independent school in Surrey; for my own purposes, I
still use my faithful Nascom-2, with both Nas-Dos and CP/M (I&rsquo;m using Spex to
write this). Our main computer lab has a network of Nascoms using Nas-Net, but
I an finding the lack of a structured BASIC, and the paucity of
languages/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>applications a handicap, so we have recently obtained an Amstrad
PC1512, partly for immediate use for demonstrations, and partly for the
possibility of changing over one day. We also have another lab-full of Amstrad
6128s, end various other computers used for Admin purposes.
</p>
<p>
Although I should like to see something in the magazine on Nascoms with Nas-Dos
and/or Nas-net, I recognise that they are a dying breed, so would not attract
any great reader interest. However, I should most certainly welcome the ides of
an IBM/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>clone/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>MS-DOS section. After the Nascom manuals, I find Amstrad very
uninformative (though at least they have now found somebody who can prepare a
sensible index: in this respect their PC1512 manual is an enormous improvement
on their PCW one). I should also be interested in Dave Hunt&rsquo;s suggestion of a
section on Modula-2, having just bought the Turbo version.
</p>
<p>
I certainly hope you continue into the next Volume. I should be very sorry not
to have magazine to carry on the INMC tradition.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully, B.M. Hawkes, Budleigh Salterton, Devon.

Yes to more OSs.

<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I think that Scorpio News should give space to articles on CP/M-86, MS-DOS and
PC-DOS and the hardware, as a lot of readers are now using these systems and
there is an acute lack of information about any of them. I myself bought en
Apricot Portable, but couldn&rsquo;t get on with it. This was mainly due to the awful
screen, but also I couldn&rsquo;t get on with COMMAND.COM and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything
with it! Now I have the Gemini GM888 board and CP/M-86 which I am slowly
pulling apart from CP/M-80 thanks to Digital Research providing CP/M-80 versions
of ASM86 and GENCMD.
</p>
<p>
May I wish Scorpio News many years of success.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, W.H. Turner, Mew Malden, Surrey.
