&ldquo;C Language&rdquo; by Friedman Wagner-Dobler, published by Pitman. &pound;3-95. Don&rsquo;t buy
this, I think it is awful. Look at pages&nbsp;25 and 26 in Boots, if you don&rsquo;t
believe me. [Ed. &ndash; can&rsquo;t I just wear sneakers?]

<p>
&ldquo;Practical C&rdquo; by Mark Harrison, published by Sigma Press. &pound;7-95. Much better,
especially as it uses <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> C in the examples; shame it had to be the Amstrad
version, but nobody is perfect. Don&rsquo;t be put off by the blurb telling you to
&ldquo;avoid C sickness&rdquo;.

<p>
&ldquo;Understanding C&rdquo; by Bruce H Hunter, published by Sybex. I seem to have peeled
the price tag off this. It was expensive, but is good.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The C Compendium&rdquo; by David Lawrence and Mark England, published by Sunshine.
&pound;12-95. This gives a lot of examples of routines, building up into a useful
library. I forgive the authors for saying Quicksort is &ldquo;probably&rdquo; the quickest
in-memory sort. I thought Knuth said it was definitely the quickest.
</p>
<p>
Enough name dropping. Having read all those, I thought I ought to be able to
program in C. I was right. The input and output the language uses are like
those in Unix, which is right and proper, and unpleasant to use as well. As
languages go, C is very concise, which is a good thing sometimes. It can be a
bad thing as well, and I found myself frequently baffled by code writte to
impress, when I looked at some more C programs recently. The problem is that
many programmers like to use slick tricks, which are difficult to read. Anyone
lumbered with the task of maintaining such a program will know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
Hisoft C follows the standards laid down by Kernighan and Ritchie, who
apparently are major deities in the Unix/C view of the universe. You can write
i++ or ++i instead of i = i+1, which is fairly comprehensive. And you may be
easily able to appreciate that there is a difference between comparatively
simple statement like i=(j++)+(k++) and i=(++j)+(++k). But sooner or later,
you will fail to understand what a bit of code does, and alter it disastrously.
(The first assignment increments j and k after it has set i to their sum, so i
is j+k, whereas the second assignment makes i hold j+k+2.)

The Language is certainly very powerful, but it does not protect the programmer
from making mistakes. Where Pascal will notice you are trying to access an
array element that does not exist, C will cheerfully amend the operating system
for you. The resulting crash is usually a real mess. Anything you write that
fulfills the rules of C syntax will compile&hellip;
</p>
<p>
Still, Hisoft were only following the rules there, and none of that is their
fault. The real catch, with this compiler, is that there are no &ldquo;reals&rdquo;. Now
this is a big disappointment, and not just because it means we are unable to run
that damnable benchmark program. Floats are an important part of much of
computer programming, and this compiler would have been a really great one if it
had had trhem. It hasn&rsquo;t, and that is my only genuine (nearly said &ldquo;real&rdquo;)
criticism of it. I hope that Hisoft are going to produce a further version, with
floats, and I would suggest that they do it soon, and include support for the
Belectra
<?php externalLink("HSA-88B"); ?>
as well. Otherwise, everyone is going to buy Mix-C, and I for
one won&rsquo;t blame them.

Hisoft Pascal 80
</h3>
<p>
Yes, another Hisoft language review. The latest version of Hisoft&rsquo;s Pascal is
now available for a very reasonable price. And if you already have an earlier
version, you don&rsquo;t have to pay out all over again: you just get an upgrade for
&pound;10 by sending them the old disk back. This way of doing business is the only
acceptable way, if one is going to bring out upgraded versions of things like
compilers. Unfortunately we will never be able to convince the hardware
manufacturers of the wisdom of taking their old machines back, and selling the
new ones for only a &pound;10 upgrade fee, What a pity!
</p>
<p>
What you get, whichever way you pay for Pascal 80, is a disk and a manual in a
ring binder. The front of the manual consists of lots of update pages, which it
is up to you to put in the right place, and remove the old ones. I managed it,
