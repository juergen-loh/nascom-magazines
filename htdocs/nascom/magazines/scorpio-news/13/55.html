<h3>
Colour Display
</h3>
<p>
Having used a monochrome Gemini system for many years, I felt that there would
be little of no benefit in having s colour display as far as most programs are
concerned. I have now changed my mind, I think! The reason for my hesitation
is that whilst I am very impressed by different portions of the display in
certain programs being in different colours, without seeing them in monochrome
too I can&rsquo;t definitely say that it is a major leap forward. I do, however, have
the definite impression that it may be. How&rsquo;s that for a definitive statement!
</p>
<p>
In Dave Hunt&rsquo;s bit, elsewhere in this issue, he goes on about selecting a
monitor with 0.26mm dot pitch. Well, according to the manual, my monitor has a
0.3lmm dot pitch, which doesn&rsquo;t seem much bigger to me. And yet, looking at
characters on his screen, end those on mine, mine are much chunkier. We didn&rsquo;t
get chance to plug his EGA into my monitor and vice versa, but I suspect that
different EGAs must have slightly different character sets, and that Dave&rsquo;s has
got narrower ones. Which is better for long term use I obviously don&rsquo;t know,
but it looks to me that this is possibly yet another parameter to taken into
account when choosing e system!
</p>
<p>
With Dave&rsquo;s EGA and monitor he got a demo program. This displays various
graphics screens. Running this on my system I noticed that on some of the
screens there was a short line of pixels in the wrong colour, and that each time
you ran the program it may appear in a slightly different place. This was not
the case with Dave&rsquo;s. I reported this too when I went beck to Elonex. They put
a replacement EGA in my system, but it was still the same. They had another
system there with a different EGA, and that didn&rsquo;t show the fault. As I have
not yet noticed this problem with any other software on my system, I just asked
that they acknowledge that they have seen it, and if I ever have any funnies
with anything else I&rsquo;ll be straight beck to see them. Meanwhile I have decided
to assume that the demo program was written very specifically for that specific
EGA, and there&rsquo;s some specific quirk that makes it do a slight funny on my
specific type of EGA!
</p>
<p>
Finally, the display on my monitor is not quite square to the tube. It isn&rsquo;t
much out, but when I mentioned it to Elonex they said it would need pulling
apart and the magnets, coils, etc adjusting. For the moment I think I&rsquo;ll live
with it as it is rather than risk what may happen once fiddling begins!

<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
<u>For</u> A very reasonably priced system, to a very good specification. Well
designed for easy maintenance. &ldquo;Known&rdquo; drive manufacturers (except 360K add-on
by Copal?). Fairly good looks. Appears to be very &ldquo;compatible&rdquo;. Good feel (in
my opinion) to keyboard. Very fast for the price.
</p>
<p>
<u>Against</u> Maybe I was unlucky. but apparent Quality Control let down on main
board, key-switch/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>reset switch assembly, missing screw, monitor alignment.
Possible potential problem with EGA. Still won&rsquo;t run at 10MHz, 0 wait states
for more than a few minutes.
</p>
<h3>
Conclusions
</h3>
<p>
I think you pay your money and take your choice. You will certainly find it
difficult to find the same specification for the same money (at the time of
writing, anyway). And, of course, if you can live without colour the price is
quite a bit less. Remember, however, that my machine did have to go back,
although this may well not be typical. If you don&rsquo;t live within easy reach of
London this could be a problem, as all sales are direct, and so you can&rsquo;t go to
a local dealer.
</p>
<p>
If you are cost conscious and interested in an AT, I do think that this has to
be on your list. and if you&rsquo;re not ins rush, keep reading Scorpio News to see
how I get on with it in the future.
