</p>
<p>
ed method of system initialization in the Cold Boot routines is to
vr buffers and segment areas, initialize the path, wheel byte, and startup
commands, print signon
</p>
<p>
che supplied utility LDR.COH to load the required on a floppy
sd system, there does not usually appear to be much alternative to this
method of booting due to space limitations on the aysten tracks of the diek, but
Ef one has aparevepece on the floppy system track, or # Winchester, there is 8
etter way.
</p>
<p>
If two tracks are
avallable.. after
lable &lsquo;for the BIOS
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;A track on a Winchester disk may be 8k &ndash; 6.5k byt:
Feserved for the system, thea about 16 &ndash; i7k of
subtracting BDOS, CCP and Cold Boot Loader,
snd 25 sequence! end buffers, and 3108 workepac that the 23
ons can be considered to be part of the system, and loaded with the
&lsquo;Cold boot. Since the buffers can be opeionaliy Load
tfacks as woll, already initialized to zeroes, or with eet
ate, the amount of cold boot initialization becomes minimal, with only the
Gefault path and wheel byte needing setting up, although these could be defined
somewhere in the Z3 memory aren and loaded with the system too. This Nas the
Earcher advantage chat no S105 modifications are needed, except in the sere
Edit routine Te then also becomes Unlecessary to use LORCOM, except to change
the default segmonte for spectal purposes.
</p>
<p>
If this approach ie used, but only some of the areas are loaded from disk (e.g.
where on sey &laquo;floppy there &lsquo;fe some spare room on the system track, but
not enough for ALL of 23), then initialisation of non-loaded 23 segment and
Duffer areas must be selective, to avoid erasing data that have just arrived in
RAH fro &lsquo;ke. Te then deco! &lsquo;idea to group the progran
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;above the BIOS wos sad to group buffers above

Whatever the system adopted, disk space for the aysten Ls not &laquo; proble
amount of RAM allocated to the system is a problem however, sinc

Of the BIOS or 23 eat into the #PA. My extensively customized BIOS, toi
yith workspaces, takes Up just under sk, and the 23 system uses 3k ceculting
ina total system size of idk, including CoP, &lsquo;and I am determined not to allow
Ae to get any bigger. Since Iam aleo always trying to add features to the
BIoS, Yan aleo looking for ways to economiee on space. One thing that T have
recently done is to utilize some 80 spare bytes in the TCAP part of the ENV
Seguent, to hold the system message and Clock string that are displayed on the
(normaily locked) top Line of the screen. This has released 80 bytes in the
BIOS ares for more code, but of course, means that that particular configuration
of the BYOS will only work correctly 1a # 23 environment
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The BIOS plus Workspace size 1c one of the important considerations, since this
ie considerably Larger than BIOS plus Cold boot routines. T have no problea in
expanding cold boot activities, and in providing extensive signon messages. The
Maount of workepace aren needed 14 determined by the hardware used, and 20,
</p>
<p>
Felatively constant for a given system. This means that the BIOS peraanent cod
is the part that needs to be kept in check. I have recently helped two friends
Anetal &pound;3 on systems based on Nascome, and the big problen was in the amount of
space required by the BI0S code for the Keyboard routines. With a Winchester
