During installation of Z3 on an a friend&rsquo;s Alphatronic PC, some very peculiar
errors arose. An oversight had resulted in the SYS.NDR segment not having been
loaded or initialized, and the locations in question were filled with random
rubbish. The data found there by the Z3 CCP was being interpreted as the NDR
segment, and select errors were prominent amongst the reported errors.
</p>
<p>
The installation notes suggest clearing (part of) each discreet segment or
buffer area in turn. This works well, but it requires rather more code, since
the code required is virtually repeated for each area to be preset. It is much
simpler and does not take much longer to clear all of the Z3 memory area.
Initialization of startup commands, paths etc, can then follow. This reduces
the total amount of code needed for cold boot patches, and could simplify
installation where BIOS source is not available.
</p>
<p>
The standard method of system initialisation in the Cold Boot routines is to
clear buffers and segment areas, initialize the path, wheel byte, and startup
commands, print signon messages and then boot the system. The startup command
uses the supplied utility LDR.COM to load the required segments. On a floppy
based system, there does not usually appear to be much alternative to this
method of booting due to space limitations on the system tracks of the disk, but
if one has spare space on the floppy system track, or a Winchester, there is a
better way.
</p>
<p>
A track on a Winchester disk may be 8k &ndash; 8.5k bytes long. If two tracks are
reserved for the system, then about 16 &ndash; 17k of space is available. After
subtracting BDOS, CCP and Cold Boot Loader, over 10k is available for the BIOS
end Z3 segments and buffers, and BIOS workspaces. This means that the Z3
extensions can be considered to be part of the system, and loaded with the
system at cold boot. Since the buffers can be optionally loaded from the system
tracks as well, already initialized to zeroes, or with set messages, commands,
etc, the amount of cold boot initialisation becomes minimal, with only the
default path and wheel byte needing setting up, although these could be defined
somewhere in the Z3 memory area and loaded with the system too. This has the
further advantage that no BIOS modifications are needed, except in the Screen
Edit routine. It then also becomes unnecessary to use LDR.COM, except to change
the default segments for special purposes.
</p>
<p>
If this approach is used, but only some of the areas are loaded from disk (e.g.
where on say a floppy system there is some spare room on the system track, but
not enough for ALL of Z3), then initialisation of non-loaded Z3 segment and
buffer areas must be selective, to avoid erasing data that have just arrived in
RAM from the system tracks. It then becomes a good idea to group the program
segments together just above the BIOS workspace, and to group buffers above
this.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the system adopted, disk space for the system is not a problem. The
amount of RAM allocated to the system is a problem however, since all extensions
of the BIOS or Z3 eat into the TPA. My extensively customised BIOS, together
with workspaces, takes up just under 5k, end the Z3 system uses 3.5k resulting
in a total system size of 14k, including CCP, and I am determined not to allow
it to get any bigger. Since I am also always trying to add features to the
BIOS, I am also looking for ways to economise on space. One thing that I have
recently done is to utilize some 80 spare bytes in the TCAP part of the ENV
segment, to hold the system message Clock string that are displayed on the
(normally locked) top line of the screen. This has released 80 bytes in the
BIOS area for more code, but of course, means that that particular configuration
of the BIOS will only work correctly in a Z3 environment.
</p>
<p>
The BIOS plus Workspace size is one of the important considerations, since this
is considerably larger then BIOS plus Cold boot routines. I have no problem in
expanding cold boot activities, and in providing extensive signon messages. The
amount of workspace area needed is determined by the hardware used, and so is
relatively constant for a given system. This means that the BIOS permanent code
is the part that needs to be kept in check. I have recently helped two friends
instal Z3 on systems based on Nascoms, and the big problem was in the amount of
space required by the BIOS code for the keyboard routines. With a Winchester
