Appendix A. Typical BIOS modifications

<p>
This part could be in the equates section of your BIOS source, {f you have it.
Te assumes 23 vegmence and buffers start at OFZ00 and occupy RAM to 0FFFFH
Address &lsquo;OF200H &lsquo;fo where the 23 area stazte in ay systex Yours could be
different The same applies to the other addr:

iNow To the Cold Boot area of your BIOS, neer the end.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The Warm Boot Jump must be found. The code below assumes your BIOS has the Cold
Boot routines in the BIOS workspace a they will be overlaid when the
ayeten te running. The Warm Boot rout: wuatiy located near the start of
the Bios: &ldquo;Examine the First two jumps in the jump table at the start of the
310s (normelly 17 Jump instructions) to get the Cold and Varm boot routine srart
Adare: Hote that the jump to WBo0Tl found near the end of the cold boot
foutines as shown below will probably not be to the start of the Warm boot
Foutines as found from the second jump table address, but rome tens of bytes
Into the Warm boot routine
