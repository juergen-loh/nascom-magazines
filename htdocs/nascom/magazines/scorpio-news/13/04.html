<p>
We are quite willing to help arrange something, and again would ask for opinion
on what that should be. The scope could range from half a dozen of us meeting
in a Pub in the London area for a couple of drinks and a chat, to a hundred
people at a week&rsquo;s conference in Jersey, with guest speakers such as Richard
Beal, Dave Hunt, Doctor Dark, etc, plus representatives from various past and
current 80-BUS suppliers! Of course, the cost of this might range from nothing
to, say, &pound;500 a head!
</p>
<p>
So, again, please drop us a line if you are interested. A quiet get together?
Equipment demonstrations (your own, or manufacturers&rsquo;)? Talks? An afternoon, a
night, a weekend? Chesham (where it all started), London, Scotland, Bahamas?
How much are you willing to spend? If there seems to be any pattern to what
people want (and please give some options/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>ranges), and if there is sufficient
interest, then we will propose something in the next <a href="../text/#article1"></a>issue. I guarantee that
there will be something happening, but it may just be John Marshall, Dave Hunt
and I having half a pint in a Pub in Harrow! LET US KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

What&rsquo;s New?
</h3>
<p>
New products continue to become available for 80-BUS based systems. Here are a
few details &ndash; contact a Gemini dealer if you want to know more.
</p>
<p>
Gemini have released the GM873 RAM-DISK board. Exceedingly similar in looks and
function to the
<?php externalLink("GM833","",""); ?>,
a 512&nbsp;Kbyte RAM-DISK board, the GM873 has a capacity of
2&nbsp;Mbyte. All Gemini CP/M BIOSs, from Version 3.2 onwards, will automatically
ses and use it as drive &ldquo;M&rdquo;. Price is &pound;595. (Add VAT to all prices here.)
</p>
<p>
PBM Memory Systems in Ireland have also launched a RAM-DISK board. This is
fully compatible with Gemini&rsquo;s GM833, also with a capacity of 512K, but the PBM
board is non-volatile. An on board battery gives two months date retention.
The board can be supplied with or without memory devices, and can support any
28/32 pin device, including EPROMs. With 512K, &pound;370. With 0K, &pound;270.
</p>
<p>
A new range of frames and frame based systems are now available from Gemini.
The frames are based on 19&Prime; 5U units and there are various optional power supply
enclosures, drive enclosures, etc. The systems are targeted at Development
markets, and are available in floppy or Winchester/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>floppy versions, with either
Z80/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CP/M&nbsp;2.2 or 8088/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>MS-DOS, host CPUs/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Operating Systems. Frame prices start
at &pound;72, system prices at &pound;1495. The systems are called &ldquo;Odin&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Gemini are now promoting the Costgold 8088 based CPU/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>256K RAM board, as used in
certain versions of the &ldquo;Odin&rdquo; systems above. This board can run the MS-DOS
Operating System, and price is &pound;350. Rumours too of an 80286 in September?
</p>
<p>
Gemini have also launched a new version of their disk transfer Multi-Format-BIOS
system. (M-F-B 2 remains available.) The new system is renamed DX-3 (for <u>D</u>ata
e<u>X</u>change. Physically the system varies in having all of its drives in a single
unit &ndash; 5.25&Prime; 96tpi, 5.25&Prime; 48tpi, 8&Prime;, 3.5&Prime; and 3&Prime; floppies are supplied as
standard, plus a Winchester. The system is now driven from a Wyes-50 terminal.
</p>
<p>
The DX-3 software is also extensively revised, and more comprehensive. Code
conversion and mass duplication facilities are now incorporated as standard, and
AMIE (All Media Interchange Environment &ndash; I think!). With AMIE, support is
relatively easily added for different Operating Systems, and various options
will become available over the next few months. Complete systems from &pound;7950.
