The test program (listing no, 1) e not an exhaustive test but it do
verify that the mapping works, In it all the forty eight 4k blocks from
addresses 10000H to SYFFFH are mapped into the 4k block starting at 1000H ang
the Block number ie written into the firet byte of the block. The process is
then ropeated mapping the blocks back and checking that the first byte ie still
what &lsquo;ahd been written. Te outpute &lsquo;Success&rsquo; or &ldquo;Failed&rdquo; depending on the
Fesult. I didn&rsquo;t have any problems so I haven&rsquo;t bothered to extend the program
to explore which blocks failed.

To make full use of it T changed SUBMIT and the CCP to use the BAM disk for
the *$E&para;5.5UB&rdquo; file. Then I reduced the disk size by 4k and reloaded the COP and

disk will never be big enough to use as a source disk.

For some time I considered the possibility of writing disk cache software
to use the memory nore efficiently, bie eventually opted to try a banked version
of CP/M Plus which already includes all the disk cache softvare. This meant
Chat I&rsquo;had to allocate sk blocks of memory to banks, a 4k block to common memory
and then write ay own bank switching routine (Listing no, 3).
