T had no intention to go ineide the unit until two things happened:
</p>
<p>
1) I decided to try out the ke it turned part way round, and then met
jome resistance, I assumed chat it wasn&rsquo;t mating up too precisely with the
tatch to lock the id on, and turned it a Little harder. The resistance
Glsappeared. I later discovered that the Reset button no longer functioned, put
</p>
<p>
242 together, and realised these thinge may well De nerociated with one another!
</p>
<p>
2) The Norton Utd1ity programs include one called SYSINFO, that gives you
various information about your system, Like how much memory it hus, plus the
Kerulte of a timing test. The timing cost ie tupposed to indicate the number of
times faster the system is than a standard TBH PC. I know various people
dispute the actual figures given, but Telco know that # 10MHz, 0 wait state
syaten should give ile GE approx. 11.5. My system said 10 3,&rsquo; regardless of
whether I software switched the wait states on or off. Referring to the manual
Lidlecovered that there is a link block ineid that can be set to
aelect either (i) always one wait state, or (4ll jctable zero or one

I must say that the whole thing seems to be very well built, with excellent
access to everything. To remove any of the expansion boards requires the
</p>
<p>
ae of just one screw per board. To remove # disk drive requires the
Felease of two screws per drive at the front, disconnecting the power and date
Cables, and then the drive just slides out to the front on Funners.
