The timings obtained were:&ndash;
</p>
<table class="z80-et-al-bench">
<tr><td>Z80</td><td>=</td><td>135</td><td>Secs at 4&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td>8080</td><td>=</td><td>100</td><td>Secs at 4.77&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>60</td><td>Secs at 6&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td>8086</td><td>=</td><td>46</td><td>Secs at 6&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td>80286</td><td>=</td><td>36</td><td>Secs at 6&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>26</td><td>Secs at 8&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>18</td><td>Secs at 12&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
These suggest that the effects of a boost in the clock rate are in proportion to
the speed boost, an 8088 is 13% more &lsquo;powerful&rsquo; than a Z80, an 8086 is 30% more
&lsquo;powerful&rsquo; than an 8088, and an 80286 is 77% more &lsquo;powerful&rsquo; than an 8086
(running 8086 code).
</p>
<p>
Using these figures, the DOS-Plus (8&nbsp;MHz 8086) and CP/M-86 (8088) results shown
in Vol&nbsp;1 <a href="../text/"></a>Issue&nbsp;2 page&nbsp;31 give GM888 clock speeds as follows:&ndash;
</p>
<table class="pascal-et-al-bench">
<tr><td>ProPortran</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>30 Secs x 8 (1&nbsp;MHz 8086) x 1.3 (1&nbsp;MHz 8088) / 54<br>
			(8088 result) = a clock speed of 5.78&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Basic86</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>73 * 8 * 1.3 / 130 = a clock speed of 5.84&nbsp;MHz</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The average of the above is 5.81&nbsp;MHz, very close to the claimed speed and
suggesting that the figures above are pretty accurate.
</p>
<p>
An area I am not sure of the effect of is adding a wait state. Systems I have
used which add a wait state when the faster clock speed is used seem to give
pretty well the expected results from the clock speed boost alone, suggesting
the addition of a wait state matters little. Is this correct?

Coming Out.

<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I have a terrible confession to make: I have purchased an IBM clone. After
nearly 10 years being faithful to the Z80 chip I have committed the unthinkable
and I am in the process of transferring my allegiance to the IBM standard from
faithful CP/M-80. I have owned an Apricot for business use for three years and
although it is an excellent machine it did not have the available open
architecture that 80-BUS had supported, or the range of public domain software
under CP/M-80. With the Apricot having &ldquo;come out&rdquo; I decided that it was time to
see what was available on the hardware and software front to tempt me.
</p>
<p>
IBM have done s good job in fixing a standard to which most people adhere
eventually. They have brought order to chaos in the past with standard disk
formats, and with the PC we have a rudimentary framework to actually use a
sophisticated program with graphics and windows that is unknown in the CP/M
environment. It gives a new meaning to the phrase &ldquo;user friendly&rdquo; with added
complexity for all programs and the perceived need to take a Ph.D. to drive the
latest commercial offerings.
