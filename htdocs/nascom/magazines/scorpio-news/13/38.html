Although the
<?php externalLink("Pluto","Pluto 1A"); ?>
boards (and some of the other Pluto products, as you will
see below) are 80-BUS compatible, many people choose to use them with other
computers. Consequently a case, with power supply, may be bought for Pluto 1A,
with various interface boards available for connecting to these other computers.

<h4>
<u>Pluto 2</u>
</h4>
<p>
Pluto 2 is Io&rsquo;s best seller. Still an 80-BUS compatible board, it has grown to
12&Prime; x 8&Prime; to contain all of the electronics. It retains the same 8088 processor
and RS232 interface as Pluto 1A, but includes 512K of memory (optionally 1M),
has hardware pan and zoom, 256 colours from a palette of 16.7 <span class="uppercase">Million</span> (!), and
optional real time frame grabber. This latter option is very impressive, as you
would believe that the colour camera was connected directly to the colour
monitor, not going into and out of Pluto&rsquo;s memory. Pricing is equally
impressive!

<u>Pluto 2 &ndash; 24 bit system</u>
</h4>
<p>
<u>Only</u> being able to display 256 colours at a time on the screen is a severe
limitation to many people. At that level it isn&rsquo;t possible to have very smooth
shading from one colour to another, and therefore subtle toning and other such
effects are just not possible. Io therefore sell a system based on three Pluto&nbsp;2
boards synchronised together. This means that any screen pixel can be any of
the 16.7 <span class="uppercase">Million</span> colours aveilable.

<h3>
<u>Pluto Megares</u>
</h3>
<p>
Pluto Megares is aimed at CAD applications. It is a 10&Prime;x8&Prime; 80-BUS board and is
available in two versions. The first uses a non-interlaced display to give
flicker-free output; the second provides much higher resolution than the other
80-BUS Plutos already covered. A
<?php externalLink("Mini Palette","palette"); ?>
is fitted to these boards, and they
also feature hardware pan and zoom and RS232 interface.

<u>Non 80-BUS</u>
</h3>
<p>
All of the boards mentioned so far are 80-BUS compatible, although they may all
be used with a wide range of other computers, as described under &ldquo;Pluto 1A&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Io also produced a Pluto 1 equivalent that fitted internally in the Sirius,
although I believe that this is no longer in production. On top of all this,
they also manufacture two ranges of Pluto boards for IBM PCs and compatibles.
