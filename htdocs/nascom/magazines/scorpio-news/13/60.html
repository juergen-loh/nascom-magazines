Af something has nicked it, if the

<p>
che keyboard interrupt vector to

<p>
jpldcation has changed it, SIDEKICK changes it back. Result, the

<p>
doesn&rsquo;t. Moral, if you&rsquo;ve acquired &laquo; piece of &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; OF
which doesn&rsquo;t seem to work, and SIDEKICK 1 resident, don&rsquo;t give upon it until
you&rsquo;ve turned SIDEKICK OFF and tried again.
</p>
<p>
A worse situation theo that is where two or more menory resident programs
are asked to covexist together, perhaps SIDEKICK and something else, say FRED.
Can you imagine the fight if they are both polling for keyboard interrupts
Problems of this sort can often be solved by the order in which the programs are
loaded. For instance, we already know that SIDEKICK picks up the original
keyboard incerrupt vector and replaces it with its own, having processed the
Keyboard interrupt it passes it on to the original vector. so if we Loaded
SIDEKICK Cire and then FRED, SIDEKICK would know that the keyboard vector had
been changed by FRED and so change it back. Hovever, if FRED vere loaded first,
ie would change the vector to suit iteelf, then SIDEKICK comes along eecond,
seen the new vector to FRED, picks that up as the output direction vector and
Eaplaces it wieh its own. All should work Ok, as SIDEKICK will seo any keypress
First, and if it&rsquo;s not for itself, it will then pass it on to FRED. Of court
all that presupposes chat PRED doesn&rsquo;t indulge in je tricks as SIDEKICK in
the first place

Mystery Time
</p>
<p>
Here&rsquo;s one for the people who like mysteries. The utility called KODE,
supplied with 005, is weed amongst other chings to get the spted of and to
Gizect output to, the serial I/O. When executed for the firet time, it Leaves
part of itself memory resident, Now the generel wey memory resident progrs
ate handled are that they are loaded into low memory and a pointer is set to the
top of the program pointing to the next. &lsquo;paragraph&rsquo; of memory usable
transient program ares, Wot that it concerns uy hete, but all programs for 8086
Ghul tre Kelocatable in &lsquo;pacagrapha&rsquo; (16 byte boundaries), Suffice to any, DOS
knows where ro starting loading the next program. All thie takes place with
MODE. &ldquo;One of my proprietary programs makes Uve of this relocatable bit
there are times when I &lsquo;che UAR iG
</p>
<p>
together to do the job properly
Of room available on top of the program to accommodate MODE, #0
no problem &ndash; of at Least T thought there wasn&rsquo;t!
</p>
<p>
woile, it was found that the applications prog:
{ndulged ins Lot of UART parameter
fevery tine MODE vas run, it didnre recogneze that it had been Tun
Before.&lsquo; fo loft she reraert (pact Sehing) Fence they fond parageap olstes
&lsquo;eda, and s0 slowly &pound;ilied the menory until che application Mecupped and
opped outs Ok? &ldquo;But How come MODE Kaew 1f it had elresdy been run from DOS ond
aidnvt Leave the residen part behind then? Well I dida&rsquo;t twig thee quite so
soon, ae 1 didn&rsquo;e initialize the serial I/O from the AUTOEREC-BAT, but I did
Fire up SIDEKICK in the AUTGEXEC. I checked with couple of other customers &pound;0
seo if this problem had occurred, 1t hadn&rsquo;t, the only apparent difference was
hae they infeialized the seria? I/O in the AUTOEKEC and weren&rsquo;t ueing. SIDEKICK.
Feewarned. that SIDEKICK did. naughty things, 1 turned {t off, &ldquo;but it 20
Siffecence, the menory still filled up So 4 Looked as 4f SIDERICK could be
eliminated.
</p>
<p>
Then I tried executing MODE before executing the program, and the probles
went away. In other words, I guess (but I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;sure) this is what it
happening by executing MODE first, eis left in the rock
bottom Lowest pert of RAM. The next ti it checks to see if
Et already exists, but it only checks at the lowest address&rsquo; in RAM. if it finds
itself, it doesn&rsquo;t bother to Leave the resident part behind, if it&rsquo;s not found,
then the resident part gets left. So now MODE gete executed in the AUTOBXEC,
Followed by SIDEKICK &ndash; end of problem &ndash; only I&rsquo;m not entirely happy about ay
explanation &ndash; they don&rsquo;t say anything about that in the manual, 4c seems right,
but does anyone know for sure?
