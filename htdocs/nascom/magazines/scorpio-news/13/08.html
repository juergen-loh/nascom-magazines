icroroft&rsquo;s NBASIC interpreter and an SVC, to allow a1
expensive graphic abiiiey fiom programe written in ( nk)
BASIC. Actually, it reminds me of something T once wrote to go with Nascom
BASIC, called Vortex, except that Vortex wae rather clumsy by comparivon.
Anyone still use Vortex?

&lsquo;The software automatically Links dteelf into MBASIC for you, and has the effect
Of adding a large umber of new conmands to the existing BASIC ones. Graphpac
fe able to set, reeet, invert or test any pixel on the screen; it is aleo able
to draw lines using either rectangular or polar coordinates. There are two
Fesolutions, 256 x 256 of 160 x 75 using block graphics. Ia
