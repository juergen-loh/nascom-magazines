procedure is excellent, even if it does make my old chaining method obsolete.
It has the added advantage over my offering that it works on any disk drive, not
just drive A. The speed at which programs stored on a MAP 80 ramdisk chain one
another is truly inspiring for all those who are intending to write large
systems of programs. Many people wonder when I will actually get round to
writing a large system of programs, but I say to them, patience. After all, the
OU keeps me rather busy at this time of year, and I have not yet finished my
Prestel program...

<p>
All the programs I have written with this compiler have done what they were
supposed to, except when the compiler didn&rsquo;t realise what I meant, and did what
I had said. That sort of machine intelligence is a few weeks away, at present.
I have had a slight difficulty with my version of CP/M not behaving properly
when the menu system is running, but it works with older CP/Ms, so it isn&rsquo;t the
Pascal causing the problem. I hope to sort this one out soon, and if there is
any useful advice to share, I will pass it on. The compiler gets my
recommendation. There are more expensive Pascals around, but I don&rsquo;t know of
any that can be definitely said to be better. Go on, somebody, tell me I&rsquo;m
wrong...

SVC Graphpac - alias GM575
</h3>
<p>
I have been generously supplied with a copy of Gem-Graphpac to try out on my
Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM832"); ?>
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
video board. It always surprises me how few software authors
want their products to be reviewed. I wrote to a supplier of
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
software,
suggesting that they might like me to write about their product, but they never
answered my letter. I can only assume that they don&rsquo;t like my style, or that
there may be something horribly wrong with their product and they don&rsquo;t want me
warning you.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, enough sidetracking and beck to the subject in hand. Graphpac works
with Microsoft&rsquo;s MBASIC interpreter and an SVC, to allow easy control of the
SVC&rsquo;s extensive graphic ability from programs written in (takes stiff drink)
BASIC. Actually, it reminds me of something I once wrote to go with Nascom
BASIC, called Vortex, except that Vortex was rather clumsy by comparison.
Anyone still use Vortex?
</p>
<p>
The software automatically links itself into MBASIC for you, and has the effect
of adding a large number of new commands to the existing BASIC ones. Graphpac
is able to set, reset, invert or test any pixel on the screen; it is also able
to draw lines using either rectangular or polar coordinates. There are two
resolutions, 256 x 256 or 160 x 75 using block graphics. In either case the top
left of the screen has coordinates 0,0. Circle and arc drawing are also
included, and can use either a Graphpac routine or the SVC&rsquo;s own faster
routines. Various routines for screen handling are included, such as SCROLL
followed by a number, which sets up the SVC so that only the specified number of
lines at the bottom of the screen will scroll.
</p>
<p>
Graphs, in the form of vertical bar charts, are specially provided for, using
either solid bars or half tone. Although the results are not as sophisticated
as graphs drawn on QLs (a good machine, even if it did have a plastic case),
they are a great deal better then no graph at all. The ones in the demo program
on the disk were quite effective, and the firm was obviously doing very well.
Odd, isn&rsquo;t it, the way these profit graphs always go uphill? Once you have
created a work of art on screen, you won&rsquo;t went to lose it forever, so the PSI
and GSI commands which put and get a screen image will come in handy. Given the
speed of the SVC, it comes as no surprise that these are quick. Another very
handy facility enables full use to be made of the large number of SVC commands
that are accessed by &lsquo;printing&rsquo; escape sequences.
</p>
<p>
Provided you have an SVC and MBASIC, Graphpac de more or lees an essential buy,
particularly as it is sensibly priced. I with Vortex had been as good!
