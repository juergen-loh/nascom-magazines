Public domain one this time, {s the file archiving suite by Phil
Kate, PKARC and PEXARC. It haw #1] the advantages of LU-and NULU with none of
the disadvantages. (A major feature is that it &lsquo;aqueezen&rsquo; the files as ft goes
Aa ie analyoes the files for squashing, it automatically makes a choice of one
Of four different &lsquo;squeeze&rsquo; algorithae &lsquo;to achieve the greatest packing density
Having re-aqueered a nuaber of CE/M text files which were previously squashed
with NSWEEP2 and then archived under NULU I found thet PKARC made very
Hgnieicane savings indeed. The only problem 4s that it ie command Line drivea

On the subject of my cataloguer, T wrote it because I couldn&rsquo;t find
anything balf decent mocking around in the public domain (I&rsquo;m not saying there
ion&rsquo;t one, simply that T haven&rsquo;t found one). I based the idea on a crose
between the best parte of the original Ward Christensen CAT program and the
Inter FATCAP.&rdquo; The original CAT idea is a Little too simplistic for use with &copy;
machine which can use subdirectories and archives, whilst I found FATCAT to

A nice thing about fully compiling 4BAsE is that once you&rsquo;ve paid for the
compiler (which I have, fully Legit. honest), there&rsquo;s ao &lsquo;kick-back&rsquo; to
Nantucket, who wrote it. Far better &lsquo;than ashton-Tate&rsquo;s peeudo compiler which is
not only incredibly slow, but they&rsquo;ll charge you &pound;65.00 for every copy Of dBRUN
which you would need 4f you sold the finished product.
