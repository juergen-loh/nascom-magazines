inetal digficule co pick out the important points, and
often, there are easier or better methods of cars thie te
particularly true in respect of the choice of softwai methods, In my
Spinion, the inetallation information provided Cold Boot
routines is rather too specific to the particular BIOS used by the author of 23,

<p>
fand made to appear very rigid in application. Those without auch experience in
Machine code and operating systems might find it difficuit to understand oF
Implement. Some tipe and alternative methods of installation are euggested in
thie article.
</p>
<p>
The installation of 23 falls into several operations.
</p>
<p>
Chooeing the conmands required in the 23 CCP and ECP. Choosing names for
the named directory. Deciding on the Default &ldquo;PATH&rdquo; and startup commands.
Choosing the segment and buffer memory mapping to be utilized.

<p>
Some of the above operations will be described 4n more detail under &lsquo;Methode",

et of the installation is to assemble the .ASM source files
heeded to create ZCPRS and the system eegnents. These files are written in 6080
Bhemonice, and use several macros to define 260 opcodes,
