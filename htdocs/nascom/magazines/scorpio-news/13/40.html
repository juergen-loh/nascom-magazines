text, display various error messages, show disk files available, etc, whilst the

monitor displays the picture being created. A digitizer tablet is used to
control the drawing process. Moving the pen so that the cursor goes off the
right hand edge of the display results in a menu appearing down the right hand
side of the colour display. Then, moving the pen up and down highlights the
various options, and pushing the pen down selects the chosen option. Various
menus can appear, depending on what you are doing.

<p>
This method of operation allows for fairly rapid working after only a short
familiarisation time.
</p>
<p>
A detailed review of this package could run to many pages, plus it is almost
impossible to describe in words what I saw, so I shall just outline some of the
options and possibilities.
</p>
<p>
This package was demonstrated to me on a Pluto 24 bit system with two screen
memory end full colour frame grab facilities. A colour photograph was put under
the camera and &ldquo;grabbed&rdquo;. By grabbing into one screen memory and working in the
other, a new picture can be built up using operator drawn graphics plus portions
taken of the &ldquo;grab&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
The Distort command is fascinating. Any area of a picture may be selected and
copied to any other area. However, the two areas selected may be of different
shapes, and the software will distort the original area to fit into the new one.
As an example of this, various portions of the grabbed image were
copied/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>distorted to form a three dimensional cube, with pictures on each of the
three visible faces.
</p>
<p>
Portions of a picture may be picked up and rotated. Circles, lines, boxes,
ellipses, etc may all be drawn. Brushes may be selected for free-hand painting,
where the brush may be of any colour and size. More fascinating, the brush may
actually be a portion of a picture.
</p>
<p>
Text facilities are comprehensive. Various fonts (type styles) may be selected
and positioned. If required they can have a drop shadow (i.e. the text is
repeated again just behind the original text and slightly offset, in any
direction, by any amount and in any selected colour, so that the original text
appears to be offset from the &ldquo;page&rdquo; with its shadow behind). Box text will
take any entered text and stretch/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>shrink it as necessary so that it exactly fits
a box that has been drawn on the screen.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing is extremely impressive. When a drawing is finished it can
obviously be saved to disk. From this it is then possible to have slides or
photographs produced, or even dump it to a printer. Io have a Mitsubishi colour
thermal printer that can produce A3 colour prints on paper or acetate, and
around the show-room they have framed examples of this.
</p>
<p>
The system demonstrated was obviously using all top of the range items and
options. Prices of all this technology follow, but starting prices can be much
lower, and of course all of the items I was demonstrated aren&rsquo;t essential.

<p>
Arctic Computers of Wetherby, a long established Gemini dealer, and now a main
Io Research one also, have realised that many people would like some or all of
these facilities, but do not necessarily have the throughput to warrant
purchasing them. They have therefore just completed setting up a bureau, with
full facilities for producing slides, videos, colour prints, etc, etc. People
