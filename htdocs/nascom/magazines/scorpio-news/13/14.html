This KORing together reduces the number of bits lost due to overflow (due to
adding as for CP/M 2.2) and therefore each checksum byte contains more
information about the directory record, For this reason, the likelihood of
Adentical checksums being returned for directory records on different disks is
reduced and hence the possibility of a disk change being missed is aleo reduced.
