So next I thought I&rsquo;d try using the ASSIGN command from DOS, guessing that
the BIOS always picks up the drive parameters from drive A from the ROM BIOS and
forces it to do the double speed bit if the drive is 80 track. I set up the
paremeters for drive E and then assign drive A to drive E. I got 80 steps
alright, but still 15 sectors/track. Disgusting!!
</p>
<p>
Then I took the 40 track drive out and shoved one of the 80 track Teac
drives out of my Gemini in the hole, all should work now &ndash; or so I thought. I
set up the parameters to set drive B to 80 track and told it go. Can you
imagine my amazement when the 80 track drive proceeded to double step, do 40
tracks, spend the next 40 steps banging away et the end stop and then have the
nerve to tell me the disk had 720K.
</p>
<p>
At that point I assume I had got the select links on the Teac mixed up, but
for the life of me I can&rsquo;t see what I had got wrong as it still worked as an 80
track drive when it found its way back into the Gemini. Seeing it was about
3.30 in the morning I left it, and haven&rsquo;t come beck to it yet. But then again,
someone cut there has probably achieved my aim of using the 1.2 Mbyte drive on
an AT as a different logical 80 track 720K drive, sitting there assuming that
everyone knowe the trick, so perhaps if they would like to drop me a line ......

<p>
Next Time
</p>
<p>
Well I guess that about wraps it up for this time round. Next time I&rsquo;ll
chat about the fairly painless conversion from dBASE II to dBASE III Plus, some
of the not so nice surprises it has in store, and how to go about compiling it
using Clipper, Quicksilver or Foxbase, none of which is entirely compatible with
each other.
