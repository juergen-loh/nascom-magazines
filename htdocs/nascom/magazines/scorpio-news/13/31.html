With direct booting of 23 there is no need to use LOR.COM to load any segments,
Dut a startup commend may be required. My startup command 16:

CSET:ECHO Type &^C for CP/M, of any other key for HELP;SAK;HELP ME

to the SVC, and then prints the text
jBeage via the HCP ECHO command. 23 then uses the SAK utility to walt for User
Input. If thie ie &lsquo;C, then CP/M Le entered. Any other key proceeds to the next
command in the buffer. This causes 23 to use ite HELP.COM utility, which in
