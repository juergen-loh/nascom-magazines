Since I have only just acquired my clone I have not collected the full range of
programs I will need. The public domain programs are of a high standard and
there is sure to be one which will suit my needs for the next few years.
</p>
<p>
For those wanting to explore the &lsquo;C&rsquo; environment there is MINIX, which whilst
not in the public domain, is a rewrite of the popular Unix with all the source
code being published in a book. Primarily it is designed as a teaching aid so
students can alter code and see the effects of so doing.
</p>
<p>
In short one is entering a rich world where one can do one&rsquo;s own thing. I feel
that your excellent journal should include this aspect of computing as well as
the Gemini environment. Indeed Gemini have joined the MSDOS world with their
adoption of the Costgold card for their range. All that is needed is to provide
an adaptor for 80-BUS to have the full range of colour cards on our traditional
systems. Scorpio News&rsquo; contribution could be to establish the database of a
selection of public domain software for its readers.
</p>
<p>
Finally many congratulations on your efforts in launching Scorpio Hews.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, John Stuckey, Spartacode Ltd., Bognor Regis, W. Sussex.

Dear Editor
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for an excellent second <a href="../text/"></a>issue of Scorpio News. There were many
items of interest and I feel obliged to put pen to paper end comment upon some
of them.
</p>
<p>
Dr Dark mentions that he would like to obtain a board which existed to run a
Nascom&nbsp;2 keyboard on a Gemini IVC/SVC. If such a board exists I too would be
most interested to obtain one.
</p>
<p>
He also talks about the ED80 editor from Hisoft. I have used this on occasion
and found it unable to read/write files to drive P:, this being the drive MAP&nbsp;80
assign for the RAM drive. A short investigation reveals that ED80 believes
drives end at O:. This can be remedied by altering with DDT etc, one byte:
</p>
<table class="indent2" style="width: 30%">
<tr><td>0C3FH is:</td><td>FEh, 10h</td></tr>
<tr><td>alter to:</td><td>FEh, 11h.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If your version does not have FE 10 at this location do not make the changes.
</p>
<p>
Dave Hunt enquires of us humble subscribers as to whether articles about the IBM
and clones would be of interest. I for one would welcome articles about MS-DOS,
the innards of MBIs, and 8088 assembler.
</p>
<p>
For the past month or so I have been in hot pursuit of R. Conns ZCPR system,
which C. Bowden writes about. More importantly for me is Richard Conn&rsquo;s SYSLIB.
Anyone programming with CP/M and assembler should obtain SYSLIB. It is a
collection of some 100+ (I haven&rsquo;t counted) subroutines, which do all the nasty
chores for us assembler proggers. I heartily recommend it!
</p>
<p>
The latest version of SYSLIB is 3.6, and is available from the CPMUG&rsquo;s Software
Library in volumes SIG/M&nbsp;261, 262, 263, which also contain ZCPR&nbsp;3.
Incidentally, the HELP program mentioned by C. Bowden for ZCPR&nbsp;3 will not work
under CP/M. However, R. Conns earlier HELP.COM version 2.4 on CPMUG volumes
SIG/M&nbsp;99 and 103 will with minor mods and re-assembly. I have converted HELP
2.4 for CP/M and converted the .ASM source to .MAC. It also uses SYSLIB. If
anyone would like a copy it will be donated back to the CPMUG.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for an interesting (and on-time) read.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, Ian Cullen, Ipswich, Suffolk.
