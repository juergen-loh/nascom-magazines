Dear Editor
</p>
<p>
thanks for an excellent second Leaue of Scorpio News. There were many
&lsquo;Of interest and I feel obliged to put pen to paper end comment upon some
of then,
</p>
<p>
Dr Dark mentions that he would like to obtain # board which existed to run a
Wascom 2 keybonre on @ Gemini IVC/SVC. Tf such board exists I too would be
most interested to obtain one,
</p>
<p>
He also talke about the ED80 editor from Hisoft. I have used this on occasion
and found ie unable to read/write files to drive P:, this being the drive MAP 80
fesign for the RAM drive. A short investigation reveals that EDBO believes
Geives end at 01. This ca be remedied by altering with DOT ete, one byte:
</p>
<p>
OcsrH is: FEh, 20h
alter to: FEB, 1h.
</p>
<p>
If your version does not have FE 10 at this location do not make the chang
bout he IBM

For the past month or so T have been in hot pursuit of R. Conns ZCPR systei
which c. Sowden writes about. &ldquo;More importantly for me is Richard Conn&rsquo;s SYSLIB,
Anyone progeamaing with CP/M and gsvembler should obtain SYSLIB. It is a
collection of some 00+ (I haven&rsquo;t counted) subroutines, which do all the nasty
chores for ue assembler proggers. I heartily recommend ie!
</p>
<p>
The Latest version of SYSLIB ts 3.6, and is available from the CPMUG&rsquo;s Software
Library in volumes SIG/M 261,262, 263, which aleo contain ZCPR 3.
Incidentally, &lsquo;the HELP program mentioned by C.&rsquo; Bowden for 2CPR 3 will not work
under CP/M.&rdquo; However, B. Co sion 2-4 on CPHUG volumes
STe/M 99 and 103, 17. T have converted HELP
2.4 for CP/M and converted the -ASM source to &ldquo;MAC. it also weer SYSLIB. If
anyone would ike a copy it will be donated back to the CPHUG.

<p>
Many thanks for an interesting (and on-time) rei
