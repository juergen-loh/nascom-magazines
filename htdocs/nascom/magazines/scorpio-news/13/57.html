Take, for specific instance, the selection of a suitable colour monitor for
my new toy. In every case (I visited five shops) I had to explain to the
salesman the difference between the dot pitch of the colour tube (an intrinsic
feature of the tube) and the number of pixels (computer generated output) that
the monitor was capable of displaying. In every case the assumption had been
made that because &lsquo;such and such&rsquo; graphics card was capable of generating 720
pixels per line, then there must be a matching 720 colour dots per line. Not
true of course, the more dots the better, in fact a usable minimum should be
better than two dot triads (a triad is one blue dot, one green dot and one red
dot) per pixel, but tube manufacturers don&rsquo;t measure dot pitch that way anyway.
They give the dot pitch as being. &lsquo;so many per millimetre&rsquo; or, more usually, &lsquo;so
many decimal fractions of a millimetre per dot&rsquo;. The finer the dot pitch, the
better: unfortunately, also the more expensive. I finally opted for a 12&Prime; tube
with ea dot pitch of 0.23mm. I think some of the salesmen thought I was slightly
dotty myself for being so insistent.

How it might seem I am maligning some very competent and knowledgeable
computer salesmen. Not a bit of it, it just seems to me that computer salesmen
are on the whole useless. Those few (I haven&rsquo;t found one yet) who are
knowledgeable and competent will know who they are (and likely share my low
regard for their compatriots), my advice to them is get out now, you&rsquo;re probably
more worthwhile somewhere else.

So having dismissed salesmen as a source of information, where to next.
Well a number of friends have recently defected towards IBMism, usually along
the clone route, but in the main they are as much in the dark as I am. A couple
of them have had the time to tinker and therefore have sussed certain bits of
interest to them, but for an overall knowledge, I haven&rsquo;t found anyone yet. (If
I did find the &lsquo;Fount of all Wisdom&rsquo;, I doubt that I would be able to afford the
considerable amount of time required to absorb the information, and for that
matter, I doubt that the &lsquo;Fount of all Wisdom&rsquo; would have the time for li&rsquo;ll ole
me.)

Books and Colleges
</h3>
<p>
That leaves the technical colleges and books. Well, I do the night school
teacher bit at Paddington college (not a computer subject) and I know they don&rsquo;t
do short courses (or long ones either) on &lsquo;The Innards of MS-DOS&rsquo;, &lsquo;8086 (et al)
Assembler Programming&rsquo; and &lsquo;IBM type Architecture&rsquo;, which is what I need. The
best they aspire to is to keep asking me if I&rsquo;d like to take an introductory
course on Z80 assembler, and I keep saying no! Slough Tech did send me a glossy
leaflet on just those sorts of subjects, but the very expensive quality of the
leaflet made me very cautious about the price before I enquired, and I found my
caution justified. The courses were obviously aimed at business and were priced
commensurately, quite up to the price of some of the private rip-off classes I
see advertised in the computer mags. Anyway, colleges are out, they either
don&rsquo;t do the courses, or if they do, the charge is OTT, at least on a private
interest basis.
</p>
<p>
Books, well books abound, ranging from good to Mickey Mouse. The choice is
almost too much. These sort of technical books are expensive, but not as much
as the college courses. They may be hard to get, except by mail order, or to
those within easy reach of the Modern Book Shop in Praed Street, Paddington, but
at least they are obtainable. I have acquired two or three which suffice for
the software side, and I have the IBM AT Technical Manual coming which might go
some way to answering some of the more obscure hardware permutation problems
I&rsquo;ve hit.
</p>
<p>
Of the books, &ldquo;Programming the 8086/8088&rdquo; assembler manual by Sybex suits
for the internal structure of the 8086 family of processors with a full
breakdown of what makes it tick, the instruction set and examples of little
programs. The book covers the 8088 and 8086, being very similar processors, it
doesn&rsquo;t cover the cleverer and newer processors, the 80186, 80286 and 80386, but
as the sort of things I&rsquo;m called upon to write have to cover the whole gamut of
IBM PC&rsquo;s, XT&rsquo;s, AT&rsquo;s and all the various breeds of clone, I have to write things
at the lowest level, so 8086 assembler suffices. For those who are not aware,
