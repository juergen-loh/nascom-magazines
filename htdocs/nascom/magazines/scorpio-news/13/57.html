&lsquo;That leaves the technical colleges and books. Well, I do the night school
teacher bit at Paddington college (not computer subject) and I know they don&rsquo;t
40 short courses (or Long ones either) on &ldquo;The Tanards of MS-DOS&rdquo;, "e0a6 (et al)
&lsquo;Ascembler Programming&rsquo; and &ldquo;IBM type Architecture&rsquo;, which ie what I need The
best they aepire to is to keep asking me if I&rsquo;d ike vo take an introductory
course on 260 assembler, and I keep saying nol Slough Tech did send me a glossy
Leaflet on just those sorts of subjects, but the very expensive quality of the
Leaflet made me very cautious about the price before 1 enquired, and I found my

almost too much. These sort &lsquo;of technic sxpensive, but not ag much
au the college courses- They may be hard to get, except by mail order, or to
those within easy reach of che Modern Rook Shop in Praed Street, Paddington, but
at least they are obtainable. T have acquired two or three which suffice for
the software &lsquo;and I have the IBM&nbsp;AT Technical Manual coming which might go
some way to answering some of the move obscure hardware permutation proble
