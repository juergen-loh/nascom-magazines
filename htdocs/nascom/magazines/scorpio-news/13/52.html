I noted that the 1.24 floppy drive was a Teac PDSSFC unit, and thet the
Sinchescer was e haif-heignt Seagate unit. No un-heard of Taiwanese rubbish
here! Further, the unit was all equipped to easily take a second Winchester,
the power cable sitting there waiting.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The main board on the base of the unit contains che 640K RAM (10 x 256K chips,
plus 18 x GOK &ndash; 187 Yes, parity RAM.), the 60286, socket for 80267, real tim
Clock/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>calendar and battery, keyboard support, and general logic. Like most
boards,&rdquo; the Gate&rsquo;s chip tee fa used &lsquo;to provide moat of the general purpose

Eable going vo the second Db23, mounted oa one of the rear expansion panels
Corceeponding to an unused expansion slot.

<p>
The Monitor
</p>
<p>
The monitor is #14&Prime; TVM one (although {t actually has a *copas* Label on
front). Tt is a dual-mode one, switching automatically between CGA and EGA
Bodes as required by the graphice board.&rdquo; On the fear ie the maine-in socket,
plus a cable going to a 9-way D-type for plugging into the ECA bosrd. There are
flee four pots, two &lsquo;Vertical size&rsquo; and two Horizontal Centre&rdquo;, for adjusting
the display in each of its mod
</p>
<p>
on the front is an on/off switch, power-on indicator, brightness control, and
colour balance control. There is sleo 4 three position Display Mode
</p>
<p>
biver a full-colour picture, &lsquo;ore green only. or amber oniy one, &lsquo;T
Eoneider this to be an awful lat of use, at At 18 eney to soft:
of your own colour choice anyway. Unlees anyone tlae knows of 8 g0c
Det some people can&rsquo;t work out where their colour has gone, or don&rsquo;t even know
they&rsquo;ve got it)

&lsquo;The Keyboard
</p>
<p>
The keyboard 4s *AT-style*, whatever that meang. It has three groups of keys.
On the Jefe are 10 function keys, then there i che main alpha-numeric and
control cluster, and on che right is the numeric pad, screen concrol cluster.
&lsquo;The main cluster ts slightly non-standard in that it has the four cursor keys
Fepeated ina straight line at the bottom right hand corner:
</p>
<p>
There are three LEDs to indicate Caps Lock, Mum Lock and Scroll Lock. A couple
ing-out plastic legs under che keyboard can be used to tilt it,
ray chat P find it Boat confortable.
</p>
<p>
Key action ie a la TBM, in that each key conteine a &lsquo;click
a bad keyboard at all.
</p>
<p>
The Manual,
</p>
<p>
An AS ring binder containing the documentation comes with the syste, As seems
fo be happening quite oftem vith both hardware and software these days, there is
JUsT too much manual for the Binder, making it avkward co use Unless Jou remove
&lsquo;one of the smaller sections.
