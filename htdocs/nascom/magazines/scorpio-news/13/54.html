A program suppiied with the system, SPEED, wae used to switch between these.
You can ala0 svirch clock speeds directly from the keyboard, but hot wait
states.&rdquo; The defeult power-on state 1c set vin SETUP, which stores your choice
into battery backed memory

In general T can aee of no reason why you should want to switch clock speeds,
and&reg;normally cave the ayatem ee lOHEs.&rdquo; However, few of the programe chat.
fave are gence, and thete are far too fast at cite, let alone at 101 Tt ie in
fact interescing to note that sone of the games don&rsquo;t seem to alter, even when
the clock peed.&rdquo; Presumably they are uring one of the progrannable
&lsquo;are o seandacd. part of the At spect? At far sn aware&rsquo; the only
Elbe you HAVE to change clock speed ie with aome clever foruatt tp
Progeans thet drive various chips ditectly, and have very specitic and critical
Efaing loops in the code. At 1 don&rsquo;t seam to have any of these progeans thit
doesn&rsquo;t worry me.

I tried a variety of software on the system, and it all ran without proble:
with the exception of BASIC! By trial and error I discovered that BASIC vas
Eine at ali speeds except 10MHz, 0 wait states. I started to wonder Lf BASIC
was one of these programs chat falls over at high speeds &ndash; 7 couldn&rsquo;t. understand
how St could be for 4 moment, but that wae how ft locked. What would happen was
thes BASIC program that would run fine at 10MMz, 1 wale state (from aow on
L0/t, &ldquo;etey, would give various syntax ercore at 10/0. T went with my system &pound;0
see bave Hint. These funny prograne ran at 10/0 on his system &ndash; aha, a hardware
fault on mine! 1 then said &ldquo;Look how they fall over on mine&rdquo;. They didn&rsquo;t!
Hamat &ldquo;Then several minutes later, at 10/0, they started to fall. A temperature
Aopendent fault, cemporarily cured by a cold spell in the car? OK, Let&rsquo;s leave
the system on for a bit longer. Lo and behold, the sane problem at&rsquo; 10/1.

Back to Elonex

I took the system back to Elonex, and they disappeared into a back room. When
they reappeaced chey said &lsquo;changed some chips &ndash; try that. I aid, Leaving 1 on
for some time with no problem. Then, running Norton, I noticed that dt was back
at 10/1 again &ndash; they&rsquo;d reset the Link! 1 queried this, and was cold that all
the initial systems that they had had had run ee 10/0 OK. But thea they had
started to get problens, so they were all now sold set to 1 wait state.
</p>
<p>
I pointed out that the advert sa/4 0 wait states, and was told &ldquo;yes it will run
with Owait states, but not at 10 Miz, We don&rsquo;t say it will do both at the same
Hime&rsquo;. &ldquo;For some reason I let this pass, but have subsequently decided that 1
aay raise this again. After all, the SETUP program allows 10/0 to be set as a
default, and the manual various references to it. In fact, T have
subsequently met someone else who has recently bought sn Eioner ayetem and he
has noticed a Norton of only 10-3, yet his SETUP, AS DELIVERED, shows it te

<p>
to 10/0. Obviously the system is upposed to be capable of ity bat T xp
you&rsquo;ll see Elonex&rsquo;s adverts &lsquo;changed in the near futui

At the time of veiting, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find another 10MME syst:
same price, in fact I&rsquo;m not avare of &lsquo;chat&rsquo;s within
T fuppote &lsquo;ie &lsquo;can be argued thet one shouldn&rsquo;t quibble about the 1
bit of posible performance. If you are looking for &copy; 91
