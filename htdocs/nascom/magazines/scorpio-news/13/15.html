ALV is similar to that for CP/M 2.2 in that the BDOS uses the allocation
vector to identify which data blocks have been ailocated co files and which are

To eliminate the need for disk retets on warm boot, Digital Research came
up with the double bic allocation vector, If, a0 before, a file is written to
Esk, the 9008 will keep track of which daca blocks &pound;c {a allocating by using
one of the two Bite in the allocation vector for each of those blocks. when &amp;
file de closed, the second set of bits for the affacted blocks are updated to
atch che first If, on the other hand, che {ile 1e not closed before &lsquo;returning
fo Gr/H the Firat see of bite can be feret to thelr original state because the
Second set provide record of which blocks remain free. Consequently, the disk

DIRBCB ie the address of the directory buffer control block on non-benked
CP/M 3 systems. On banked wyetema, DIRBCB points to the head of a list of
buffer control blocks (BCB&rdquo; fa-16 bit addreve which points
to the firee BCB in the list. rhe firer and subsequent BOB&rsquo;s contain &laquo; 16 bit
address field which points to the next BCD in the list while the lest BCB
Contains &laquo; zero value in this field. This type of List is, for obvious reasons,
Known as a Linked list. A comprehensive description of the cB format is given
later Go, all 1 shall say at thie point ie that each BCB contains the address of
a directory buffer which will be one physical sector in length (sound fanilier
