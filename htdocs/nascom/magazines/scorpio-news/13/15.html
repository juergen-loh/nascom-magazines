ALV is similar to that for CP/M&nbsp;2.2 in that the BDOS uses the allocation
vector to identify which data blocks have been allocated to files and which are
free for use. CP/M&rsquo;3, however, uses two bits in the allocation vector for each
block on the disk. The only exception to this is in a non-banked CP/M&nbsp;3
where the option is given to use single bit entries as with CP/M&nbsp;2.2.
Since there should be no non-banked CP/M&nbsp;39 sold commercially (the non-banked
version of CP/M&nbsp;3 is merely an aid in the generation of a banked system),
all users of CP/M&nbsp;3 can assume that their system uses double bit entries in the
allocation vector.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, a double bit allocation vector is going to occupy twice as much
memory as a single bit allocation vector so why then use two bits per entry?
Remember how STAT.COM calculates free disk space under CP/M&nbsp;2.2 and how it is
possible to fool it by forgetting to close a file. The only way to update the
allocation vector under CP/M&nbsp;2.2 is to hit ^C to reset the disk system and log
in the drives again. This of course takes time and CP/M&nbsp;3 boasts better disk
performance. Digital Research have gone to great lengths to avoid resetting the
disk system with each warm boot &ndash; particularly since CP/M&nbsp;3 has also spent time
buffering both directory and data blocks to reduce disk accesses still further.
Control C is still available under CP/M&nbsp;3, when running the CCP, to allow the
user to force a disk reset but, to improve performance, this should be done as
little as possible.
</p>
<p>
To eliminate the need for disk resets on warm boot, Digital Research came
up with the double bit allocation vector. If, as before, a file is written to
disk, the BDOS will keep track of which data blocks it is allocating by using
one of the two bit in the allocation vector for each of those blocks. When a
file is closed, the second set of bits for the affected blocks are updated to
match the first. If, on the other hand, the file is not closed before returning
to CP/M the first set of bits can be reset to their original state because the
second set provide a record of which blocks remain free. Consequently, the disk
free apace shown by SHOW.COM (CP/M&nbsp;3&rsquo;s equivalent to STAT.COM) is always correct
and the need for a disk access has been alleviated. Unlike CP/M.2.2, the size
of the allocation vector for CP/M&nbsp;3 is calculated as (DSM/4)+2. The &ldquo;2&rdquo; gives
us the clue that the double bit allocation vector is in fact configured as two
single bit allocation vectors joined end to end.

MF is referred to as the media flag. This byte is set to zero by the BDOS
when a drive is logged in. If the disk/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>computer hardware supports &ldquo;door open&rdquo;
interrupts, the BIOS can set this byte to 0FFH when a drive door is opened. If
this is the case, before the BDOS next performs a file operation on the affected
drive, it will check for a disk change and perform a login if necessary.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
NOTE. The Media Flag is used in conjunction with the variable @MEDIA contained
in the CP/M&nbsp;3 System Control Block and will normally only be implemented on
systems supporting &ldquo;door open&rdquo; interrupt.

DIRBCB is the address of the directory buffer control block on non-banked
CP/M&nbsp;3 systems. On banked systems, DIRBCB points to the head of a list of
buffer control blocks (BCB&rsquo;s). The list head is a 16 bit address which points
to the first BCB in the list. The first and subsequent BCB&rsquo;s contain a 16 bit
address field which points to the next BCB in the list while the last BCB
contains a zero value in this field. This type of list is, for obvious reasons,
known as a linked list. A comprehensive description of the BCB format is given
later so, all I shall say at this point is that each BCB contains the address of
a directory buffer which will be one physical sector in length (sound familiar
to CP/M&nbsp;2.2 users?). The maximum number of directory buffers required will be
(DRM+1}*32/Physical sector size. For the Gemini QDDS format, this figure will
be 8 per drive. Different drives may share directory buffers under CP/M&nbsp;3 and
consequently one or more drive XDPH&rsquo;e may refer to the same BCB list.
</p>
<p>
DTABCB is the address of the data buffer control block on non-banked CP/M&nbsp;3
systems or a list head on banked systems. THE BCB format is identical to that
for directory BCB&rsquo;s except that each BCB points to a data buffer which will
be one physical sector in length. CP/M&nbsp;3 usys the physical record buffers for
blocking and deblocking the physical sector into 128 byte CP/M records and
