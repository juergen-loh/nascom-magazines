jenory. To have not produced any of these products for a number of years now,
sLthough the A/D board is in fact still available &ndash; it 18 now produced by Gemini
je the OM@z4,.
</p>
<p>
Another of To&rsquo;s early products wae the Pluto 1 colour graphics board, and it is
the success of this and ite derivatives and descendents that have turned To into
fone of the major computer graphics companies in the UX.

A few weeks ago I went along to Io, who are based in Baenet, to have Look at
their current product range, and co be given demonstrataong of rome of these
items. What follows ie an overview of the events of that visit, with
descriptions and prices of many of their products, No apologies are made if it

jentione in Scorpio News and its predecessors, Io Research have probably been
the most successful of the companies producing 60-bUS compatible products, and
this article is intended to bring the teadership up to date on the company and

phics mood, I was &pound;irat shown # video produced by one of their
Productions. Tals ie a video company that does a lot of work
for Chantel 4, especially for the &lsquo;Diverse Reports&rdquo; program, It would be
Unreasonable to try and describe in words the contents of a graphics video, so
Tit juse say that it was very impressive, and even more so when T vas told that
At was produced a couple of years ago. To&rsquo;s hardware and software have both
moved on considerably ince then.
