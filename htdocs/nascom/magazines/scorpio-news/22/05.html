Sunday morning, after a rather tasty &ldquo;brunch&rdquo;, was &ldquo;set up your own equipment&rdquo;
time, with various attendees showing off their systems and software, and much
software swapping (own-written and Public Domain I was assured by all&nbsp;!). There
were some very impressive systems on view, and it was difficult to realise that they
were all based on the same board range.
</p>
<p>
Mid-afternoon the event officially ended, and people said their sad farewells and
disappeared into the distance to their homes and families. Many friendships had
been struck, and I am sure that many will maintain contact for a considerable time.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to all that attended, and to all that contributed, either in speech or
financially. It was a great week-end, and perhaps we&rsquo;ll all meet again in another ten
years, or even sooner if the demand is there&nbsp;!

<h2>
New material
</h2>
<p>
In the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue I made a request for more material for possible publication. Nearly
every issue we seem to be reliant on &ldquo;the faithful few&rdquo;. For this we are very grateful,
but they&rsquo;ve made their contribution time and time again. I therefore asked for new
authors, and the result of this should start to be seen in this issue. Any more&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
I have to make an apology (this seems to be becoming a habit &ndash; see last <a href="../text/"></a>issue) for
two articles that should be here but are not. These were supplied on Gemini 96tpi
format disks. Unfortunately the 96tpi drive in my Gemini system went faulty under
warranty. At the time of writing I have been without it for 5 weeks. Without it I
obviously can&rsquo;t read the disks, and thus can&rsquo;t include what promised to be very
interesting articles. Sorry.
</p>
<h2>
Printers
</h2>
<p>
The last <a href="../text/"></a>issue of Scorpio News was printed by a new print company. I&rsquo;m afraid that,
although produced quickly, the quality left a bit to be desired, being over-inked,
and with bad alignment from page to page. I hope that this issue is an improvement.
</p>
<h2>
Current Status
</h2>
<p>
And finally, a few notes on the current status of various new Gemini products. This
information is based on a Gemini Dealer Newsletter distributed in late December.
Io Research have now ceased production of the Pluto 1, so Gemini has taken this
over. The GM886, 80-BUS 80286 board, is in production. The GM880, 64180 board,
will be &ldquo;available in early March&rdquo;, but as far as I am aware it is still a way off. The
GM890, Z280 board, will be &ldquo;available in May&rdquo;. The GM891 MODEM, V21/V22
(but NOT V23), is in production. And the PC-compatible Transputer board,
mentioned above, is now &ldquo;only&rdquo; &pound;2995 (2MB), &pound;4295 (4MB).
