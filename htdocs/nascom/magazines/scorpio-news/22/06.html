<h2>
Supporting Scorpio News
</h2>
<p>
Dear Sir
</p>
<p>
When <b>Scorpio News</b> hadn&rsquo;t come by the third week of February, I began to suffer
withdrawal symptoms, and to think &ldquo;Paul must have made off with the
subscriptions&rdquo;. Then a tiny envelope postmarked &ldquo;Aylesbury&rdquo; arrived. They are
returning my cheque, I thought. Imagine my thoughts when I opened the envelope
and found it contained the new issue&nbsp;! But if we do not support the magazine, it will
get so small that it will only exist in our imagination, which I for one would consider
a great pity.
</p>
<p>
Despite the limitations of 64K, a Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>MAP/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom CP/M system is very
adequate for most home use. The hardware is first class in quality, there is still plenty
of hardware support (consider the new Z180, Z280 and 80286 cards for example),
and one can &ldquo;get at&rdquo; the software and hardware in a way that is much more difficult
with the newer PC compatibles.
</p>
<p>
With the &ldquo;swing&rdquo; to PCs and compatibles though, many of us probably have dealings
with both systems, and it is inevitable that the magazine has to give support in this
direction too. The recent very interesting articles on DRH on attaching various drive
formats to an AT-compatible is a typical example of the way that we can continue
to help each other. We should also remember that Gemini are now producing an
AT-compatible series of machines, as well as the 8088 and 80286 cards for the
80-BUS, to say nothing of their Challenger and Transputer machines.
</p>
<p>
Ever since my first machine, I found all of the various Nasbus/80-BUS magazines
invaluable as a source of learning and information. More recently I have felt able to
contribute some ideas of my own. As the Editor said in the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue, contributors
don&rsquo;t get paid (boo-hoo). My reasons for sending in stuff is that it may help someone
with a similar problem, and it helps to keep <b>Scorpio News</b> afloat.
</p>
<p>
There are two things that you, the readers can do to keep the magazine alive. The
first is to send in articles. The second is to publicise the magazine to friends and get
them to subscribe.
</p>
<p>
Yours, Clive Bowden, Nr. Truro, Cornwall.
