If &pound; &lt;&gt; $ then we are being done.
</h2>
<p>
Well, in spite of the Prime Monster&rsquo;s efforts, the Pound is not worth the same as the
Dollar. But when you compare prices of programs and hardware offered for sale
on both sides of the Atlantic, you will find that the number is the same, only the sign
in front changes. Modula 2 for the Amiga is $99 in the States, and &pound;99 here.
Somebody is doing very nicely for themselves out of this, with the most annoying
example being Metacomco, who are actually in Bristol&nbsp;! They sell their stuff more
cheaply to Americans than they will to us.
</p>
<p>
So what can we do to combat this phenomenon&nbsp;? Well, it is obvious, really. Import
things. I was initially quite worried about this, but the easiest way is to pay by credit
card. You just tell them the number, and that you want airmail, unless you do not
mind waiting six weeks. The catch is that you may end up paying Customs duty. So
far, I have only bought a book this way (Sp*c*tch*r, if you must know) which the
Customs kindly ignored. Perhaps no duty is payable on educational material&nbsp;?
However, I plan to obtain some Amiga software soon, and will let you know if this
leads to any problems.

One thing it is easy to forget is that a any hardware is is going: to expect entirely the
wrong sort of mains supply, and you will blow things up if you give them 240 volts
when they want 110. Less obvious is the fact that <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Modem</span>s from America don&rsquo;t
understand our phone dialling system unless you are on System X exchanges and
are able to use tone dialling. No doubt this is dealt with in the &ldquo;Hackers&rdquo; Handbook&rdquo;,
but I haven&rsquo;t got round to buying that yet.

<h2>
Oh gosh, not benchmarks again&nbsp;!
</h2>
<p>
Well, only briefly. I benchmarked: the Open University&rsquo;s VAX cluster the other day,
using the UCSD Pascal they have on there for one of my courses, and got a quite
accurate answer back in about 5 seconds. I have no way of knowing how many other
students were using the machine at the time, so it may be an ordinary time, or it may
be excellent. One catch I found was that the UCSD system has arctan, but does not
have tan. Just divide sin by cos, obviously, but why on earth did they leave it out in
the first place. Paddy Coker tells me that the Acorn Archimedes takes about two
seconds, which is very nice if you can afford that sort of thing and don&rsquo;t mind writing
everything yourself, using dear old BASIC...

Book &ndash; Algorithmics, The Spirit of Computing.
</h2>
<p>
This was written by David Harel, published by Addison Wesley, and found in a sale
at New Year, marked down from &pound;15 to &pound;1.50; and is an up-to date survey of
algorithmic methods. The author is clearly not a C fanatic, as he takes all his quotes
at the start of the chapters from the Old Testament rather than anything by Lewis
