that microfilm is difficult to tamper with. To date, as far as I&rsquo;m aware, no such test
test cases exist for documentation stored in an imaging system. However, the same
criteria apply. Images stored in an imaging system are equally if not even more
difficult to tamper with and would certainly would be accepted as the best&rsquo; available
evidence under similar circumstances.

The image is stored in the computer, which leads to the next stoge. Vast though the
capacity of an optical disk is, it&rsquo;s not going to hold many images if each takes up in
excess of 8 million dots. A typical 12&Prime; disk would only hold perhaps a couple of
thousand images at that rate. So something must be done to compress the data &mdash;
to make it smaller.

Nowif you tried the do-it-yourself scanner, above, using a newspaper picture, you
will have noticed that in any one line there are a lot of black dots and considerably
fewer white dots. Imagine, if you will, scanning a piece of paper with text on ity In
this instance, the situation would be reversed, with considerably nigte white than
black dots. Also, with typescript &lsquo;the, &lsquo;number of oak white trangitions and

There&rsquo; sanumber of compression algorithms, no one algorithen is perfect for all jobs
(otherwise there would be no argument about which was&rsquo;best), each algerithm is
best at one form of image or another. -The main difference is the degree of
compression achieved by different algorithms attempting to: compress the same
image.
