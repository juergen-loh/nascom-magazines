<h2>
An introduction for the uninitiate and the unwary.
</h2>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a lot of hype going around information, management circles, about Digital
Imaging Systems and about Optical Disks. So much so, that it&rsquo;s beginning to get me
annoyed&nbsp;!! It takes a lot to get me annoyed, but of late I have been party to receiving
so much specious, doubtful and down right incorrect information, that I feel in my
own way I should start to put the record straight.

<h2>
What this is about.
</h2>
<p>
This particular paper is about imaging systems and the technical side of it at that. I
find that it&rsquo;s on the technical side that potential users feel most ignorant, and at the
same time are at the mercy of equally ignorant sales people (not that this paper is
going to be heavily technical, just enough so&rsquo;s you know what people are talking
about, sales persons, and potential buyers alike). I don&rsquo;t propose to look at the
alternatives, only to warn you that imaging systems aren&rsquo;t God&rsquo;s answer to the filing
clerk and are designed to satisfy certain fairly rigid criteria. It most certainly does
not mean that imaging systems are the-all embracing answer to all your filing
problems. Just because it&rsquo;s the newest approach, does&rsquo;n necessary mean it&rsquo;s the
best answer to your particular problems. Just a thought &ndash; I wonder why salesmen
don&rsquo;t like me, could be because I say things like that.

A few technical purists who read this are going to be upset. If, as I suggest, I know
so much about it, why isn&rsquo;t this paper presented in a precise and formal way, without
the sweeping. generalisations, the screaming approximations and the simplified
explanations, and why isn&rsquo;t it written in a format English, instead of the appalling
informal style I&rsquo;ve chosen&nbsp;? Well, all I can say to you Sir, is that this isn&rsquo;t written for
you, you probably know it all already, having read those awful wordy boring reports
and papers I&rsquo;ve had to read to understand what it&rsquo;s about. This has been written for
those who wish to know generally what&rsquo;s going on, not the precise details. I know I
use generalisations, and approximations. It&rsquo;s fine in its place, for guys like you and
me who have to actually understand precisely what makes a thing tick, but it&rsquo;s still
boring reading. I&rsquo;ve written turgid technical stuff before, and believe me, I like
writing it even less than I like reading it written by others. So if you don&rsquo;t like my
writing style &ndash; tuf&nbsp;!
