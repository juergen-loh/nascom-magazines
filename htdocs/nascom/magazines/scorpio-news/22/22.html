A number of options are available for each of the commands. These include
suppressing checks when overwriting read-only files on a PC-DOS disk, and
directing the output from a command to a printer. The latter is useful because
control-P has no effect within the program, although it is still possible to get a
screen-dump with EDIT and control-D. The <i>COPY</i> command also insists on being
told the format (CP/M or PC-DOS) of the source disk as one of its options, even
though the program knows the format associated with each drive.

<p>
The program&rsquo;s major limitations are its inability to erase or rename a file, or to
overwrite a CP/M read-only file or disk (which generates that dreaded <i>BDOS Err
on A:</i> message&nbsp;!). Perhaps someone will release a version 4.0&nbsp;! However, it is easy
to use, so much so that it can be run without referring to the manual. Gemini owners
who also use IBM&nbsp;PCs will find this an invaluable aid to their productivity. I found
its main use to be transferring data files and source code for languages such as
TurboPascal, which are available for both CP/M and PC-DOS.

&ldquo;Real Programmers&rdquo;

Real programmers would rather use a bank of toggle switches and read a row of
LEDs than use such cumbersome devices as keyboards and CRTs to talk to
computers.
</p>
<p>
Real programmers don&rsquo;t write specs. &ndash; users should consider themselves lucky to
get any program at all and take what they get.
</p>
<p>
Real programmers don&rsquo;t comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should be
hard to understand.
</p>
<p>
Real programmers don&rsquo;t write applications programs; they program right down on
the bare metal. Application programming is for feebs who can&rsquo;t do system
programming.
</p>
<p>
Real programmers&rsquo; programs never work right the first time. But if you throw them
on the machine they can be patched into working in &ldquo;only a few&rdquo; 30-hour debugging
sessions.
