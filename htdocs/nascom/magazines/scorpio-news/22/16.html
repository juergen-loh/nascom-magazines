and was written by Joseph Weizenbaum is the most famous example of this sort of
thing. There was also a program by Kenneth Colby, called &ldquo;Parry&rdquo; which simulated
paranoid behaviour. Douglas Hofstadter quoted in &ldquo;Godel Escher Bach&rdquo; from a
&ldquo;conversation&rdquo; between two machines, one running each program, which went in
part as follows:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Parry</td><td><i>: I don&rsquo;t understand your motives.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Doctor</td><td><i>: Why don&rsquo;t you understand my motives&nbsp;?</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Parry</td><td><i>: Shouldn&rsquo;t I be&nbsp;?</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Doctor</td><td><i>: Why do you say that just now&nbsp;?</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Parry</td><td><i>: That&rsquo;s just the way it is.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Doctor</td><td><i>: Suppose that&rsquo;s just the way it were not.</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Parry</td><td><i>:So?</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Doctor</td><td><i>:I am not sure I understand you fully.</i></td></tr>
</table>

An enormous understatement at the end there. In fact, all the programs were doing
was scanning the input for recognised words and producing a reply to fit them, from
a selection of possible replies. A program to do just this sort of thing, called &ldquo;Eliza&rdquo;,
was printed in the ancient publication from the dawn of time, &ldquo;Nascom BASIC
Programs&rdquo;. It was very effective, but it never learned anything new.
</p>
<p>
Slightly more recently, I converted and improved the old &ldquo;Eliza&rdquo; program so that
the user could teach it new replies. That program was written in EBASIC, a language
that came with early copies of CP/M, and I once sold three copies of it. Our Editor
has suggested that a disk library might be a useful addition to the services he
provides, so I shall be sending him these ancient, creaking programs in the hope
that people will want them, either as examples of pitfalls to avoid, or a foundation
to build on. My version of the program makes the same &ldquo;I/me&rdquo; mistake as every
version I have ever seen, and (I love it when I get to say this one) I leave it as an
exercise for anyone who gets hold of the program to remove this long lived bug...

One application of these conversation imitating programs that I thought of a while
ago, while planning what facilities to include in the Prestel software I was going to
write, was a version of the program that would scan all the new frames appearing
on a Micronet Chatline, and if they started with the word &ldquo;Marvin&rdquo;, a reply would
be generated, and sent to the Prestel computer. Alas, this particular software project
has gone halfway to completion twice now, and the two halves are both first halves
and won&rsquo;t work together. I have, however, learned quite a lot. about how to plan
large programming projects&nbsp;! In the meantime, anyone who wants to amend their
Prestel software to carry out this strange idea can help themselves. When one
considers some of the conversations that actually appear on the Chatlines, it is
possible that this has already been done&nbsp;!
