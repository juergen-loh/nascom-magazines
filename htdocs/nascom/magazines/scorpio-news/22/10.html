<p>
A label directory entry has the first byte as 20H, rather than the normal 00H or user
number. The password is encrypted in the area normally occupied by the block
information as shown below.

<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-10-1.png"); ?>
<p>
The important part, however, is entry 13 above which is the encryption &ldquo;key&rdquo; used
to form the encrypted password stored in positions 16 to 23, In this case, the
password was 1111.

File Protection
</h2>
<p>
Password protection for a file has the user extent type 10H. An example is shown
below where the file FRED.COM has been protected in a the following way.
</p>
<p>
A&gt;SET FRED.COM [PASSWORD=FRED]
</p>
<p>
The main directory entry for FRED.COM is unaltered, but the CCP must scan the
rest of the directory to find if an entry has the extent 10H. An example is is shown
below:
</p>
