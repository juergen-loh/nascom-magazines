What does &lsquo;Digital&rsquo; mean&nbsp;?
</h2>
<p>
Now the whole thing is &lsquo;digital&rsquo; &ndash; is this another bit of hype from the promotions
boys, as &lsquo;digital&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem to mean digital these days, it means.a sortafiwox 08
association with computers, latest technology and of course, is good for you syhether
it&rsquo;s got anything to do with being digital or not. Like the word quartz, another piece
of &lsquo;word specialisation&rsquo; which the promo boys have foist upon us. Quartz is asilicate
mineral &ndash; a lump of rock, nothing more, nothing. less &ndash; it&rsquo;s certainly mot an
adjective to be used in place of the phrase &lsquo;precision timekeeping&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s x not how
the promotions guys would have it. .

<p>
No, digital imaging is nothing to do with promotions, it is truly digital and a brief
explanation of &lsquo;digital&rsquo; is necessary. Digital information consists of binary codes,
and binary codes are often referred to as a system of counting in &lsquo;0&rsquo;s and &lsquo;1&rsquo;s. This
is true but confusing, better to say binary codes can represent almiost anything if
applied properly and the business of &lsquo;0&rsquo;s and &lsquo;1&rsquo;s is better presented as the presence
or absence of something rather than anything to do with counting. Binary codes
imply something to do with computers &ndash; not true. Binary codes could be written
and manipulated using matchsticks. Line up a row of, &lsquo;say, twenty: &lsquo;thatchsticks ail
equally spaced apart. In this case we&rsquo;ll say the matchsticks represent &lsquo;1&rsquo;s. The row
of matchsticks represents a binary code. Now take: some&rsquo;of thi-iiatchsticks away,
may be just a couple perhaps all of them, perhaps none. The absence of a matchstick
will represent a &lsquo;0&rsquo;. The code you.are: deft with is&lsquo;another binary eode &ndash; totally
meaningless in this case as the original code didn&rsquo;t represent anything in particular
in the first place, but a binary code-none the less,:and you didn&rsquo;t need a computer
to manipulate it &ndash; to remove the matchsticks. Another couple of quick definitions
-- each individual &lsquo;0&rsquo; and &lsquo;1&rsquo; is known as a &lsquo;bit&rsquo; and a collection of. eight &lsquo;bits&rsquo; is
known as a &lsquo;byte&rsquo;

The computer handles digital information,: but a las 5 welll see Tater, &lsquo;there&rsquo; s digital
information and there&rsquo;s digital information:dmportant tovour case is the difference
between the handling of an image. in a. computer and the:way in which a computer
handles text. In our own minds there&rsquo; s-a clear. distinction. between text in the form
of written words on one hand and-on the-other hand, pictures; &lsquo;You read words &mdash;
you look at pictures. The process: is totally unconseieus;your mind says &ldquo;This is text,
read it&rdquo; or presented with a picture, your mind says &ldquo;This is.a picture, look at it&rdquo;. But
that&rsquo;s not to-say that a piece of paper covered with.words is not-a picture. Think
about that, stand back from any printed page and.the text takes on grey shapes, you
can&rsquo;t make out the words, but the shape of the blocks of text is quite distinct. Can
you see that a page of words could be a picture&nbsp;?-Is the converse true&nbsp;? A picture
consisting of words is not necessarily text. Leoking close up at a picture made up of &copy;
words and the words might read as gibberish. So we have established a simple rule:
a picture is a picture; text is a picture; but a picture is not necessarily text.
