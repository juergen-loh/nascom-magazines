things into true perspective: <i>&ldquo;The GM8200 has eight light-emitting diodes, each of
which light when the error line on its associated T800 becomes active&rdquo;.</i> Wow&nbsp;!

Nascom anniversary
</h2>
<p>
As regular readers will know, last November was the 10th Anniversary of the launch
of the Nascom&nbsp;1 micro-computer &ndash; one of the first micros available in the U.K.,
and the origin of the equipment that 99% of you are using. I asked for interested
people to write in and say how they would like to celebrate this, and then arranged
the get-together that we eventually had.
</p>
<p>
We all met at a conference hotel in Bath for the week-end (Bath being a reasonable
average distance from everyone&rsquo;s home). We persuaded various 80-BUS dealers
and manufacturers to subsidise the event, and in the end he cost to the attendees
was virtually nothing (beyond the cost of getting there, plus a drink or thirty&nbsp;!).
</p>
<p>
Friday evening was just a free for all in the bar, with everyone getting to know each
other, and all of us putting faces to names; <b>80-BUS News</b> and <b>Scorpio News</b>
contributors present included Dave Hunt, Richard Beal, me&nbsp;!, Doctor Dark (alias
Chris Blackmore), Clive Bowden, Rory O&rsquo;Farrell, etc., etc.; dealers included Brian
Wingfield from Arctic Computers, David Searle from Kenilworth; representatives
from the relevant manufacturers; and so on. Various little sub-groups formed and
some discussions went on into the early hours.
</p>
<p>
Saturday mid-morning was a more formal event. Yours truly did the chairing, and
we had presentations of various new (and not so new) 80-BUS/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nasbus compatible
products. Some of these were then made available to those present at very
respectable savings, and a number of people eagerly took advantage of this.
</p>
<p>
Saturday afternoon was &ldquo;free&rdquo;. Some people stayed around and chatted. Others had
their wives and girl-friends with them and went off for a look at the local sights and
(unfortunately and expensively for some&nbsp;!) shops.
</p>
<p>
After an extremely pleasant (and rather dopey making) meal, Saturday evening
consisted of a few brief, but very interesting talks, on a number of different topics
&ndash; the pros and cons of different programming languages, &ldquo;did you know&nbsp;?&rdquo;s about
various 80-BUS software,
<span class="small-caps">Bios</span>s
etc., some hardware tips and hints, etc. There was
then a question and answer section, and finally retirement to the bar and/or bed.
