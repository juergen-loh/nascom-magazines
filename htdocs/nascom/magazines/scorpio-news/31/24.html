and another great step. I tried out Codeview on a C program which called an
assembler subroutine. It was marvellous to be able to step through the program,
setting watch variables and breakpoints and seeing the source code, both C and
assembler, fly by on the screen.

Despite these advances I have happy memories of the old machines and when I
moved house I put together a fully expanded non-disk Nascom&nbsp;1 system and got it
working before packing it away. I hope one day to find a museum worthy to exhibit
it in full operation, with NAS-SYS, 8K BASIC, ZEAP, NAS-DIS and DEBUG all
in ROM, with a massive 64K of RAM. Good luck.

<p>
Here are details of extensive modifications that I have done to the MAP CP/M+
BIOS, and these are available from me with the kind permission of MAP-80. Ltd.
</p>
<ul>
<li>All <span class="uppercase">Setdef</span> parameters pre-definable on assembly,</li>
<li><span class="uppercase">Bit</span> or <span class="uppercase">Binary</span> drive selection. (<span class="uppercase">Binary</span> disables <span class="uppercase">Assignable</span> feature.)</li>
<li>All floppy drives may be set to default formats on assembly but are also
	re-assignable later by choice. (All except first logical floppy.)</li>
<li>Physical Winnies greater than 32Mb handled&nbsp;&ndash; up to 512Mb.</li>
<li>DSKSTRUC calculation speeded up&nbsp;&ndash; for those who rebuild regularly!</li>
<li>SASI controller types S1410 or S1420 selectable at assembly.</li>
<li>Countdown timeout added to Winnie initialisation while waiting for drive ready.</li>
<li>Winnie error reporting in form TYPE, CODE, LOGADDR &gt;X&lt; CYLNO, HEADNO, SECNO</li>
<li>&ldquo;Retry [Y/N/^C]&nbsp;?&rdquo; added to floppy and Winnie, with proper UNLOG function,</li>
<li>&lsquo;Wn&rsquo; number added to signon display.</li>
<li>&lsquo;Fn&rsquo; display corrected for n&gt;9.</li>
<li>Screen centralisation Macros and message generation tidied.</li>
<li>N2/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>VSOFT initial screen edit problem overcome.</li>
<li>WFORMAT modified for multiple passes and retries to evaluate Winnie performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also have a modification for the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 256K RAM","MAP 256K RAM"); ?> card to convert it to 1&nbsp;Mb
capacity. For further details of information required to upgrade your system, please
send a SAE to me.
