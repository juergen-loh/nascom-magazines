All Perversities
</h2>
<p>
Now we all know the Law of All Perversities will contrive to make the most obvious
obscure, take the instance of the Gemini with the faulty drive.
</p>
<p>
This was a GM903 (if I remember my Gemini model numbers correctly) a single
floppy drive and a 5Mbyte Winnie. It came in with a dodgy disk drive, one of the
Micropolis ones I think, they never were too reliable. Anyway, it&rsquo;s a job of a few
moments to replace the drive, and the Gemini was placed on the bench and the drive
swapped. Because the keyboard and monitor were on the other bench, and the
bench, as benches will, was cluttered up, having replaced the drive, the Gemini was
moved to the other bench to test it. No joy, it wouldn&rsquo;t boot from the floppy disk.
</p>
<p>
So back on the first bench, and the drive controller card was swapped. Back to the
bench with the monitor and keyboard, and it still wouldn&rsquo;t go. This process went on,
the CPU card, the video card, the power supply &ndash; until the only thing left to swap
was the case. Now cases don&rsquo;t usually affect the operation of the machine, so we
stopped to think &ndash; what had we missed&nbsp;? In the end we fired it up without the
keyboard and monitor on the work bench. It fired up beautifully &ndash; Oh heck&nbsp;! Well
I reckon you&rsquo;ve spotted it. EM radiation from the monitor was being picked up by
the disk drive, and all it would do was error all the time. Moral: put the lid on a
Gemini before you try to run it near the monitor&nbsp;!

Diminishing Returns of Work
</h2>
<p>
This exercise took two of us most of an afternoon, which neatly brings me to the next
Law. Dave&rsquo;s Law of Diminishing Returns of Work, which states quite simply that
the equivalent effort visible from a group of individuals is approximately equal to
the the square root of the number of individuals employed. This may be summed
up by the equation E = &radic; I, where E is the equivalent visible effort, and I is the
number of individuals. This of course gives the lie to the old school maths questions
such as, &lsquo;If it takes one man two hours to dig a hole 2 metres square and 1 metre
deep, how long does it take the two men to dig a hole twice the size&nbsp;?&rsquo;. In this case
the answer will be 2.828 hours and not as every school kid knows, 2 hours. Eat your
heart out Kenneth Baker, try stuffing that in your National Curriculum. Whilst on
about silly questions, &lsquo;How may software writers does it take to change a light
bulb&nbsp;?&rsquo;. Just to keep you guessing, the answer is at the end of the article.

Signetics WOM
</h2>
<p>
Some years ago, BN, that is Before Nascom, I was the recipient of a pile of Signetics
data sheets. When I riffled through them the first time, I saw nothing extraordinary
about any of them. But on closer examination, my eye was drawn to the Signetics
Write Only Memory chip. It looked odd, but the significance still didn&rsquo;t sink in. Then
