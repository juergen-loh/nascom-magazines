I would like to be kept informed of add-ons for 80-BUS and systems software,
particularly utilities and disk format conversion software. Is there an IBMCOPY
for the 3.5" 720/730K format; is there a GENSYS config for the IBM 96tpi formats?
Has anyone got documentation for the principle clone cards XT, AT and whatever
&ndash; what will the empty sockets do?

I trade among Times 100 companies for micro applications in Central London with
training in SSM, SSADM and James Martin methodologies; preferred applications
are with Clipper/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>dBase.

I am running a MAP-80 based system with hard disk and most size floppy drives &ndash;
and also a Nascom&nbsp;2. I&rsquo;m interested in surplus hardware recovery, disk format
translation and PD software.

<p>
Contact from similarly interested users or those with complementary software
knowledge welcome. There can&rsquo;t be many of us about so don&rsquo;t let distance put you
off.

<h2>
The End Of An Era.
</h2>
<p>
I do not know how many readers of this final issue of <i>Scorpio News</i> there will be.
Maybe some of you have, like me, been avid readers since Issue 1 of the INMC
newsletter. With this last copy of <i>Scorpio News</i> an era comes to an end &ndash; the era of
user support and information for what I feel was probably one of the best CP/M
systems available.
</p>
<p>
In the early days I knew absolutely nothing about computing, and I found the
newsletters invaluable in sorting out my Nascoms and later, Hybrids. I am afraid
that I used to pester many of the authors but they were always very helpful and polite!
Later I found that I had learnt enough to be able to contribute to the various
newsletters, and I occasionally got letters and &lsquo;phone calls myself. I hope that my
contributions helped a few people on the way. Some of the contacts made in this
way resulted in good friendships, some of which are still continuing.

<p>
I still have my (mainly) Gemini based system, which is used for a number of jobs,
but like most people, I have been tempted to stray to the MS-DOS scene, largely
