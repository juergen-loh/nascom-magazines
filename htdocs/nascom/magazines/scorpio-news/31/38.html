it dawned. What earthly use was a memory that you could write to but not read from.
So IT read on. It was quite an amusing spoof, and its uses included &lsquo;Post Mortem
Memory (Missile Systems)&rsquo; and a &lsquo;Terminal Bit Bucket&rsquo;. It even included various
performance graphs, including a plot of the &lsquo;number of pins remaining&rsquo; against the
&lsquo;number of socket insertions&rsquo;. When you&rsquo;ve repaired as many Nascoms as I have,
you realise that the guys who drew up that particular data sheet knew their stuff.
You&rsquo;d be surprised how many 36 legged Z80&rsquo;s there were at the time.

Great British Post Office

<p>
Murphy isn&rsquo;t the only one to have Laws to himself. As we all know, the Great British
Post Office is a Law unto itself. There was the occasion where a Nascom&nbsp;2 was
returned for repair by post. There was no trace of damage to the box, the packing
was entirely adequate and yet the pcb was neatly snapped in half. Now I don&rsquo;t know
if you&rsquo;ve ever tried to snap a piece of glass fibre printed circuit board the size of a
Nascom board, it ain&rsquo;t easy, or rather, it&rsquo;s damn near impossible (at least to do it
neatly). Now the Post Office had their own theories about what happened, and to
honest, so did I. None-the-less, if it wasn&rsquo;t an immutable working of one of the Great
Post Office Laws, it only shows the heights of frustration owning a Nascom could
endow.

Defeatist Advertising

<p>
Dave&rsquo;s Law of Defeatist Advertising goes to prove that no matter what you say in
the ads, someone or something will prove you wrong. A nice example of this
occurred just after disk head cleaning kits became fashionable (and expensive). Now
I&rsquo;ve always wondered about the efficacy of disk head cleaners. The structure of the
disks themselves leads to self cleaning and the design of the heads ensures that there
are no head gaps to get clogged. Still, this doesn&rsquo;t stop the entrepreneurial types
trying to flog us something we don&rsquo;t need.
</p>
<p>
Almost immediately after a flood of free sample of disk head cleaners, a Gemini
came in for service. Nothing particularly wrong with it, but the owners though it
needed as 10,000 mile service anyway. Who are we to refuse money. Well we opened
it up and found the whole works covered with about a 3mm thick layer of cement
dust. It was everywhere, and apart from disclosing interesting patterns, indicating
the air flow through the machine, it left us with the job of getting rid of it. Close
examination of the drives indicated they were in as mucky a state as the rest of it,
except the heads, they were pristine clean. So much for head cleaners. We found
out subsequently that the machine lived in a small shack in the bottom of a cement
works where it kept tally of the number of lorry loads of cement which came and
went.
