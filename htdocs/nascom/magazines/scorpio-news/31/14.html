It was small, black, rectangular and had sixteen legs, a bit like a large woodlouse I
thought. It was only when it moved, looked up at me and spoke, that it struck me as
being anything unusual.
</p>
<p>
<i>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m the RAM, mate!&rdquo;</i>, it said, quite well spoken I thought, although it didn&rsquo;t look
much like a sheep to me. I made some remark to that affect.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Dodo&rdquo;</i>, it muttered, did I catch a tone of sarcasm, as it continued proudly, <i>&ldquo;Strikes
me as I&rsquo;m cleverer than you. I&rsquo;ve got 16,000 brain cells. More than you by the sound of
it. Sheep indeed. I&rsquo;m the brains of this outfit.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

I tried to think when I&rsquo;d last had a conversation with a sixteen legged insect, and
took to inspecting it more closely. It was then I noticed the boots. 16 of them, black,
and each with laces and a neatly tied bow. Now what would it be doing with boots.
No insect I&rsquo;d ever come across had had boots!
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;To catch the BUS with, what else&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>, it muttered under its breath, <i>&ldquo;And before you
ask, yes, I can read thoughts.&rdquo;</i> There was an accusing stare from the thing, almost
daring me to think on.
</p>
<p>
This was daft. I&rsquo;m not in the habit of picking arguments with insects. <i>&ldquo;Do you have
a name&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>, I asked.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Of course, but we don&rsquo;t go by names, we&rsquo;ve all got numbers. I&rsquo;m <?php externalLink("4116","",""); ?>.&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</i>, I thought, <i>&ldquo;That should explain it.&rdquo;</i> 4116 rang bells somewhere. Hadn&rsquo;t I
trodden on one a few days before and found it embedded in my shoe.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t. That was 7432. Pity that, he was a bit dim, but useful all the same. We
won&rsquo;t be the same without him.&rdquo;</i>
