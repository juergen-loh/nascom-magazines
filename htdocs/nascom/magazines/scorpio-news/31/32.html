As with the 48 x 16 CP/M, control codes can be sent direct to the printer. In addition,
control codes can be sent direct to the screen.

<p>
Please note: Software such as Wordstar and Supercalc expect an 80x25 line display;
to fix them to work with a 48 x 16 screen would require patches both to them and to
MOVCPM.

Lotti2 is a remarkable electronic drawing board which is very simple to use. It&rsquo;s
given me what I&rsquo;ve always wanted &ndash; a drawing board in my own home which does
not require a huge chest of drawers in which to keep the drawings. (It doesn&rsquo;t require
a pongy print machine either.) Now I can plan the garden, draw the new outbuilding,
do PCB layouts (no auto routeing or track separation checking, but very welcome
nonetheless) and draw the mechanical engineering drawings which are my trade.
The whole thing is menu driven and software drivers are provided for a bit pad, 3
types of matrix printer and 5 types of plotter. It can be controlled using just the N2
keyboard. For me, it&rsquo;s the bargain of the decade. You need an
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
to use it and it needs 48K for the Nasdos 2 version and 64K for the CP/M version.

Lucas officially abandoned their computing business in September of last year.
However, they still retain the rights to all their hard/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>software. The last I heard was
that they were intending to transfer those rights together with the repair contracts
to another company. I shall be writing to them shortly, thanking them for what they
have done over the years and asking them to press on with the transferral of rights
so that software will again be available to the 10,000 plus of us out here. Ring me if
you want a progress report.
