of the catalogue its price had fallen by over &pound;100! SYS 19 was reassembled to include
the Winchester split into two drives of 10M each and run. As usual nothing
happened! A long read through the manual, combined with a study of the circuit
for the GM829 finally showed that the SEL line needed to be active for up to 250ms
before timing out, and RST needed a 25us pulse. Both these lines were being driven
for the duration of one Z80 output cycle only. The first attempt to correct this added
a latch which was set and then reset when RDY went active. However the code
involved was not compatible with SIMON or any Gemini BIOS so the latch was
replaced by a monostable (74LS123), triggered by SEL and reset by RDY. The
Winchester then worked, set up in SYS as a Rodime 20M drive, although with BIOS
3.7 the Command Descriptor Block needs to be found and the last of the six bytes
set to zero, otherwise an error code is produced.

The system also includes a GM833 512K RAM disk. This has been increased to 2M
bytes by adding a link between all pin is and a further multiplexer (74LS157) to
drive this line from A19 and A20. The 4164s have been replaced by 41256s.

A 3.5" disk drive, also from RS, has been added. Again, a quick read through the
paperwork suggested no problems,but on trying to format a disk the drive stepped
very erratically. Yet more research found that a 1.2ms delay was needed after a write
operation before side change or track access. The drive code was modified to look
for any track seek/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>step instruction and add this delay first. BIOS 3 already has a
suitable delay built in for other reasons.

Following Paul&rsquo;s comments on WordStar 4 and how much better it was (WS5 is now
out for PC&rsquo;s) than Version 3, I have now upgraded to this for use with the GM880
card. However many problems have come to light. Because CP/M has very limited
memory available, compared to MS-DOS the programme is much more limited and
during edit time does not know character widths for proportional spacing, This
makes is very wasteful of space on the page, as most lines could include more words
than they do. It also cannot correctly centre a proportional line, asit only adds spaces
at the start of the line as if for monospacing. I have now worked out a long-winded
routine to do this, making use of the printer&rsquo;s own centring ability, dot commands
and custom print functions, QWER. The printer in use is a Facit 9401 typewriter
with Centronics interface &lsquo;Compatible with Diablo 630&rsquo;. However, it has several
software bugs itself. It should be able to automatically justify between margins, but
each line is short by the same number of units as there are spaces in the line (a space
is ten units). In addition if set to auto back print it misses the last letter from every
word &ndash; not much use!
