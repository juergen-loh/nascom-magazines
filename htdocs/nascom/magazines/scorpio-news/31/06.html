Something I have been thinking about for a while is to put a newsletter &lsquo;on line&rsquo; once
my Nascom&nbsp;2 becomes redundant (this will be quite soon now since seeing in the
article about the new NE898 CPU card in the last <a href="../text/"></a>issue). The BBS approach has
the advantage that there would be no publishing costs / difficulties, however it may
need to be a team effort. This is all still some way off as far as I am concerned as
Herman is going through another BIOS re-write at the moment. This involves
putting most of the code into another memory page so that I can fit in all the fancy
bits without ending up with a silly size TPA (at the moment I&rsquo;m down to less than
40K).
</p>
<p>
My main interest is in hardware development and system software &ndash; although I&rsquo;ll
mess about with anything. By the way &ndash; is is my imagination or is there really no
games software for the Pluto???
</p>
<p>
Oh well, that&rsquo;s about it. Again, may I say I&rsquo;m sorry to see the newsletter disappear
and thanks for at least having a go. BYEEE.

<h2>
Farewell From Me Too
</h2>
<p>
I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that you will cease publication soon. I&rsquo;ve been reading Scorpio
News and its predecessors since the first <a href="../text/"></a>INMC News &ndash; always very informative and
worth the money.
</p>
<p>
My Nascom&nbsp;1 unfortunately &ldquo;died&rdquo; late last year and I&rsquo;ve not had the time to
resurrect it yet but I still enjoy tinkering with it, so any news is worthwhile!
</p>
<p>
I am pleased to submit my name and address for contacts, etc (although I have no
particular speciality). Best wishes.

<h2>
Another Newsletter?
</h2>
<p>
First may I thank you for your stalwart efforts on our behalf over the last 2 years and
before! Whilst <i>Scorpio News</i> might be tardy on occasion it has always been welcome.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, with your offer of one last <a href="../text/"></a>issue sufficient folk will show an interest for
the good work done in the past to bear fruit. As to messages, I am very interested
in continuing with my Nascom &ndash; slowly growing into a soft-of-Galaxy. Thus, I would
like to see something created to take the place of the News and would be happy to
act as a clearing house for any other like-minded folk.
