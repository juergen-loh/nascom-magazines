The Jonahs said that it would be too slow, but it had to be done, simply to prove that
it was possible. The similarities between the Z80 and 8088 chips were too tempting
to ignore, while the poor old machine had almost ceased to deserve any extended
use, except that it had within it virtually all of the computational support for my
Ph.D. in Ikonics. (For those who need to know, Ikonics is the multi-disciplinary
study of how we perceive imagery, and therefore the key to how such imagery can
be re-imposed upon the mind by the transmission or recording of two-channel
&lsquo;information&rsquo;.)

Having extended the machine to a single disk-drive CP/M machine, with the
addition of 1Mbyte of memory (I couldn&rsquo;t afford the other Mbyte at the time),
bandying words with my fellow readers led me to want the PC-conversion more than
1 wanted to retain NASCOM/GEMINI compatibility. Not being very good at
machine-code (or any other form of language, for that matter, except swearing), it
became necessary to carve large slices out of existing software, then tailor the
patches into a working whole.

All sixteen 64K-blocks were therefore reorganised into one block which was
devoted to the boot-up sequence, additional registers, 8088-like address
segmentation and a table of redirectional &lsquo;hooks&rsquo; to the essential functionality of
MS-DOS, with the other fifteen blocks emulating the remainder of the PC-XT&rsquo;s
standard layout, including even LIM/EMS emulation, just in case I should ever need
that other Mbyte. It wasn&rsquo;t a true MS-DOS, but a rather inglorious &lsquo;hammer and
nails&rsquo; solution, which remains far too inelegant to want to demonstrate to anyone &mdash;
but it works!

At a Norton rating of 0.9, it was rather slow compared to the subsequently acquired
AMSTRAD PC1640 SD/ECD, as well as rather inconvenient, in possessing only
one disk-drive compared with the latter&rsquo;s 3.5" and 5.25" floppies, and a 21Mbyte
WD &lsquo;Filecard&rsquo;. In the end it didn&rsquo;t last but was pensioned off to a local software
house, as a disk-formatting and copying machine &ndash; a role which may take it several
years into the future.
