If no-one has any objection to the creation of a &lsquo;Roneoed&rsquo; or Xeroxed news-sheet
produced at minimum cost as is done by a number of Amateur Radio groups, I
would be prepared to make up and circulate a first issue to those interested in
keeping the ball rolling.
</p>
<p>
If successful such a &lsquo;publication&rsquo; should not cost much more than &pound;1 per issue &ndash; any
perhaps even less, though postage is a growing charge in this area. Ideas please to
me. And best wishes to Scorpio for the future.

<h2>
A Yorkshire Group
</h2>
<p>
In an attempt to keep some communications going, I am willing to extend our local
informal group, here in Yorkshire, to anybody.
</p>
<p>
What is needed is a zero cost, one-to-one response. The way to achieve this is for
any member to send me a disk with their contributions on (or empty disk) with return
postage, I will when return it with a compilation of contributions.
</p>
<p>
A carrot for you is that if the disk has your system files on it, I can return it with
ZCPR3 installed. Optionally, I will need a second disk for some of the support files.
</p>
<p>
Second carrot &ndash; do you have BIOS 3.# and fancy 1.4 Megs on an 8&Prime; disk that is as
fast as the old Rodime winnies? Sadly, I will do this in my &lsquo;spare&rsquo; time so return of
post is not on, but I will try. Sincerely &ndash; Cliff Brownbridge, Selby.

I&rsquo;m still active with the dear old Nascom (have 3 of them!), using NAS-DOS. I&rsquo;d
like to hear from any other radio amateurs still enjoying this fine machine. Thanks

Help!

<p>
I have the Henry&rsquo;s Radio Utilities and would like to use UNSPOOL. However, I do
not have the MAC assembler and wondered whether anyone could help out with a
modified version of the source to suit Microsoft MACRO-80 assembler? I just
cannot seem to find the time to sit down and sort it out myself as there always sseems
to be too many other more important tasks to be done.
