Why had I asked that&nbsp;? I knew, even before I asked, it would upset him, and now
I&rsquo;m alone. There was still the shuffling noises in the dark. A murmuring &ndash; but nothing
in sight, just the parallel tracks going off into the darkness.
</p>
<p>
This was no good at all. The best way to find out where I was was to explore, and
those parallel tracks looked interesting. I started to walk, taking care that I didn&rsquo;t
tread on any of the insects, although none were in sight. Still the shuffling noises in
the darkness, was I being followed. The tracks started to fan out, and there at the
edge of the gloom was row upon row of the insects. They stood fast as I approached.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;ve upset Z80.&rdquo;</i>, said a voice from the row.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Is that <?php externalLink("4116","",""); ?>&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>, I asked, desperately looking for a friend.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re 4116&rdquo;</i>, a chorus of voices replied, <i>&ldquo;Some of his brothers &ndash; but he told us
all about you. Do you deny treading on 7432&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Er &ndash; no, it was an accident&rdquo;</i>, I replied sheepishly.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;H-rrumph&rdquo;</i>, at least that&rsquo;s what it sounded like, in chorus. I felt I wasn&rsquo;t making a
good impression here.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;Do you always all speak together&nbsp;?&rdquo;</i> I asked, trying to change the subject.
</p>
<p>
<i>&ldquo;In groups of eight.&rdquo;</i> the chorus replied, <i>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t take kindly to people who tread on
our mates.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

There was a general movement, I saw the boots of the first row of insects, they all
seemed to have little knives in the toecaps, like the nasties in a James Bond film.
Who was James Bond&nbsp;? 16 boots a piece, and 8 of them. Then the second row moved,
each with boots and each boot with knives. And then the next row.... I thought of
running, but knew they could out run me. I suppose I could hope they&rsquo;d trip over
their legs and stab themselves to death but knew they wouldn&rsquo;t. I felt this was the
end. I waited for the rush. I guess I could deal with a few of them, but not all at once.
You do silly things when faced with trouble. I tried to calculate 8 rows of insects,
each row with 8 insects, and each row with 16 boots. It looked like death by a
thousand cuts, well 1024 cuts anyway &ndash; close enough. And then it happened. A
blinding flash 1024 &ndash; 2<sup>10</sup> &ndash; a binary number. I knew where I was. And they flew at
me. They aimed for the face. Hundreds of little pin pricks &ndash; none fatal, but each
hurt.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m awake now. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever fallen asleep whilst assembling a printed
circuit board before. I must have nodded off and ended up face down on the solder
side of the board. All those little legs. My face looks like it&rsquo;s just lost an argument
with the blunt end of a hedgehog. There I go again &ndash; feet. Why feet&nbsp;? Can anyone
tell me what happened&nbsp;?
