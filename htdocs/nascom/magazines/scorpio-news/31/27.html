(these were 16K x 1!) created as a result of soaring demand from companies such
as Sinclair, Acorn, Apple, Commodore and ourselves.

<p>
These sort of problems put a great strain on the cash resources of the company and
we were forced to find external funding. This finally materialised in the summer of
1979 in the form of a deal with Grovewood Securities who provided much needed
cash on a very attractive basis. Unfortunately we fell into the classic trap of not
asking for enough cash initially, and when we returned in January 1980 asking for
more we were refused.
</p>
<p>
I felt at the time that this was a bad decision on Grovewoods&rsquo; part and nothing that
has happened subsequently has made me change my mind. It was also untypical of
the far-sighted policies usually followed by John Danny, the Chairman of
Grovewood. It was only a matter of months before the inevitable occurred, during
which time I tried to drastically cut overheads in order to save the company. I also
became embroiled in a particularly bloody boardroom battle which resulted in the
dismissal of all of the directors of the company. Every avenue of refinance was
explored, but without success, and on 27 May I was forced to ask Grovewood to
appoint a Receiver, thus achieving the somewhat dubious claim of being the first
microcomputer company to seek protection from its creditors by this means.
</p>
<p>
Grovewood appointed Messrs Cork Gully to manage the company&rsquo;s affairs and,
much to their relief, I decided to quit within a month of the Receiver&rsquo;s arrival.
Nascom stayed in receivership for nearly 2 years, apparently trading at a profit
before being bought by Lucas and I have often considered that this fact alone
vindicated my request for more finance.
</p>
<p>
Any contractual restriction on my activities were terminated when Cork Gully took
over and I immediately established Gemini in Amersham, with a view to exploiting
the demand for peripherals for Nascom systems. I was forced to use my house as
collateral for a bank loan and was successful in persuading all but one of my old
suppliers at Nascom to give me credit at Gemini notwithstanding the losses they had
recently sustained.
</p>
<p>
We sub-contracted all of the design and manufacturing activities, paying only for
results. Within 18 months we were ready to launch our own CPU boards and
subsequently introduced the CP/M based Galaxy system at the &lsquo;Which&rsquo; Computer
Show in January 1982.
</p>
<p>
I watched the arrival of IBM with great trepidation and avoided chasing either the
clone or add-on markets because of the cash problems that I could see developing.
Gemini focused its activities on niche-type markets, thereby side-stepping any
confrontation with the larger companies who had arrived on the scene. We
produced our first 68000-based designs in 1985, whilst continuing to support our
