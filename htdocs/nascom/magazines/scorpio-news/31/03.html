<h2>
Bulletin Board
</h2>
<p>
Sorry to see the end of <i>Scorpio News</i>, but I can understand the reasons. I still
fantasise about an 80-BUS system with lots of RAM using paging, etc, to switch
between word-processing, database, etc, instantly... I wonder where we would be if
IBM had continued to ignore the micro??
</p>
<p>
For all those out there in reading land who have learnt a lot and been entertained
by Scorpio&rsquo;s (and other contributors&rsquo;) efforts, you may be interested to know that I
run a bulletin board called K-WOOD BBS on Great Tew (______) ___. It runs 24
hours and accepts calls at V21, V22, V22bis and V23. I have a (not very active) area
for 80-BUS and more CP/M files than most boards these days. so any reader with
a modem is more than welcome to call in and leave messages, ask for help, give
advice etc. There is also an area for Feline Fanciers as my wife and I breed Siamese
cats. <i>[Ed&rsquo;s wife &ndash; I&rsquo;m very interested in this info as I&rsquo;m an FF too!]</i>

Just looked at INMC Issue&nbsp;2 &ndash; we know what
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/02/01/text/#article1">Dave Hunt is up to</a>,
what happened
to the others on the original committee I wonder?? (What would MS-DOS have
been by now if Richard Beal had worked for MicroSoft?)

<h2>
Disk Drives?
</h2>
<p>
Does anyone know where I can get a working, (cheap) 5 1/2&Prime; DSQD half-height disk
drive? Thanks.

<h2>
Retiring To My Nascom
</h2>
<p>
I&rsquo;m shortly retiring from full-time work and will have more time to spend on my
dearly beloved NASCOM&nbsp;2. I would be interested to hear from any others in a
similar situation.

<p>
(Am also active with IBM, but don&rsquo;t talk about that!).
