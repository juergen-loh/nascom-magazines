due to the vast amount of software which is growing more sophisticated by the day.
The increased speed of the newer systems is also attractive.

Another interest of mine is Amateur Radio, but due to lack of time, I have not been
able to marry this to computing as much as I had hoped. Maybe I will be able to
rectify this in future.

I am sure that some readers are still very interested in the 80- BUS systems. If I can
be of any assistance with regard to any of the articles that I have written in the various
mags over the last 4 or 5 years, I would be pleased to help where possible. I would
particularly recommend anyone contemplating staying with CP/M to try to get the
ZCPR3 operating system running, as it really does make operating a pleasure.

Best wishes to all. Clive Bowden G30CB, Truro.

I&rsquo;d like to say how much I (and many others, I suspect) have enjoyed the various
versions of the NasBus/80-BUS magazines over the years &ndash; and how much I have
benefitted from many of the articles &ndash; as well as the many friends and contacts I have
made. I must own up to feelings of irritation when the magazines were late but on
more sober reflection, so are many other newsletters and magazines produced on
a part-time basis. Thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
ps: I&rsquo;d be glad to hear from 80-BUS users with PCs &ndash; to swap software and horror
stories. Best wishes.

Very sad to hear that you are discontinuing the rag. Believe it or not, there are people
out here who look forward to it flopping onto the doormat. By the way, what about
all the business about including the PC series in the mag? As far as contributions
and feedback is concerned you should know that &lsquo;80-BUS&rsquo; people have a long
history of almost militant apathy. I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s any chance of doing
something on a more informal basis (as and when it&rsquo;s worthwhile)? &hellip;No? Oh well,
it was worth a try.

I am sure there is still a lot of loyal support out there, no matter how quiet it is: I
know I am (loyal AND quiet), and feel sure that all existing subscribers would like
to keep in touch with each other no matter how tenuously. Therefore, would you
publish a contact list with the last issue so that we don&rsquo;t feel quite so cut off? <i>[Ed
