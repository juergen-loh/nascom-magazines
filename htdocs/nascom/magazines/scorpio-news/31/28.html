existing Z80 based activities. In fact, the arrival of the Hitachi 64180 will ensure the
continued production of our Z80 compatible systems for many years to come.

I left Nascom exactly 8 years after founding the company and am about to celebrate
my ninth anniversary at Gemini &ndash; only this time I&rsquo;m staying!
</p>
<p>
Gemini is one of the longest established companies in the micro business and this
relative longevity enables us to now contemplate pursuing a programme of rapid
expansion from a sound base.
</p>
<p>
In 1987 we began to work in close co-operation with Glasgow University with a view
to developing and marketing a range of boards and systems based around the
INMOS Transputer. This arrangement has now evolved into an exclusive agreement
which will allow us to develop a wide range of Transputer-based products.
</p>
<p>
It is interesting to compare the Nascom&nbsp;1 CPU board, designed in 1977, with the
WorkStation card developed at Gemini 11 years later, which will become the main
CPU unit for our new range of desktop Supercomputers:&ndash;

The above table shows quite clearly how far the industry has evolved in such a short
time. The first transistor was developed in the Bell labs in 1946. Thirty years later
in 1976 <?php externalLink("Zilog"); ?> designed the Z80 consisting of 8,500 transistors. Ten years after that,
INMOS manufactured the first prototype T800, a VLSI device which has more than
300,000 transistors in a single chip! In 1977 2&nbsp;MHz clock speeds were
state-of-the-art, whereas today, 25&nbsp;MHz is becoming somewhat pedestrian. I
remember the hassle we had trying to contain the system software within a <?php externalLink("2708"); ?> 1K
EPROM and how generous we thought we were by including 32 1K DRAMs then,
as opposed to the 64 1M x 8 devices on the GM8102!
</p>
<p>
Gemini transputer-based systems use building blocks of 8 transputers per card, and
these can be built up into very large systems &ndash; we have just submitted a proposal for
a machine with 384 T800 transputers and 1.636 Gigabytes of DRAM!
</p>
<p>
We also supply cards on IBM&nbsp;AT formats for more modest applications where
people are trying to enhance the speed of their application by supplementing the
host CPU with one or more Transputers.
