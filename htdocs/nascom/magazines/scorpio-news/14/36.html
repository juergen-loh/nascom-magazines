These three problems ate the most major ones and (&lsquo;ory {0 bosst but) they are ones which 1
had sleady &lsquo;dealt with my own vernon. My complamt regarding the per dump is iso oae for
stich Tne devised a soluion but I hie aot je writea the code. When dampig a lise 10 the

Another (and perhaps more major) critcism i that oo effort i, made 0 pore totally blank

ln onder to ft the ema program sue it now consists of several chained files for he various
bus, &ldquo;I have had to do ths foo, but 1 thnk the way they are spits rather sily here and&rsquo; it
&lsquo;esuls in inconvenient command structures and rater slow operation
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Well those are my moans. As I commented regarding the simple version, it helps to be. patient
with this one, but the basic concept is good, and at this low price you pay your money and makt your
hoi.

1 do oot accept fas argument about the trick routines not bemg able to move outade the
currently displayed PCB scgmest since I did write 4 version which did allow this feature
Unfortunately this process, where all the. (racks bad Io be checked for clipping against the edge
boundary of the screen before they. could be&rdquo; diplajed, deamatcally slowed down the diplay when it
was being. updated, and aller the uutial testing of the program K was decided to use the simpler
wack handling routines 1o keep the speed ofthe program up
</p>
<p>
Other mistakes um hie &lsquo;renew wachuded the aabilty of the program 10 plot 20 pia ic layouts,
the cage being it har abvaye been able to do 0 the aoly area where ths i mentioned&rsquo; im the on
Up Bele were a sac ero fas crured.&rdquo; He ao males no mention about the wmerous pes
fof pads and symbols which are avalable (12 fta)
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Also I cannol make any sense why he doesot thik that a side Mags requied for the pcb
symbols = surely uf 2 person&rsquo; requires a through hole on 2 double ded PCB they would put the
Spproprste sjmbol on oth sides at the same co-ordinates. This alo leads me onto his dea of
uplayag both sides of the PCB af the same ume, if tus was donc on a fay packed pb allthis
&lsquo;would lead to would be unrecognsable green patch on the screcs, isiead why nol yust use the &ldquo;Tip
de&rdquo; key to turn the PCB over fora beet look a he ther side
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The only ove area with which 1 could spree wth in the &lsquo;review concerned that of the printer
rouune eg ry sow&rdquo; Th bs bce cued wih cach of the PCB segments sow tenga ely
&lsquo;once and stored t2 4 temporary file which is dumped to the prifer asa whole fo produce. 11 seae
eb. The printer &lsquo;rouune however til retaie the facity&rsquo; to prt out eer individual segments
&lsquo;Quickly is order to review the PCB through iu. design wage, Or 10 print either 10 the SVC oF
rine a complete compressed mew of the eate PCB quickly
