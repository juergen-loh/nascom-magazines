This little routine will draw the predetermined box using the Clipper BOX command if compiled
or the DBIII+ @ y1,x1 TO y2,x2 command if not. The &lsquo;frame&rsquo; variable allows the characters to be
used to construct the box to be predetermined with Clipper, in DBIII+ you&rsquo;re stuck with single line
box drawing. As that little lot compiles, Clipper checks out the @ y1,x1 TO y2,x2 line as am error,
but as it never executes the code it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
</p>
<p>
Another little point from the above, the DO .. WITH and the matching <span class="uppercase">Parameters</span> in the
procedure are strictly speaking superfluous in this case as both DBIII+ and Clipper will pass
parameters from a higher level routine to a lower, and as parameters are not passed back to the
higher routine, it was not necessary to explicitly state them. I&rsquo;ve only included them for
completeness.
</p>
<p>
There are, of course dozens of little differences between DBIII+ and Clipper, almost all are
insignificant but need to be kept in mind when programming. Clipper I find is almost ideal (I
haven&rsquo;t got round Quicksilver yet). I&rsquo;ve ordered it up grade to bring my clipper more up to
date and, perhaps to remove the odd bug I&rsquo;ve found (I&rsquo;ve found two, and one is most frustrating) and
to improve compatibility with DBIII+, but to be honest, I find that there is very little which can
not be achieved with Clipper which can&rsquo;t be persuaded to work with a little imagination.
</p>
<p>
I suppose the majority of my programming effort is conducted in a combination of DBIII+ and
Clipper these days and I finished both comfortable and easy to work with.
