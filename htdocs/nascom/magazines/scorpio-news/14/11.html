So much for the past and the future. As for the preseat, it is a refreshing change to get a
regular magazine, with hard information not wallle &ndash; Mr&rsquo; Waters series on disk directories is
fexeellent, plus the &lsquo;aotes &lsquo;on ZCPRS installauos. Try finding that&rsquo; lot

&lsquo;As you say, the magazine can only survive if more material is contrbuted by others. To, this
