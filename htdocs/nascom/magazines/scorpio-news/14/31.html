&lsquo;When faced with the choice of what S-BUS disk coatrller or video card to. buy, there are
several choices on the market The final choice enust depend oot only on the dep af pocket, but ca
the eventual planned requtemeats ofthe system. So, whal are these fr a dk based system?
</p>
<p>
If we want to run CPIM, then we need some means of &lsquo;booting&rsquo; from the system dick This can
either take the form of a program loaded from tape running under some olher monitor, or as is more
&lsquo;ual, (0 load the system boot sector direct om Wisk using&rsquo; an EPROM routine running upon RESET
&lsquo;Ths boot sector m turn pages out the EPROM, loads the maun system, and eventually we get the CP/M
prompt
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The most common Boot EPROM are Gemun&rsquo;&rsquo;s SIMON and RP/M, and the Map-80 VSOFT The Gem
versons sis on the CPU card. RPM. is unguable forthe Nascom&rsquo;-? It ean, however be used on is
Bate card with 90 problem. There is a version of SIMON Tor the Nascom&rdquo; Maprai&rsquo;s VSOFT &copy; the
&lsquo;controling software for the Map-80 VPC. &ldquo;Whichever boot syeiem i chosen rellecs on the choice of
Supplier of CP/M as they include ehecks on the oot secor to determine that ais in fact a system

types and not others

MAP-80 VPC Video / Poppy Controller
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;This card, conssts of a 25:80 vdeo display, 2 parallel keyboard port, &amp; floppy disk comroller
sod the controling sofware&rsquo; (VSOFT) EPROM.&rdquo; The card is avaable ether ready&rdquo; bull, or im kil
form, &ldquo;rhe advantage of the tat approach is that you only aced to pay for the options you require
(SOFT ss part of the base card " jou can chooue any oF all of the&rsquo; Video, Video Swatch, Floppy or
Keyboard options) twill work withthe Nascom-2, GMB11, GMBL3, ad Map-CPU cards
</p>
<p>
How does it compare? The standard card uses 16 ports addressed ED &ndash; EP but alternate ports
(CD. CF are available on request. (This occeatar if wing the GMBOD FDC of Map-80 MPL)

<p>
The deo secuon is controled by a 6845, and all character handling i done by the
&lsquo;gion CPU rintiog routines a VSOFT, take ihe Geman IVC and SVC. I shold heels
pity slower, as the IVC and SVC contain thir owe Z0s. Because the system CPU tuns VSOFT.
SOFT and the video RAM can be individually paged into the memory map under port contol&rsquo; when
requied.&rdquo; (The overaid system RAM se avalible a all other times)&rdquo; The address u which VSOFT
frecutes i alzo enble it can reside at a software controled SK boundary. and told where i i

&lsquo;The card docs not havea programmable character sel, but docs have a socket for&rsquo;a 27162732. second
havacter generator This &lsquo;socket is under software control = you can select character geaerator 1
fr 2, and normal OOH-FFH, of normal OOH TFH + Laverse deo of OOH 7FH for SOH-FFH with the selected

&lsquo;The final (optional) part of the wudeo cwcuitry as a vdeo swntch which selects the output to
be either the VFC screen, or pass through an exlera? video sgaal- eg sormal output from the
Nascom2 under software control Thus means that although the VPC canaoi generate the old Nascom
format screen, (which would be at the wrong. address anyway), the ongaal Nascom screen can will be

&lsquo;The parallel Keyboard input consists of a strobed latch which is read via VSOFT The strabe

</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The final section is the Floppy Disk Controller This usee the WD2797, and ss GMBO9
compatible &ldquo;As with the GMBO, however, the clock frequency of the FDC is lak stlecable, meaning
That selection between 525&rsquo; and &amp; drives can only be dove &lsquo;by link changing. If you want software
Selection, go for the Map-MPI card or Gemust GMS29 or GMB49 instead
</p>
<p>
Control codes for the Map VC are similar 1 the Gemini IVC, but since there ic 20 onboard CPU,
there to facity to load or up wer programs oo the card Alot al screen and character
&lsquo;itnding commands are deat, bu differences creep_it concerang. character set tlection, fort
and graphics. The VFC has a programmable (an) Key sting table, whereas the IVC ean only reprogram
is fiction keys, The VEC &lsquo;does aot support a ght pea. (Many of these are. of concern, you
should naturally obtain and compare the relevant manuals)
