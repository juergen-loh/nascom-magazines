&lsquo;Those of you who are horrified by the appearance of = BASIC program in aa arucle by me have
not fll understood my &ldquo;bases for courses&rdquo; policy
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The program chooses one of the logical display colours at random, and then sets it 10 8 random
colour from the possible 4096 colours avaiable witb the samt palete. The resus eng
you Uke&rsquo; that sort of thing, &ldquo;With a good picture to work &lsquo;on, i makes most disco fights
her ordinary&rdquo; hate discos, so the may bea based judgement.
</p>
<p>
The program is sot i its ongunal form, as when I set the colour levels to INF(RND()*15), as
the Pluto anual suggested, oaly very dim colours appeared. &ldquo;In fac, the board wees the sumbes
43, 31, 47 etc, tatber thas 0, 1, 2) 3. as stated ig the manual&rdquo; I hope ths formation &lsquo;comes
tn&rsquo; time, for&lsquo;wiloever bought un pletes un the Seonyo sale. If the bostd oaly produces black and
1 ery dim election of colours try the above change of parameters.
</p>
<p>
(Other commands available on the mim palete include intinlssng the colour look up ble co
ey scale, reading and writng &lsquo;colour &lsquo;look &ldquo;up tables, changing whch rable ie ia use (ere are
{oo} aod sink rogue with variable speeds,

<p>
1 actually dithered too long before trying to buy the full palette board in the geeat sale,
whuch is an annoying thing (0 have happen when ove kas made up ones mind to speed. Thete was oaly
fe of those boards 1m the sale, and&rsquo; some lucky dev! &lsquo;bought it and saved&rsquo; fortune. I bope it i
&lsquo;working, honest!

<p>
&lsquo;What to do with graphics boards
</p>
<p>
Well, obmously, you write programs 10 produce digplaye of the Mandelbrot ct, as these are
very. prety, nod wil be recognised by aayoue who hat seen them a magazines, on the television, and
tn the Steen ofthe new pocket Cray
</p>
<p>
[Not many people know what the Mandelbrot set is, so 1 thought 1 would try to tell you
Experts, skip {0 later section. &ldquo;The idea is simple enough. You choose point (ky) in whal is
Knows as the &lsquo;complex plane. That is, the x co-ordiate ira real number, and the y co-ordinate is
socalled imaginary&rdquo; sumber, ia faces mleple af the squave root of 1
</p>
<p>
Then, you cary out transformation of the coordinates, as described by Benoit, Mandetrot,
cover andor uni! one of (things happens, Eber the co-ordinates increase rapidly, andthe
Point mover off to vafiety or it slays taside a distance of two walls from the poiat (00)
&lsquo;Aetally, the. point can&rdquo; do {wo and a bt things, and the bi w where the interest ix Some points
