In Modula 2 the definiuon as been Jef quite vague. The implementer bas. to certain
modules auch a8 system, torts, ta/out, files efe, but the exact definition of what ieee modules
contain has been left open. Never ihe less the spirit of the language is that there should&rsquo; be 0
&lsquo;ode that could not be wrttea by 8 Wer of the language.

In Modula 2 as with Pascal ts possible to define any that can be constructed from
imple types Also tm most versions of Modula 2 us the SYSTEM, cor to be more correct pseudo.
