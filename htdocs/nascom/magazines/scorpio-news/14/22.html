In Modula 2 the definition has been left quite vague. The implementer has to provide certain
modules such as system, texts, in/out, files etc., but the exact definition of what these modules
contain has been left open. Never the less the spirit of the language is that there should be no
code that could not be wrtten by a user of the language.
</p>
<p>
Here Borland have infringed on this suggestion, in providing procedures <i>write</i> and <i>writeln</i> which
can have a variable number of parameters, i.e. they are like the Pascal equivalents, but in the same
way as Turbo Pascal has become the de facto standard for pascal, as it provided users with the
extensions they wanted, Turbo Modula 2 may also become a de facto standard for the same reasons.
</p>
<p>
In the Borland implementation of the language the following simple types are available:
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>INTEGER</td><td>-32,768 to 32.767,</td></tr>
<tr><td>LONGINT</td><td>-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647,</td></tr>
<tr><td>CARDINAL</td><td>0 to 65535,</td></tr>
<tr><td>REAL</td><td>-6.80565E+38 to -6.80565e+38,</td></tr>
<tr><td>LONGREAL</td><td>-3.59538626967246D+308 to 3.5....D+308</td></tr>
<tr><td>CHAR</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BOOLEAN</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In Modula 2 as with Pascal it is possible to define any datatype that can be constructed from
simple types. Also in most versions of Modula 2 is the SYSTEM module, or to be more correct pseudo-module,
in which version dependent code is located and the dirty tricks definitions are included.
In this version the types BYTE, WORD, ADDRESS and PROCESS are defined, the first three are obvious,
I hope, but the last is a facility for allowing concurrent processes to occur allowing transfer
of information between processes. An analogy in another high level language is hard to think of,
the use of system common, or shared EMA in Fortran is similar but much more limited. To achieve a
similar effect in Fortran usually involves direct operating system calls.

In this version of Modula 2, you can supply modules written in Microsoft Macro 80 compatible
code, (as .REL files), which can be linked into main code once the appropriate definition module
has been written. The Turbo environment is a particularly friendly environment to work in, you can
set various options when compiling, for example you can turn the extensions to the standard off, you
can make the compiler ignore case, in standard identifiers (such as END). Range and maths checks
can be switched on or off, but the usual comments about wearing a lifebelt on load and taking it off
when you go to sea apply in these cases and a listing of compilation can be obtained.

An interesting feature of this compiler is that it may compile to interpreted code or to native
code the choice m left up to the user. Usually code is compiled to the interpreted form, for
testing and then compiled to native code when fully debugged, but sometimes for compactness of code,
it will be left as interpreted code. There are some bugs in the compiler in this area, I have had
interpreted code work and native code then produced and turn its toes up.
</p>
<p>
The linker can produce either a .COM file, of can link together interpreted modules to reduce
disk search time. The linker can be controlled in much the same way as linkers on super-minis and
main frames, allowing direct formation of overlays and control of initialisation. Remember in
Modula 2, each module may have a <i>main</i> as well as procedures.
</p>
<p>
The librarian is also an essential item of any Modula 2 system and the Turbo one is easy to
use, quite like LU in its behaviour.
</p>
<p>
The shell is particularly friendly, allowing access to the editor, compiler linker and
librarian, without leaving its environment. Particularly useful to hard disk users is the ease of
moving from one user area to another and the ability to produce a directory list across the disk
including all user areas. Access to file management utilities such as rename, copy, and delete are
also provided.
</p>
<p>
The FTL Modula 2 (MSDOS version) comes with two manuals, one of 90 pages explaining the
compiler in relation to the MSDOS operating system, and the second (of 105 pages) describing the
language. It would not be possible to learn the language from these manuals alone, they do not
claim to teach the language and should not be expected to do so. The manual contains some examples
of code but these tend to be notes describing features rather than full program code.
