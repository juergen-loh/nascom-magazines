Editor&rsquo;s Notes on new 80-BUS Products
</h2>
<p>
In this issue there are articles describing three new 80-BUS CPU boards. As none of these
products is actually in production as I write this, past experience tells me that there may well be
changes to their specifications, even if only minor, before they are generally available.
</p>
<p>
I trust that the articles have whetted appetite, but would strongly recommend that you
obtain firm specifications from the manufacturers or their dealers before committing yourself to a
purchase. It may well be that there are limitations as to what other 80-BUS boards may be used in
the system with these new products (e.g. you may HAVE to have am SVC rather than an IVC, or a GM849A
rather than s GM809, GM829 or GM849, etc.), so do check first
</p>
<p>
As far as the GM886 80286 board is concerned, the level of software compatibility will have to
be taken into consideration. There is little doubt that this will be a high performance product,
and you will be able to run the MS-DOS Operating System. However, because of the very nature of the
rest of the 80-BUS system around this new board, particularly the video side, this means that there
must be some limitations as to what MS-DOS applications can be run. Do NOT expect to be able to run
the infamous Flight Simulator program&nbsp;!
</p>
<p>
<i>Please note that the above few paragraphs are included here, not to put you off purchasing the
boards, but to make sure that you make yourself aware that what you may be purchasing will do what
you want. Happy shopping!</i>
