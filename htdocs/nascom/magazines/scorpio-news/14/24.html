&lsquo;The Neuburn NEB ss 4 SI2K, batten-bicked state RAM board, 4 aew board from Newbura
lecromics. It&rsquo;s designed (0 be upwards compatible wt ihe GMBS3 RAM-dick board. An mportant
Uhlferenc thatthe boards battery-backed
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;All dave files are retained when power is removed &amp; returned. So when you switch oa your 80-
BUS &ldquo;sytem all Hles are tll &ldquo;ntact @ ready 10 run. &ldquo;Har anyone ele&rdquo; over switched. Off their
computer before saving the &lsquo;M&rdquo; driv, ori it only me that does that srt a thing?
</p>
<p>
The board is designed to accept all future memory 1Cs using both 28 pun and 32 un formats
Whenever the G11024-LP devices are pried dow, the hoard wil be easily upgraded to 2MBytes.
</p>
<p>
Being battery-backed, the system tracks may be put on the boatd. Why would you wich to do this
when you, needa foppy disk to pul there ia the fist place? Well&rdquo; for one thing, speed. A
&lsquo;stem &ldquo;wal! boot from &ldquo;Mr dave just sbout immediately. &ldquo;Also, once the stem tack &lsquo;eon the
board, you ean take the (physical) dik drives away
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The usual SIMON boot EPROM will na enable a cold-boot without &raquo; (physical) disk in deve
Instead, Newbura will update your SIMON boot EPROM 10 enable ths The boot up operanon checks for
gigahd gem ock. TP Tod, boas fore IF aot fund goes on to bow from (psc)

My particular application was a small control system, where cost &amp; dust prevented the use of
te usual &ldquo;disk diver&rdquo; The system &ldquo;had Yo auto boot on poweron, or reel. The compete sem
&lsquo;consisted of a GMBL3 CPU/RAM, NESS RAM dick, GMBI6 UO boaid, and GMBI? PSU, ia a. MuliNet
workstation ease. Some additional circuitry was imcloded for ampot and output buffenng. &ldquo;A row of
&lsquo;Kipposs were mounted on the zeat ofthe workstation ease
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The software was writen, in Twwbo Pascal tested on a disk-based system, and loaded into the
[NE8E) bodrd. &ldquo;The system track Was &ldquo;RAMgenned&rdquo; ont0 the NESE) board. &ldquo;Thi ie a program supplied
&lsquo;with the boot EFROM to copy 2 CPIM. onto the board. The write-Protect switch was ve, the board then
{Femoved from the development stem sad useted no the &ldquo;arg&rdquo; works.
</p>
<p>
ll weed creed, ncn sane ups of ay awat The sum oot from eld and ran
immediately. 2p fact, you could et see the effects of pressing reset on the system, being co Fast.
</p>
<p>
1 forgot that one of the Bes on the disk needed to be changed at frequent interals. Write:
rotectng the &lsquo;board dit nol low that Because the wrteprolect i also&rdquo;on the edge of the
Boards Tas able to wire Keyewich oi, 30 the operator could ake changes af requred
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;A useful thing would be 10 mix sie RAM and EPROM om the sume board. The problem is that the
dick directory needs to be wrie-allowed. Newbura say they are working on something If more Uhan
&lsquo;one board ve ured in a system, the problem does not arse.&rdquo; Ose board can contain EPROM, the other
</p>
<p>
Siauc memory. The Gemm BIOS &ldquo;oaly supports ove &ldquo;Mf drive. &ldquo;Fortunately, i is possble to. obtain
&lsquo;modified CPIM. to support 4.&rsquo;bM&rdquo; drives. &ldquo;The boards have 2 il sinches Io select one of 4 drives
Tn thas CP/M, the *M&rdquo; dives are ABC &amp; D_ Usng EPROM allows large programs to be stored quite
</p>
<p>
cheaply The NES89 is avalable from Newura without any memory ICs, &ldquo;Ths enables EPROMS up to 1
IMBite per socket (they are 32-Pin) ging &raquo; pose 16MByter of EPROM dick
</p>
<p>
Using the standard Gemini BIOS, up to 16, NESS: can be fitted ia the sytem as the same dime
swe S"DitSwatches &lsquo;08 the board &ldquo;provide address sclecion. [Ed actualy the Gemini BIOS$
ceurenty ty (i) sippor up 10 2MB of RAN disk}
</p>
<p>
On a Network Workstauon, the NESS provides further benefits Using the modified Boot, the
workstation boots up directly to a &ldquo;Silicon system&rdquo; gwving SI2K of battery-backed files &lsquo;This
&lsquo;lows personal les to be kept off the Flsserver&rdquo; if the Network 1 down for aay reason, maybe
&lsquo;guick game of Colossus Adveature&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
{de MultiNet Logon program is kept on &ldquo;Mf, the Network can be booted a any time.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, f have found the NESGD board very useful, both ine suandard Galen, and ma
contol sytem. Ica wait unt the larger stahe memory TCs become avaiable
