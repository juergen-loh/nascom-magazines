&lsquo;The pre-read may be skipped under cerium cxcumstances CP/M elle the BIOS that the data

Having read the cequired physical sector, the bulfer im use fag ss set and the CP/M record may

&lsquo;The only exception to the above explanation is when directory information is being. writen to

So where does Modula 2 fit? Well ths u a kit car, buit with strength of VoNO- it a
iter all&rsquo;s member of the. Algol family, 4 child of &lsquo;Nicklaus &ldquo;Wirth, ut bas all the vertatlty. of
Fortran. &lsquo;Modula 2 bas been used by Wirth to correct many of the mustakes of Pascal, the rather
fussy and, confusing sytax has bees cdied up, (I could never remember when T needed 1 semicolon and
&lsquo;whea I didn&rsquo;t) and the most powerful feature of Fortran, the foundation i ibrary based. code,

<p>
Modula 2, at it name suggest, encourages you to wnte modular code. These modules. are
combined into libraries, and programs created by importing, code into the program from these
libraries &ldquo;The library &lsquo;will usually consis of Modula 2 code, wt 1 a very recursive language,
&lsquo;Modula? code 1 made from Modula 2 code which is made from Modula 2 code which t but tt most
i aot all apptetions, cade from other repeatable code producing tous can be Iitiod voto the

</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The two versions of Modula 2 1 will renew ae Turbo Modula 2 ffom Borla International (only
availble for CP/M at the moment) and FTL Modula 2 from Workman and Associates (HiSof im the U.K)
Wich savadable for MSDOS aad CPIM, the versioa reviewed being tbe MSDOS variant.

<p>
The Hovland versoa of the language comes complete with a SM page manual describing the
language, the Wosdutar like eduor the shell andthe Standard library Supplied the noedued
