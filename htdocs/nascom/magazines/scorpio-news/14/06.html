<p>
It is also worth noting that CP/M 2.2 takes less CCP memory than the alternatives which,
therefore, give the programmer the largest TPA possible thus cutting down the seed for overlay
files.
</p>
<p>
The on-board memory (1&nbsp;MByte for a standard card) above 64k will be used as a RAM disk called
&lsquo;O&rsquo;. This will be much faster than the &lsquo;M&rsquo;equivalent because the CPU will be running at 10&nbsp;MHz
versus 4&nbsp;MHz on the
<?php externalLink("GM813","",""); ?>.
The new BIOS, however, will still support &lsquo;M&rsquo; drives. Another possible
application for the large amount of on-board memory could be the track buffering of floppies or
Winchesters, thereby giving very fast access to files, or accelerating spooler type applications.

<h3>
MARKETS
</h3>
<p>
Since the design concept embraces total compatibility with the
<?php externalLink("GM813"); ?>
Gemini see the following markets for the product:
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis indent">
<li>Existing and future MultiNet users for both Fileservers and Workstations.</li>
<li>CAD-8 users.</li>
<li>Disk conversion products such a the DX-3.</li>
<li>ODIN development systems.</li>
<li>Computer enthusiasts who have traditionally worked in a Z-80 environment.</li>
<li>Turbo charging of packages based upon original Z-80 based software</li>
</ol>
<p>
With an anticipated speed acceleration of over 2.5 times of the existing Z-80, new systems
based around the
<?php externalLink("GM880"); ?>
are going to be able to run almost as fast as an AT clone, and if you take
into account the speed advantages that are added to a system by the
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
and the RAM disk the
combined effect will be to provide a very competitive alternative to even the latest 80386 type
products.
</p>
<p>
Look out IBM, Compaq, et al!

<h3>
PRICING
</h3>
<p>
The end-use price of a board with 1&nbsp;MBye of RAM will be &pound;450.00.
</p>
<h3>
AVAILABILITY
</h3>
<p>
The design should be completed by end of the July, and Gemini would anticipate a further 3
month will elapse befor it can go into production.
