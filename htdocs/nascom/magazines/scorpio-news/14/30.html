Light Pea forthe SVC:
</p>
<p>
1 have wanted one of these for quite some tume, and eventually saw an rule describing one in
the Maplin magazine &lsquo;The article describes a derign for which a kit is available from Maplin,
faturaly &ldquo;Although the unt is not supposed to be for use wath &lsquo;SVCs, T thought it just might
&lsquo;Work, andthe price was fay reasonable
</p>
<p>
Ws an easy kat to buuld, with only siggle IC used to shape the pulse from the ght
sense wanestor Unfortunately, at preseat all T get om it iz random aumbers, I suspect the
Pen circuit w producing a negative pulse, and the documentation for tbe SVC doesat say what kind
Ot pulse itis expecting. Postive, probably
</p>
<p>
The other possinlty tht occured 10 se was that petbips the pen was. picking up Lo much
stray light or Vana propery chided rom Tbe elsuled Gout&rsquo; Mar putl"oste, sould be
IDtrested to bear fom, seyone with expenence of tng ight pes withthe&rdquo; SVC, and wil watraly
pas on anything that works proper

&lsquo;Expanding Nascoms?
</p>
<p>
Ben Marun wrote to me, expanding on his suggestons for an amateur priced exteasoa, board for
S-BUS sptens tone her taps (The other things welded a suggestion. that 1 sbould. stop
sang Siva ay orng ob, and do someting paste To gt out of he a. He bas &amp; oa, batt
xjoya ood moan, and cat promise not toda more of even if scape the rat)
</p>
<p>
He has obviouly put quite a lot of thought ato ways of making elderly Nascoms and 80-BUS
machines is general able to use IBM type daca (well cant the MPD sence do this already? Tl must
bbe possible) Ed = items running Gemini BIOS 22 or later can readiwnte IBM&nbsp;PC:DOS dicks with
the TBM-COPY program, availabe scparteh,| and esade_ some snteresting. suggestions about how &ldquo;we
ould use their software by emulating ie hardware. It wouldn&rsquo;t go fat enough. Bu neve mind.
</p>
<p>
Marna has now reached 1 slage of expansion where there arc only three slots left on the eather
board, and I am not sure I wast 10 add more processmig power to the brute. For a star, there are
already two boards contending for set of port addresses the modem and the Beleetrs bosid. The
buss heavily weed already, withthe Pluo and SVC i situ
</p>
<p>
1 have considered various processors as possible candidates for an expansion board, ranging
from exotic bit slice thnge from Texas, (o tie 32032 from National Semiconductor The&rsquo; ater is
00 compler, The obvious choice of processor, #f one wants real power, is the Transputer, of
ther, low of them.&rdquo; Al the moment, they cow a lot But aotung fale ike the price &ldquo;of chips,
Sind some time room, they should reach a seauble level I have been looking at (OU courses which
teach Oceam, go T wil be ready to program them. But rather thin baag them onto Marin, and make
fim even moe complex, I have dectded (0 ball eeasons to the system Nol that Tam goug (0 Bel
fad of Marvin; too many useful functions. to 1st are now second ature on ths machine.&rdquo; But 1 am
fetung anes machine.&rdquo; It val be used i conjuction with Marna, oace I work, out an inierface
adi &lsquo;all not be an IBM type machine. After all these years of rtcising&rdquo; machines &lsquo;wah plastic
&lsquo;eases, and making side remarks thou! WIMP, am going to have both
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The machine in question i expandable, although sot 2s easly ab an 80-BUS computer is, and it
ss mulivisioag and an ideal candidate for ase with Tratsputers, as a &ldquo;ont end Um geting
fan Amiga &ldquo;A300 I And before you say it ua&rsquo;t 18M compatible, and is therefore a ade-track, in
fvolution, I should point &lsquo;out thal Erich Aerospace ate Using &ldquo;A000 as workstations because. they
Ste s0 mich better than IBM, Somebody demonstrated oe tome, and f was booked. The mouse it
ood, and the. graphics are (gulp) beter than the Pluto. It has poor BASIC, but Modula 2 is
asl) avaiable, and worth bai
</p>
<p>
I hope that 1 will become good enough with the machine to write about it, but will probably
sead any suff T produce about it fo Amiga based magazines, I feel it would be&rsquo; out of place here
&lsquo;part tone details 6f how I connect the two machines, perhaps I manage 1 doit.
</p>
<p>
Ie as omg to feel very strange, alter ll these years, baving amache the same as other
seopl&rsquo;s&rdquo; ft &lsquo;bes. luury, too, being able To buy progam instead of having 10&Prime; wie them
