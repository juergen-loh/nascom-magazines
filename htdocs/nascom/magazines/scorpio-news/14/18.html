In the example DPB given, BLM has a value of 31 and BSH has a value of 5. Their we es exactly

looks something lite the one given below:

<p>
We shall use the values for the Gemusi QDS format m ths example and co we can see thal the
leectory entry controls four extents For convenience we sball qumber the extents 0 to 3. Exteat

<p>
Since we are using a 4K block size, each block wil coatun 32 CPIM records of 128 bytes each
&lsquo;We ehall number those Fecords Oto 31
</p>
<p>
If we logcally AND the required extent (18) with the exent mask (3) we obtain the value 2.
&lsquo;This means shat the record we requse 1 costaned in the extent mumbered 2 in our directory ealy.
