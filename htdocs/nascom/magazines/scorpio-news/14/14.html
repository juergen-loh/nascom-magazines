The only problem with RAM instead of disk is that it is volatile. You must obviously remember

<h3>
BDOSZ Fixes
</h3>
<p class="noindent">
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Many tjanks for publishing my last letter in which I offered free upgrades for BDOSZ. The
response to the letter was absolutely overwhelming and all four people should have their updated
copy by now. Since the last letter, BDOSZ has now had a couple of minor alterations and one small
bug fix, and the version now stands at 1.02.
</p>
<p>
The bug caused data written to a previously allocated sector to be forgotten when the file was
closed. A typical example was under ZAP or SPZ where the first record of a file was patched and ZAP
exited. Some users found that the changes hadn&rsquo;t been written to disk. The problem was that
although the data was sent to the  BIOS, it remained in blocking/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>deblocking buffer. The BDOS
wasn&rsquo;t causing the buffer to be flushed when the file was closed, and the buffer was discarded on
warm boot.
</p>
<p>
The bug fix is published below and is valid, certainly for all versions from, 1.6 onwards The
unmodified code is shown in full. The change involves deleting those lines indicated &lsquo;&nbsp;&lt;---&nbsp;&rsquo;. My
thanks to Philip Sherlock of Kenilworth Computers for bringing this bug to my attention.
</p>

<p>
For those who obtained an upgrade to version 1.8 (&nbsp;the last version issued to Henry&rsquo;s Radio for
distribution) and who are wondering whether they have missed out, versions 1.9 and 1.91 only added
options to revere the effect of the Backspace and Delete keys or to make them both Backspaces. They
also offered improved Control-S handling so that the Control-S is no longer ignored if there is
already a character waiting in the BDOS character store (try pausing M80 if you have it sending the
listing file to the screen if you have already typed another character). The penalty for this
second improvement is that the BDOS will now steal type-ahead characters&nbsp;&ndash; this why the feature
is optional.
</p>
<p>
My offer is still open for those who have yet to upgrade their versions of BDOSZ. Please send
your BDOSZ distribution disk to the address below, enclosing your name and address together with
U.K. postage stamps to cover the cost of returning it to you. Overseas readers may send a cheque
payable to M.W.T. Waters.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, M.W.T. Waters, _ _________ _____, Stanmore, Middx. ___ ___.
