<h3>
Nascom &ndash; 10 Years On
</h3>
<p>
Thank you to everyone who wrote in about the proposed <i>Nascom &ndash; 10 Years On</i> event. There was an
avalanche of mail on the topic, and you have given us a lot to consider. Whatever we do I am sure
that it will be an event to remember. In due course we will be writing directly to all of you who
have been in touch with us, it still isn&rsquo;t too late.
</p>
<p>
To re-cap, this November will be the 10th anniversary of the launch of Nascom&nbsp;1, the machine
that started (well, almost) the 80-BUS that we all know and love today. We are going to arrange a
&ldquo;happening&rdquo; and have asked readers to write in and let us know what they would like the event to be
(see last <a href="../text/"></a>issue&rsquo;s <i>Editorial</i>). We are then going to take an &ldquo;average&rdquo; of the suggestion. So, if
you too are interested, the please let us know soon (in writing).
<h3>
What&rsquo;s New
</h3>
<p>
Ever so often sometime will say to me &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pity that 80-BUS is dying out &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s
great. Why are there no new developments taking place?&rdquo; Well, maybe Gemini&rsquo;s laid-back policy to
publicity (i.e. they really don&rsquo;t tend to do very much) is the reason, but there has never been a
let-up in 80-BUS developments, and I think that this issue of <i>Scorpio News</i> shows that there is still
much going on.
</p>
<p>
In the following pages you will find details of THREE new 80-BUS CPU boards. As I write, none
of the boards are actually here yet (what&rsquo;s new?), but they all exist in pre-production form and so
should be with us RSN (Real Soon Now). I was going to offer some advice on how to choose between
the 64180 and the Z280 based boards but I haven&rsquo;t really had chance to way up the pros-and-cons myself
yet. Please do read my notes on <a href="../../53/text/#article2">page&nbsp;53</a>.
</p>
<p>
You will also find a brief technical specification of Gemini&rsquo;s 80286 CPU/RAM board. Now do you
see another reason why we thought that it was becoming appropriate to include some coverage on MS-DOS
in <i>Scorpio News</i>? And there may be yet another purpose soon!
