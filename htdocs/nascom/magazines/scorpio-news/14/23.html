In addiuon to the types described for the Turbo Modula 2 an additional type LONGCARDINAL (32
bit unsigned integer) is available. A aight difference between the wo seveons im the range of
REALS, FTL reals are. described us about 16 dap accuracy with an exponential range of &ndash;105 to. +105,
sserly 2 comparison wath Turbo, but better by a loog way than soy Foruaa Ihave used. As with
&lsquo;Turbo any type canbe crested fom the sunple types and BYTE, WORD and ADDRESS are predefined,

&lsquo;The FTL editor, bendes being fis, enables up to tice flee to be edited at once wath the
screen split wo three windows, &ldquo;Ths may seem 1 loeury, bul 1m Module 2&Prime; you offea aced to ook &lsquo;up

Turbo which has very strong type) You can copy code between &lsquo;be windows, which if you afe a cul

The code for the editor, writen in Modula 2 can be obtained, allowing you to customse the
cditor &ldquo;You can already cusiomue to a lage exeal, as aay keys have emacfos altacbed To them,
fg ESC Tis THEN, and you can define your own macros, A minor niggle is that backspace is NON
&lsquo;structive and Del. &lsquo;deletes backwards stead of forwards. " Though have changed the Del, kev
&lsquo;macro definition eo tha isthe same as Turbo&rsquo;, f coulda&rsquo; chang the backspace definition,

&ldquo;The compiler can be run from the editor, ether m Fast check mode wich produces 09 output of

atthe error location, with reasonable explanations of the error it is possible to force further
Compton ignonag the error &ldquo;This can not be done. wih the Turbo compiler, but i aso takes
the tor tnd wen the cor weed twa seeompiing fom the begin of th module

thee Tetures wan nreiarka, very fast compiler

&lsquo;The linker can also be made to run ftom the editor, but I have failed to do so. This is

Fhe linker produces COM flee &ldquo;Ageia i 1 varemarkable in iis behaviour, just well behaved
Rather than remove the last comment T have decided (0 poiat oul it was my misunderstanding of the
th command SET PATH= works, SET PATH = (which w the correct form in RTE) docs not work. The
an be invoked as well from the editor end the object program rus, all wih oul leaning the

&lsquo;A surpnsig part of this package is an SORB assembler, using the standard small memory model
(64x &ldquo;data, Gak code) Its included a0&rdquo; that you can Compile the assembly languages brary
SSodules of any asembly languages modules that you wre yursel, &ldquo;This auembler i realy 8 tay

&lsquo;The lbearan is aguin LU Hike, aot quite a fnenly as the Turbo Libranan of LU

<p>
Alo provided is a debugger, but it would be more exact to describe it as a tracer rather than
a debugger If the trace option is switched on in the compiler and linker, the modules. whea
txecuted wll printout their progress onthe sereee

<p>
In completion the package contans a tort, module and maths module which contin such useful
items, such as sunt inversion (Gauss method, &lsquo;wth. Paral pret) = ths ws restricted 10-10 % 10
satrices, but you want to solve larger matnces, perhaps you should be using a mai anyway
</p>
<p>
ta conclusion, both of these packages ze goad value for money, proving a cheap catty ato
the world of Male &reg; &ldquo;I hope thr reneny a wddion fo sbowng the&rdquo; sens &lsquo;of tite packages,

<p>
will also tempt you to try wong programs inthis new language
