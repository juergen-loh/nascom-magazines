<h2>
Cylindrical and Track methods of Disk access
</h2>
<p>
&lsquo;There are two methods of accessing disks, The first wethod to start on, sido 1 of the
ted umber the tacks from sty&rsquo;0 to 7 (ODDS) thes fp de and cll he uacts, 8 to 19.&rdquo; No
tha &lsquo;hi pst or comvemcace ate tracks on side 2 of the dk a abo psy sumbered
(0-7, &ldquo;As far as CPIM is concerned, it is aocing a angle sided disk with 160 tacks.&rdquo; Ths ig known
1 the Track method of accessing a disk
</p>
<p>
The second method ss to have the tracks on both sides of the disk numbered from s4y 0 to H
(DDDS) and having filled track O on ade 1 we flip sides and cootinue wring to tack 000 side. 2
&lsquo;of the disk. In this cate. CP/M thinks it serng 1 single ded dick with 38 tracks but the tracks
fre twice a6 long as before (ie. 80 SPT). Thus method of acces is known as the &lsquo;nelhod.
&lsquo;You ould note that the Gemioi Quad density format is a susnomer used by a number of companies In
realty shouldbe called 80 track double denstyor double deasity with double track density

BLM, BSH and EXM
</h2>
<p>
&lsquo;The block mask (BLM) is basically one less than the umber of 128 byte records that will Bt ia
fone block Our figure of 31 means that 32 records will ft in the block This enables the BDOS (0
Calculate the block size as, you will have noticed, it #0&rsquo;t given in the DPB. if we take the
</p>
<p>
current record count Grom the FCB aad logealy AND i wit the block mask, we wil obtain 8 number
in the range 031. which (ells us where im a block the particular second may be found. Take, for
raze, tat the current record count is 92 or O1OL00. &lsquo;If&rsquo;we AND that fighre with 31 or 000
&lsquo;we get the result 00011100 or 28. &lsquo;This indicates that the record occupies the 25: (0-31 remember)
&lsquo;ecotd position inthe block,
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The extent mask (EXM) 1 one less than the umber of extents that may be controlled by one
rectory entry &ldquo;This depends upon the masimum disk ze. as, uf 16 bit values are. recorded in the
&lsquo;dzectory, then each directory entry. will refer to hall the oumber of exeals than it &lsquo;woud if 8 bit
fentner were. being used. In the case of the QDDS format, this value 3 which indicates that 4
tents may be recorded in a single duectory cary When used as a mask by ANDing the exteat bye
fof the direcory entry with EXM, we produce a tumber ia tbe range 0-3 which ell the BDOS which
&lsquo;neat we are tefernag athe entry
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The next eld is the Block Shift Factor (BSH), and xs used by the BDOS when converting CPIM
records and extents into block posivons wn a directory eoty and voce versa, BSH as the
Igganthm base two. ofthe block far m 128 byte records or, LOG2(BLS/38) where LOG? represents the
binary logarithm funcoos, That last bit more or less a direct quote from Digital Research and
&lsquo;probably means as much fo you now asi did vo me
