Yes &ndash; let&rsquo;s disassemble clones.

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
On the general point of whether to move the mag. to support the IBM&nbsp;PC world, as Dave Hunt
suggests, I would afree with him, though I should state my bias as an owner of both close and
Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom hybrid.
</p>
<p>
The expertise of the early group of enthusiasts who built their own machines and managed to
squeeze programs into 1k of memory is still valid, and perhaps more so in the clone world where
information is sadly lacking &ndash; no circuit diagrams or port maps in the Taiwanese PC world (or even
with the Greenock real ones), or very expensive &ndash; the technical reference manual cost a
staggering &pound;70 or thereabouts. The skill of the average MultiBoard enthusiast, most being hardware-software
hybrids, should, put together, rapidly disassemble the hidden store of information on these
machines.
</p>
<p>
Finally, beloved 8 bit CP/M machines are long in the tooth, and through superior 16 bit
machines when dealing with text applications, we will have to admit they are coming to the end of
their golden age.

<i>Ed. &ndash; some &ldquo;compatibles&rdquo; DO come with circuit diagrams, see the review in the last Scorpio News,
although I understand that most do not. As to your beloved machine coming to the end of its age,
perhaps the new product information in this issue will change your mind?</i>

<h3>
A few points
</h3>
<p class="noindent">
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I thought I should write to inform you (and the readership) of a few points which have come to
my notice, but before I start moaning I must say how mech I enjoy reading <i>Scorpio News</i>. It must be
just about the only computer / electronics related magazine which dows not send me barmy with
technical errors.
</p>
<p>
I have had a rather funny week since receiving the Scorpio Systems SVC-03 disk that I ordered.
During the week I found bugs in MLINKS, PCB and finally in my newly aquired copy of HiSoft C, and
all this with my untrusty old GM809 FDC board giving up on me. No doubt you will be glad to know
that the MLINKS bug is very easily fixed. It relates to the PCI and GPS commands which, on my copy
at least, write and read garbage. This is because they assume the default CP/M DMA at 80h without
checking that MBASIC has not moved it. MBASIC, of course, has moved it. The solution is quite
simple, just use the BDOS function &ldquo;Set DMA address&rdquo; (cods 26). This cam be done at the end of the
disk commons routines thus only needing to be written once.
</p>
<p>
Find &ldquo;discom:&rdquo;&nbsp;, move dons to &ldquo;endlin:&rdquo; and find the &ldquo;ret&rdquo; instruction at the end (3 lines
down) and insert:
</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td>ld</td><td>de,thuff</td><td>; This is 80h</td></tr>
<tr><td>ld</td><td>c,26</td><td>; Set DMA address</td></tr>
<tr><td>call</td><td>bdos</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">
This occupies extra space, but the space can be recovered by removing two unnecessary BDOS calls in
PSI. Shortly after creating the new with:
</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td>ld</td><td>de,fcb</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>r</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>ld</td><td>c,16h</td><td>; create file</td></tr>
<tr><td>call</td><td>bdos</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">
you will find:
</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td>ld</td><td>de,fcb</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>r</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>ld</td><td>c,0fh</td><td>; open file</td></tr>
<tr><td>call</td><td>bdos</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
