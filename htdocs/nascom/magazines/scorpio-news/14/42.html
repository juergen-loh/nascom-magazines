Perhaps I&rsquo;m being unfair 10 the DCONVERT program, because t was. my foul in asing &lsquo;Y ao the
fir place, an invitation for confusion In places where DCONVERT had stsumed &lsquo;2 logal variable,
A had marked it ia the source, and any Other&rdquo; dovbtil bie as well skbough would sometimes
&lsquo;mise colons when they were neitber in drive aasgaments or tex Noge the less, { converted. acres
Of files this Way, and the majority worked staght away The only pay was thal DCONVERT ida
Convert the STORE type assignments to &ldquo;=&rdquo; type assignments, I eaded up doing that by hand

There are many other dliferences but they are maualy tasgiicant am oature, the extra power
of DBI and. DBI comes ffom the sew facies these ave many and &lsquo;overcome a lot of the
Seficencies of DBI. Take for instance che lack of fst subroutine call (procedures) ia DBM &lsquo;To
e&rsquo;s procedure, you wrole a separate litle program to do your procedure bit, then told DBI! to
&lsquo;Dore

&lsquo;The problem was, that a6 the program was soterprcted, and to keep the memory utilisation low,
BU read&rsquo; the program fom disk at i went along. bad to drop the current part of the program,
agen the pew Procete fi, do lathe &lsquo;led he cary om wha wa ig Before
fe procedure tured up Alf vety disk amtensie &lsquo;and slow particulary i the procedure wat intde
&lsquo;loop of some kind
</p>
<p>
a fact fom an operating speed port of view, DBI acwely discouraged the use of procedures
pI and DBIIT+ iureduced&rsquo;s ew Gea Again to Keep the memory allation under clara the
progres is read from disk as before, bul (a mutant of 32) procedures can now be grouped togeber th
ne&rsquo; fle and opened &lsquo;before the program. starts As ths fle i opened, before the program sar,
nd aot closed afterwards (unless fou Mave a auaber of &ldquo;procedures? files and therefore open
nother) the whole process becomes ies dk intense

Azote afes vhete DBI was defcest was the fact tat only to databases could be opened.
the same tome &ldquo;With DBI and BMI pio ten databases may be opened at once, Dul care ae to the
otal number of open files (program fice&rdquo; databases and indents) must Ge exceed With up 10 10

&lsquo;Another mayor change is the increased sumber of vanables (256) and the use of local vanables
within procedures, a bi oF Pascalsh that, bul i can eatch the uswary. Unless a varable is
Aeclared PUBLIC atthe start, or declare before it&rsquo;s passed fo the procedure oF passed using the

<p>
command, followed by a matching PARAMETERS command in the procedare, strange thiags happen, and
&lsquo;ariabies which would have een passed under DBI don&rsquo;t yet passed under DBM On tbe whole ths
Iechange for the better but takes a liltle geting used fo, particularly if you are converting

&lsquo;The maumum umber of fields the field lengths and sumbers of records have all grown and are

DO WHILE &lsquo;oops have gained an EXIT command, so that a DO WHILE 1. can be exited with ease fom
