1 have been &lsquo;playing&rsquo; with a selection of GEM software for the lat fow weeks, and had hoped to
preseat a detnled reve of it here. However, the information oo the vious new B0-BUS CPU boards
fre and T fet tha the Spee shouldbe ven ove to then&rdquo; Coeseguay wha flows. ut
Abnef over-mew and taster, and I hope that P shal write a much more report on GEM and
&lsquo;anous GEM applicabons inthe near future.

GEM comes from Digital Research, and stands for Graphics Environment Basealy,
although&rsquo; doubt that DR&rsquo; would officially agree with this is anteation is to bring MAC (ype
faciiues to PC compatibles, xe. it provides 3 WIMPs eanrontient&rsquo; (Windows, [eons, Mouse, Pull-dows
&lsquo;menus.
</p>
<p>
Installing GEM is a doddle. It supports a wide range of hardware, and you jost answer the
vanous optiots tbat it gives ou. Kcan be run&rsquo; on floppy or Winchester based &lsquo;ystems. Video can
be CGa, EGA (in various options), or Hercules, &lsquo;A large assortment of praters are supported, as af
plotter. Diferent mce are supported, and also graphics ables.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;With GEM mstalled you can go out and ge vanety of packages. The anes Ihave are
GEM Draw Plas GEM Graph GEM Pat GEM WordChart GEM Write
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;When you get the packages home, you just asert the master dick in a drive, un a program on
that dist, and after a bit of whining ss all doae So what, you say? Welly the clever bit
rely te grap sree and&rdquo; pra uppor. You se wn You ad&rsquo;8 new GEM, appicaton 1
Your syetem you don&rsquo;t need (o tell it anything about Your hardware (compare that to. puthag. sew WP
Jottware on Gemini TVCSVC) The software interface between the application package and. you
iardware ie GEM ise I suppose an analogy can be made wath CP/M, as folows: (CP/M handle all
disk acess for any application program, and the program isnot interested io whetber its use
floppy disk, bard &lsquo;dak, RAMdsk or whatever, and&rsquo; lsat aterested ib. the. exact capaci). avaable,
so with GEM applications, they dost eare what the graphice resolution s&amp; whether its monochrome
&lsquo;or colour, or what the printer or plotter recoltion i= these sapets are handled by GEM.

<p>
The masa portion of GEM is called GEM Desktop, GEM Desktop effectwely becomes your Operating
System prompt. &ldquo;From GEM Desktop You can basically do anyung that you can fiom the MS-DOS prompt,
