I noticed immediately that the bugs I meationed have bees fixed. This version eaters for
boards up to 86&Prime; x 8.6&Prime;, handles double sided boards and includes = dump routine for Epson
compatibles (the width ve restncted t0 8&Prime; for ths). Algo added are&rsquo; 3 new Types of pad and rotated

<p>
&lsquo;Wel those are the good points
</p>
<p>
Tm sfesid 1 have to say there are several things 1 would want done differently. These relate
mostly 10 the methods weed a orplemeat Ihe provements
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the extended size capability Because the SVC display is too small it is obviously
ccs 1 fv ony seca the, boar duped st atte a ead we work
&lsquo;omg done.&rdquo; The system wed. dies the board nto oughly 3 aches square At aay one
time, there wilt be one &lsquo;of there&rsquo;on the screen and the othere ect vaible. Unfortanatey the
boundanes are fsed tnd there ts ao. owl &lsquo;The revit &amp; that there sf &ldquo;aoughls and roses
Surf, most unosae ht which e_impouible to se clearly Anyone who bat ted
anganng. scrote the boondary non-overlapping, maps wihout being able To sce both at once
&lsquo;ellinow bow teky tris TR souion would be Yalow aay secon&rsquo; (or at least be of 16 oF
TBoce cverlaping seco) 1 be duplayed.
</p>
<p>
To make this worse, the boundary zones cannot be crossed by tracks 20 you have (0 fad the
point and define (wo (aeks&rdquo; Ths process is painful and oa the demo. PCB ile it bas
&lsquo;obviously enuted tome confusion atone point
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The double sided facility 4 also bound to cause problems with the two colour (on / off)
display &ldquo;This has been done by displaying ove. side or the other but not both. This makes sense but
Without the facility to display both sides simultaneously (at least temporarily) it is still-quite
