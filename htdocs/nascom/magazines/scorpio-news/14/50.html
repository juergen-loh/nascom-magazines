<p>
2 The parameters from CONFIGSYS are read into the DPBs for user configured drives (D- to L: ia
say case)
</p>
<p>
3. When any disk is logged in (even to be formatted), it x checked for density of recording (if
any preset)

<p>
4 The ve is also checked by dng line 2 of the oppy bus mio the high density state and
W360 RPM. i detected on the SECTOR le the deve is deemed HD otherwise is double
(Ge normal these days) density,

5: MS-DOS deades wiuch type of dav it must be and places the appropriate parameters inthe DPB.

<p>
7 It follows from 6: that one cannot format a blank disk at normal densly on a high density
drive unless one can convince the system that its a normal densiy drive by some other means.
</p>
<p>
&amp; It follows from 3 that a 730K formatted disk can be written to on an HD drive and thal 3
previously formatted 730k dusk may be reformatied 730K.
