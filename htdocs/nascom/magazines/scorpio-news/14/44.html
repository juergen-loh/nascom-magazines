ruoumes, NOt a, problem for an, wu writing for humsel, but when it comes to
commercial use of either, Clipper is to be preferred as the end user doeiat have to pay anything
forthe licensing of the&rsquo; complers runtimes&rsquo; Mind jou, nether of these complert what jou
sight call cheap, Clipper comes to at about &pound;500, whist&rsquo; Foxbase doesn&rsquo; give you much change cut of
&pound;400, 59 you arent likely buy either for fun,

My Stateside contact had recently coafiaed Fosbase 10 the bun, as the disadvantages outweyged
the advantages.

1 koow very litle about Quicksiher Paul i pressing me for copy (1 said 1 woulda&rsquo; get
round to fishing this article before the copy deadline) and 1 shas&rsquo;t lay hands on Quicksilver
ntl ex week. &ldquo;Flom what radia the adverts there are two things ge for i Fs, aot
aly re. the database sarvctures &ldquo;compatible with DBI, but the indexes are compatble swell
(nth &ldquo;Gipper and &lsquo;Fosbase, the. databscs axe compatible, bat&rdquo; the souexes.areot), secondly, it has
TO commands the equivalent of BASICs INF and OUT satracdons Not a major pins perhaps exept
Mave seed of VO commands 17 something Tm dmg, and to be hooes, I al ad asembler patches

So that leaves us with Clipper As J said, Ive become numately savalved with Clipper over
the Inst year Whar can I sayr it does the job) compiles DBIM+ source with very litle
&lsquo;wcompatibity. Ok, 40. i&rsquo;s ot eatrely compatble, 1 have to Keep an mand that what Tm wriing
15 gouag fo end up compiled sa that some of the litle quirks are accounted for
</p>
<p>
Some of the incompaiilty of my vernon of Clipper appears to have some, about by Nantucket
boing a lle prenour &ldquo;it seems thal my version war writen around DBI and thea the desgners
Soa, Waal tbe tice ote th that a thee Sty Wet ahead ad ed
ome tice bi iluding&rsquo;wondonang wing atid the ality to detect what paca key Was
&lsquo;ed to ext fom 2 GET statement All wonhwdie eancements of DBI
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Ashion Tate also thought these would be &amp; good idea and wcluded them un DBIIL+
but, you guessed it, they work slightly differently! The teal killer of that buach is the ability
to eur the key press on &lsquo;eit ffom a GET, un Clipper the function is called LASTKEY() wl in
Dplil+ irs called &lsquo;READKEY(_ and. returs t aumber &ldquo;Worse, the same. key fetus &lsquo;3 ffereat
&lsquo;umber for either dBIi + or Clipper wich more keys effective ia DBMT-, ths has resulted in me
&lsquo;writing a trapsiation table to sort it all out, messy and takes up space, but it does allow all
ors of things which Would achernee be posible,
</p>
<p>
On the score of returning ey presses, another ancompatbity is the way INKEY() returns the
function keye between DBI and Clipper Now any ordinary tey is Ok, the valve returned by INKEYO
ie the charucer value of the key prewed, Bul function Keys work dillerenly, wothin DOS, minum
two bytecode. returned for function keys, the first byte being the key&rsquo; aumber, indicating it&rsquo;s a
Function key, and the second and subsequent bytes being the function key stng.

<p>
DBIN+ koows. ths and seads the second bye cortety retuamg the fist character of what

All tis sounds tke bad sews (om the programming port of view, but there are several wa
round it, the nevtest ts thal Nantucket eatcypeed thet might happes so they have included te
&lsquo;Gipper&rsquo;&lsquo;sanatle. &ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s PUBLIC vanble hat been deca i takes&rdquo; the dalagpe logical
Soil wied aot ony thay ots ahvaje declared fae, bath&rdquo; by &lsquo;DBIIL+ and. Clipper Se Clipper
looks at the PUBLIC declarations when compding, and&rsquo; if u comes! areis a PUBLIC. cll &lsquo;Clipper i
