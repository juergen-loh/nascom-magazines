&lsquo;The 19M card (and 1 guess the others) bas some simple and stupid dedicated hardware features
&lsquo;The major houlie two sepur latches, ome which says &ldquo;RD track/ad track&rdquo; which relates philly
tovthe &lsquo;deve selected and the other which says. &ldquo;HighiNocmal &ldquo;deasty&rdquo;&rdquo; This could gre &ldquo;us four
permutations which should cover the three cases we want and one we don
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, when &ldquo;BO track&rdquo; is selected, 1 jams the other Iateh so that it&rsquo;s automatically
high density 20 any drive assigned wut 80 tacks is automatically assumed to be high density
Alto, the head step hardware always sends two ead-step pulses to the dive but in the. case of @
SHigh density&rdquo; being selected a hardware &lsquo;divide 2 divider is userted sm the head-step line to
casure one sep per tack if an") track&rdquo; drive is selected &ldquo;and &ldquo;Normal &ldquo;densty&rdquo; ss&rdquo; asserted
thea the dimder switched out to provide 4 tracks og the 80 ack dnve, and the data rale
&lsquo;witches to 250K &lsquo;bits Thos formating a 360K disk. This explaine my nding of 2 normal BD
track drive double stepping, desde beg an 80 track deve and running normal density

<p>
If &ldquo;40 track&rdquo; as selected, then
operation.

&lsquo;That iso the end of the story, Ive since discovered acontroller card which claims to sob
the problem, although T haven&rsquo;t tried it (im aot spending tore &lsquo;money on something I&rsquo;m prepared {0
Five With, libough Td ather not Lve with i that is). &ldquo;The card is the &ldquo;UDC card) from UPIC
of Dunst
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The story &amp; continued by John and what follows is an edited vernon of long Heiter which T
recewed i the mde of July. Il appears to get round the &lsquo;problem wih one_particlar eoatroller
(Everest) and throws some beginers light on to some ofthe otber pecliar aspects of MS-DOS.
</p>
<p>
jams the &ldquo;Density&rdquo; latch to low and forces normal 360K

John Parrott Continues

<p>
&lsquo;There are many IBM&nbsp;XTs and ATs at the company where I wed to work and the word was that 360k
&lsquo;disks wnilen on the high densty drives were aotonousy unreliable&rdquo; Of &lsquo;course that made some
fense to me, Knowing that the diference in the bead areas docs cause 4 reduction ia the signal 10
foie ratio whens stp. recording 1 played ack on 4 Sip drive, because of the unr &lsquo;areas
(or even worse, unerased &lsquo;6ipr trac) &ldquo;seen&rdquo; by the 48ipr heads,&rdquo; But havng said that, 1 bave (0
&lsquo;ay that wl the Gemuni one could get away with almost anything most of the time. Amway, the
fomputer sernces people were therefore equipping their ATs wih 60K &ldquo;48 drives so. that dike
ould be shared around the company
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The time came for me to buy an AT (wy, how and which are another story) and the ation of =
