PSH is the physical record shift factor and i described by Digital Research at bemg

&lsquo;PHM is the physical record mask and calculated to be (physical sector sz/128)-1.

PSH and PHM are used sn exactly the same way as BLM sod BSH except that istead of converting
(CPNA records and extets to block mumbers, they are now converting CP/M. records to physical sector
