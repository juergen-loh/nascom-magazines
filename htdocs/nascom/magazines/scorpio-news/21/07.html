1 also have to use, from time to time, an IBM&nbsp;XT and, on the whole, I see no good
reason to abandon my trusty Nascom, (in which I am personally familiar with almost

modifications) in favour of this box of tricks....although I must admit that the IBM
is prettier to look at! Given the required control of the Bios, the Nascom based
8-bit CP/M will continue to meet most of my needs for several more years yet, and
I repeatedly recognise how lucky I was when, in almost total ignorance about 6 years
ago, I chose the basic Nascom&nbsp;2 kit in preference to the many alternatives available
at that time.
