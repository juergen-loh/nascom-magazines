defeated by a stupid computer! If there is anyone else out there with a similar
interest who would like to collaborate with me (or who has already done it) I would

Incidentally the desired changes which originally prompted all this work were
associated with the introduction of:&ndash;
</p>
<ol class="paranthesiss indent2">
<li>additional disk drives for 8&Prime; (possibly also 3.5&Prime; and 3&Prime;)</li>
<li>additional memory (beyond 64K)</li>
<li>virtual disk</li>
</ol>

but, as Clive Bowden indicates in his fourth paragraph on page&nbsp;51, above all I want
to feel that I have control of this aspect of my system and can then adapt it as
required in the future.

I also have to use, from time to time, an IBM&nbsp;XT and, on the whole, I see no good
reason to abandon my trusty Nascom, (in which I am personally familiar with almost
every individual component and soldered joint, many of which are my own
modifications) in favour of this box of tricks....<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>although I must admit that the IBM
is prettier to look at! Given the required control of the Bios, the Nascom based
8-bit CP/M will continue to meet most of my needs for several more years yet, and
I repeatedly recognise how lucky I was when, in almost total ignorance about 6 years
ago, I chose the basic Nascom&nbsp;2 kit in preference to the many alternatives available
at that time.
