forms, then anyone typing A4: would succeed in entering JOHN:, since Z3 does not
check to see if there is a password associated with a DU before granting access.
</p>
<p>
The modified code listed in Appendix &lsquo;A&rsquo; will cause the Z3 CCP to check DU forms
as well as DIR forms for password protection. Space is a problem in the Z3 CCP.
Not all routines in the CCP are available in the RCP segment, and some perform
slightly differently. In order to get the modified code into the CCP, I had to reduce
the number of CCP commands to just ERA, GET and SAVE. The ZCPR3 RCP
however has room to give me all of the remaining commands that I need.
</p>
<p>
The ZCPR3 source code is written in 8080 mnemonics. Some Z80 specific code is
used in the CCP segment, but this is generated by the use of Macros. It is possible
to save a useful number of bytes in this code by adopting more standard Z80
operations, This task is made easier if the source is translated to Z80 with a program
like XLATE3.COM. I have found some dozen extra bytes without really trying too
hard, and there are probably more that could be saved.
</p>
<p>
By modifying the ZCPR3.ASM file as described and re-assembling, then the Z3
CCP will check both DU: and DIR: forms of address for passwords before granting
access.

Using the SVC Alternative Screen as a Command List
</h2>
<p>
Some time ago I described in 80-BUS News how I had modified my BIOS so that
a lead in key (^T) provided access to a number of single key operations, From
relatively simple beginnings, this direct command feature grew into an extremely
useful tool. For example a ^P would page the Printer and BIOS, ^S would toggle
the screen paging, ^D would do a screen dump, and several keys would alter lines
per page, skip-over, change the printer type, etc. In more recent versions, it was
possible to strike ^F as the second key, and this would switch

screens. This
appeared to me to be an attractive operation, but subsequently I never found much
use for it.
</p>
<p>
In the version described in a previous 80-BUS News, when ^T was hit, a prompt
line appeared on the top line of the screen, reminding the user of the option keys
available. The main problem with this was to remember which key did what
operation since they were not all functionally related and there was not enough
space on the top line to display the detail needed.
</p>
<p>
Recently, whilst setting up a Z3 startup menu, it occurred to me that it would be
extremely useful if entry of a ^T key switched to screen 2 of the SVC, on which
could be displayed a full list of the second key options then available. After the
