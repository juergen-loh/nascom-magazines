Perhaps the most universally
used is Peter Norton&rsquo;s SI
(System Information) program
which sits and chugs for a
moment or two and finally spits
out a &lsquo;goodness&rsquo; number relative
to a bog standard IBM&nbsp;PC at 4.77
MHz. A 6MHz IBM&nbsp;AT with
one wait state clocks in at about
8.5, my toy shows up at 11.5 and
so on. The latest version of SI
goes on to test the relative
goodness of the hard disk as well
(which can be very revealing).

I&rsquo;ve just done that, seems a bit
slow today, perhaps the recent
inclusion of <span class="uppercase">Ndosedit</span> has
slowed the keyboard interrupt
up a bit anyway she still performs
adequately.

Another program for coming up
with a relative performance
index is SPEED by Landmark,
there&rsquo;s is simple, to the point and
gives a graphical display like a
thermometer. It&rsquo;s not as good as
SI for telling you whats going on
in the computer but its ideal for
my ball park speed figure and
pretty too, impresses the
customers.

The best for really putting the
CPU through the hoops is the
Microdesigns Performance
Analyser but it&rsquo;s results are
difficult to interpret. But it does
show BUS hang-ups and all
sorts of strange goings on.<br><br>
