WordStar 4 for CP/M-80

In the last issue of Scorpio News I wrote a
<a href="../../../14/52/text/#article1">brief review of WordStar 4</a>,
and ended
it by saying that I felt it unlikely that WordStar 4 would find its way to CP/M. Well,
you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that I was wrong, and also that MicroPro are offering an
upgrade service from your current WordStar to WS4 for CP/M-80 for c.&pound;135.
