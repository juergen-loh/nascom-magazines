enabled me to check that I could read the disks. The next stage was to write a new
BIOS to use the disks properly. I decided to keep my existing QDDS drives for
booting the system and to use the new drives without system tracks. The disk
parameter block was therefore defined thus:&ndash;

These parameters are described in M W T Waters&rsquo; article in Scorpio News Volume&nbsp;1
<a href="../text/#article1"></a>Issue&nbsp;4, and I will not go into them more fully here, except to note that the last two
are relevant only to CP/M&nbsp;3.x systems, and to point out that I decided to keep the
4k block size used in the QDDS system, but to double the directory size to 256
entries. I have never run into problems with directory overflow with the QDDS
format, and I expect to have a preponderance of large files on these disks.

Those who are familiar with the SYS BIOSs will be aware that the sector read and
write routines are given track and sector requests in registers D and E respectively.
The low level routines deal with the arithmetic necessary for side selection. With
track numbers running from 0 to 319 two bytes are necessary, and CP/M&nbsp;2.2 and 3.1
already make requests for track and sector using two bytes. All that was necessary
therefore was to arrange for the calling routine (that previous passed track in D and
sector in E) to store two bytes for track and two bytes for sector in RAM for the
low level routine, which I adjusted accordingly. A minor modification to the disk
error routine to deal with track numbers greater than 255 completed the
adjustments.

Full of confidence, I now attached the second drive and powered up. It was obvious
that the Gemini FDC power supply was inadequate for the purpose, because the
new drives crashed whenever there were two connected at once, and a high capacity
switch mode supply was obtained at very reasonable cost from Henry&rsquo;s Radio.
