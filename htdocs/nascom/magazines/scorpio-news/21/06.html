very well while Quickbasic comes in two versions, and you use the one appropriate
to your system. Their list prices are &pound;70 and &pound;85 (+ VAT) but Digitask (____ _____)
are offering them at &pound;47 and &pound;67. The best thing about these BASICs is the fact that
they are compilers with excellent screen-editing facilities. They really make MS
Basic under CP/M look positively antique. If you are looking for a good,
well-featured alternative to Basic-2 at a price which won&rsquo;t bankrupt, go for
Turbo-Basic.

Prospero have recently introduced MSDOS versions of <span class="uppercase">Pascal</span> and
<span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>-77 with GEM bindings at round about &pound;100. You get quite a lot for
your money but it is worth shopping around&nbsp;&ndash; try Grey Matter at Ashburton &mdash;
they often have quite substantial discounts and very fast delivery. I didn&rsquo;t like GEM
very much at first but, when trying out the Fortran version, found it to be quite
friendly&nbsp;&ndash; much more so than ****** MSDOS!

<h2>
User friendly CP/M with a Nascom system
</h2>
<p>
Clive Bowden&rsquo;s very interesting article on
&ldquo;<a href="../../../11/51/text/#article1">Making CP/M more User-Friendly</a>
(Scorpio News, Jan-March 1987) mentions that he has no knowledge of the Nascom
<span class="small-caps">Bios</span>.
I have been using their Version 2.1 of CP/M&nbsp;2.2 for several years, in
conjunction with their
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
board and
<span class="small-caps">Avctext</span> terminal software, and have found
it very satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
However, I recently wanted to make some changes to it.....! Being an ex-electronic
design engineer in my early 60&rsquo;s I am more &ldquo;at home&rdquo; with hardware than software
but, having acquired at least some ability in this over the past few years, I decided
to &ldquo;have a go&rdquo;. Nascom (Lucas Logic) would not supply the source code for their
<span class="small-caps">Bios</span> or
<span class="small-caps">Avctext</span> so I dis-assembled the
<span class="small-caps">Bios</span> and managed to identify a few of
the ares of interest to me. Half of it is in ROM so I devised a simple hardware
modification which enables me to switch out the ROM and operate entirely in RAM
after the initial booting. (I haven&rsquo;t yet found a way of putting it all neatly on the disk
system tracks, but don&rsquo;t regard this as a high priority at this stage.)
</p>
<p>
Without the original source it is still very difficult to make major modifications so I
have tried to adapt a version of SYS (Version 16.0 for a Gemini system) for which
I happened to have the source. This has proved very difficult, and I am not yet sure
why, but having half the original
<span class="small-caps">Bios</span>
at D600h and the other half at F000h certainly doesn&rsquo;t help!
</p>
<p>
This project has been dormant for quite a while now, but I intend to spend some
more effort on it, partly because I want the results but also because I don&rsquo;t like being
