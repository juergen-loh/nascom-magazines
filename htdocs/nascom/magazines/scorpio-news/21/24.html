that itself asked &lsquo;W/w&rsquo;, and which on exit asked:
&ldquo;BACKUP DONE &ndash; PROCEED (with original command)?".
</p>
<p>
I have now completely changed the system of command access. The philosophy now
is that any command that can cause a disk operation, cursor movement, printer
output or change the printer or screen format is protected in some way.
</p>
<p>
All lower case (a-z) commands, except &ldquo;f&rdquo;, are converted to upper case, allowing
great shortening of the dispatch table code. Protection is applied to ALL A-Z
commands EXCEPT 1,J,M,D,F,f,V. (M,D,F,f require parameters anyway, so they
can be aborted, and I,J and V commands do not cause serious problems if invoked
in error.)
</p>
<p>
The remaining A &mdash;Z commands can have unwanted results if accessed in error, so
they are ALL accessed via a lead-in key. I have chosen &lsquo;- Q&rsquo; for this purpose, since
it was not used as a command, and &lsquo;Q&rsquo; is near the control key. A small amount of
extra code has been added which has widened the scope of this, so that a total of
four key sequences are available to access the required protected commands. e.g.;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;QE or &ldquo;Qe or *Q*E or *Q&ldquo;%e keys will ALL access the &lsquo;E&rsquo; command.
</p>
<p>
Where the command in question can have particularly awkward results, such as &lsquo;E&rsquo;,
&lsquo;W&rsquo;, &lsquo;K&rsquo; etc.;, a further prompt is printed for security. Since most of these extra
security keys are only used a few times in a session, this double protection is not a
problem.
</p>
<p>
In some cases like formatting, the &ldquo;Q protected command requests extra
parameters, and so this request provides a way of escape, without the need for
GEMPEN to ask if it is safe to proceed.

<h4>
Modifications to Commands.
</h4>
<p>
a) F/f &ndash; Find and Replace
</p>
<ol>
<li>^X during string input will abort command without cursor moving.
Originally once a string was started there was no way to abort, and &ndash; Z. would
cause the cursor to move to some other place which depended on what had
been entered.</li>
<li>Find and Replacement Strings now allow&nbsp;? wildcard Characters. (Advisable
not to use&nbsp;?&rsquo;s in replacement string since they will be left in the text.)</li>
