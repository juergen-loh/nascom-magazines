This interesting piece of software came my way as a result of an enquiry to our august
editor about CAD packages for the 80-BUS range. I had seen and used some of
the packages available for the BBC and PC market and wondered if there had been
any developments from the program that Scorpio had offered last year. I hadn&rsquo;t
come across any Folly Bidden software before (an unusual name which even in my
usual absent-minded state, I would have remembered!)
</p>
<p>
It came, a little before Christmas, with the request that a review be done as soon as
possible.... So here goes.
</p>
<p>
The software is presented as a single 80 track QDDS disc with a 23 page manual
which, in the review copy, was done on a dot-matrix printer. The manual is well-laid
out, with a good table of contents which should prove adequate for most users.

System requirements
</h2>
<p>
This package requires the Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM832"); ?>
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
(video controller card) and the
program aborts if it is run on a system which includes the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 VFC","MAP80 Video-Floppy card",""); ?>.
I couldn&rsquo;t test it with the Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM812"); ?>
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
owing to lack of time but I
suspect that problems might arise. <i>[Ed. &ndash; yes, as the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
does not have a graphics
mode.]</i> As supplied, the package requires CP/M-80 version 2.0 or higher, and
should work with Nascom&nbsp;2, Gemini (Z80) and MAP CPUs. Memory requirements
are modest, with 44k quoted as &ldquo;plenty&rdquo;. Hard copy can be produced using a
dot-matrix printer with graphic dump facility &ndash; more or less any Epson RX
compatible printer (Canon, Panasonic etc.) will work satisfactorily. For those lucky
people with access to an X-Y plotter, a much higher quality copy will be produced.
Suitable dump routines are provided on the disk. The recommended maximum size
for the design is 8&Prime; square but in fact, larger boards could be produced in sections
and the author states that it is capable of producing double-sided boards of almost
unlimited size. From a perusal of the instruction manual, I gathered that the
hard-copy output was at a 1:1 scale.
</p>
<p>
I used a used a fairly standard Gemini Multi-board system which included the SVC
and produced dumps using a Panasonic KX-P1082 printer. I was unable to check
the claims for the plotter output since the only X-Y plotter to which I had access
