Lastly, is my favourite for upsetting people who think their disk drives actually
perform to the manufacturers spec. I haven&rsquo;t found a drive yet which will actually
do what the spec says. <span class="uppercase">Coretest</span> by Core International only works on hard disks
but it&rsquo;s fun and you can really hear the disk drive working as it does its thing.

Armed with these programs, I can walk into a customers premises and sit down in
front of a brand X computer and get a very thorough idea of what the thing capable
of, and get my ball park figures for the timing within minutes. The programs are
also fun when trotting round a computer manufacturer&rsquo;s facility. Just pop a disk in
the hole, run a couple of tests, nod sadly and say, &ldquo;Hmmm, I thought so.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s very
effective on persistent &lsquo;know-nothing&rsquo; salesmen who immediately say they&rsquo;ll go and
find someone technical for me to talk to. Come to think of it, I&rsquo;ll try it on that national
High Street photographic and computer store, you know the one &ndash; the one where
Jasper Carrot reckons the staff have a combined IQ of 4. Should produce some
interesting results.

Still I think I&rsquo;d better stop here. I&rsquo;ll visit Paul this evening and give him a disk with
this on it. It should take him a while to sort out the screen dumps!!
