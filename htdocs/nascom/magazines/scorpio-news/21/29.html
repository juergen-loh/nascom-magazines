second key was struck, the system switched to the first screen again and carried out
the command.
</p>
<p>
I have modified the software to enable this. On system cold boot, the embedded
command in the Z3 multiple command line buffer is:
</p>
<p>
SAK;^C for system, saving TPA. Other keys load Help and Menus;<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CSET;<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SWSCR;<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TYPE
TKEYS.TXT;<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SWSCR;<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SETUP
</p>
<p>
In turn, this allows the user to go direct to the system (in case of reboot of a crashed
system where a SAVE is needed), or loads a preferred character set to the SVC,
Switches to Screen two, Types the ^T command menu, switches back to screen
one, loads a system set-up menu, (SETUP.COM is MENU.COM, renamed and
modified to load a file named START.MNU.)
</p>
<p>
When the user types ^T, code in the BIOS keyboard routine detects this and calls
code within the BIOS similar to that in SWSCR.COM to switch screens, thus
presenting the user with a more descriptive display of the options available. After
the second key control key has been entered, the BIOS switches back to SVC screen
one, and processes the command.

Multi-Operating System Data Corruption Problem
</h2>
<p>
Despite my preference for ZCPR3 as a much more powerful and friendly operating
system, it is sometimes necessary to use some other system. At work, MAP80 CP/M
Plus is available, together with a suite of MAP80 programs that allows reading,
writing and formatting of a large number of disk formats including CP/M, BBC, and
MSDOS. This suite needs CP/M Plus to run, and so I have a version of CP/M Plus
set up that will access the Winchester, as well as several floppy formats. Recently I
was asked to transfer a large number of files from a &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; CP/M format (ICL)
to IBMPC format. Since I could not do this directly between the floppies, I had to
read the files on to an unused DU: on the Winchester, and then to load a special
MSDOS transfer program to write the files to the MSDOS disks. This exercise was
completed without problem. On completion the ICL files were ERAsed from the
Winchester.

The ZCPR3 system allows access to USER areas up to 31 inclusive, instead of 15
as with CP/M. The ZCPR3 installation notes suggest that the HLP (system HELP)
files are held in USER 16. The HELP.COM file supplied with ZCPR3 will find
these files, and by putting them in USER 16 they are out of the way and will not
interfere with normal directory displays. Recently I tried to use some of the 500k
odd bytes of ZCPR3 .HLP files that reside on the Winchester and I found them
