Volume 1, Issue 4 at the end of September. This produced a minimal response, and
so valuable subscription funds were used to send out a further reminder in
mid-December. As I write this re-subscriptions are still coming in every couple of
days. The difficulty that this causes is in not knowing how many newsletters to have
printed, and if we had gone to the printers in December, as we did with Vol.1 Issue
1, then we would have definitely had too few printed. Even nowit is difficult to tell.
Isn&rsquo;t life fun!

Now, I also have to confess that this issue is probably a bit on the skinny side. &ldquo;Why
is that?&rdquo;, you ask. Well, for one, Scorpio News, like its predecessors, largely depends
upon the FREE supply of suitable material from you, our readers. We&rsquo;ve no idea
what has happened, but we have received virtually nothing this time round.
(Probably because we hadn&rsquo;t published the issue dates??!!) Secondly, producing
Scorpio News, fun that it is, does absolutely nothing to help our poor depleted bank
balance, and so we have been exceedingly busy on other projects. Next, we have to
get this out in a hurry before you all &lsquo;phone up and say &ldquo;where is it&rdquo;, and we haven&rsquo;t
time to write 30 pages ourselves. And finally, because we have used the amazing
Xerox Ventura Publisher to produce this issue, the same amount of material fits
onto far less pages. So here it is, rather thin, but with the promise that the next one
will be somewhat thicker if YOU&rsquo;Il send in a letter or article.

Disks and articles
</h2>
<p>
We still have a couple of disks that people sent us articles in on. Sorry that we haven&rsquo;t
returned them to you yet, but we&rsquo;ll endeavour to do so once we&rsquo;ve got this issue out.
Despite the paragraph above we DO still have one or two articles in hand that we
could publish, but they require various drawings/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>diagrams etc. associated with
them, and we haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to produce those yet.

<h2>
COMPEC
</h2>
<p>
Did anyone make it to Compec? What a waste of time! It seems to have totally lost
direction, and it was very difficult to work out who on earth it was aimed at. Once
upon a time it was THE computer show, and anybody and everybody who was
anybody or hoped to be somebody used to be there. For some time it has been the
ONLY show that Gemini has attended.
</p>
<p>
Well, Compec &rsquo;87 was, in my opinion, a wash-out. As I wandered round trying to
find certain companies&rsquo; stands, I realised that they weren&rsquo;t there. And as I started
to think about it I realised that virtually none of the major hardware or software
companies were there. So there is little to report about Compec &rsquo;87. What will
happen at Compec &rsquo;88? I, for one, doubt that I will be going there to find out.
