Dear Sir
</p>
<p>
Here is also a letter from Breda, the Netherlands. In brief the description of my
Gemini computer system. 19&Prime; Vero frame with 8 slots motherboard, in deep (40 cm)
19&Prime; case, 5U high. The boards are
<?php externalLink("GM811","",""); ?>,
<?php externalLink("GM802","",""); ?>,
<?php externalLink("GM802"); ?>
(drive M:&gt;),
<?php externalLink("GM832","",""); ?>,
<?php externalLink("GM829","",""); ?>,
Arfon lightpen! The keyboard is
<?php externalLink("GM827"); ?>
with 87 keys. The drives are 2 x
Teac FD55-F. The PSU is GM843. Printer: Citizen 120-D. Software is e.g.:
Graphpac, Gempen VG:1.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m using Gempen for letters, stamp collection, LP collection and so on. In text I
always use the &lt;ESCAPE&gt;s and &lt;cntrl&gt;s for the printer&rsquo;s character-set. I found
out it was possible to control the printer, in the Gempen manual there was (is) a
lack about it. (Manual Graphpac &gt;&gt;&gt; FILL&nbsp;?). The cursor is flickering instead
of blinking, how can I alter that? I am not a great programmer, but I&rsquo;am a hobbyist.
And that&rsquo;s why I ask for a little program for the &lt;lightpen&nbsp;&ndash; GM832&gt; in MBASIC.
</p>
<p>
In early times I had a Nascom&nbsp;1 with
<?php externalLink("RAM&nbsp;A","",""); ?>.
The story is well known. I learned
many things with it..... Then I saw Gemini. Many, many years later the Scorpio News
came and I was happy again&hellip;
</p>
<p>
Something about IBM (&hellip;): I do not like IBM at all and all that kind of things like
those IBMs and clones.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, G.C.M. Vissers, Breda, The Netherlands.

A ta party, the Real Programmers are in the corner talking about operating system
security and how to get around it. At a football game, the Real Programmer is the
one comparing the plays against his simulations printed on 11&Prime; by 14&Prime; fanfold paper.
At the beach, the Real Programmer is the one drawing flowcharts in the sand.
