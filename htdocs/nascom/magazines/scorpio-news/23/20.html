The quality of PD software is extremely variable and the majority of the vendors
haven&rsquo;t much idea either. So-called &lsquo;clubs&rsquo; offer discounts for quantity but little else.
Having been caught out by one or two of these organisations, I felt that it might be
useful to give a few names and addresses of firms and user groups which I have
found to be reliable:
</p>
<p>
<b>Shareware</b>, __ ____ ______, Tonbridge, Kent (____ ______).<br>
Advertise widely; useful booklet for &pound;1 in stamps listing all their PD and Shareware
MSDOS programs with ratings and compatibility.
</p>
<p>
<b>Seltec Computer Products Ltd.</b>, Farley Hall, _________ ____, Bracknell, Berks
____ ___ (____ ______).<br>
Widely advertised, but generally more expensive than the previous firm. No
guarantee given that software will run on your system but most will run on IBM or
near compatibles. I believe that they used to and may still offer some CP/M software.
</p>
<p>
Some of the other PD Software houses may be OK&nbsp;&ndash; but I haven&rsquo;t tried all of them
&ndash; there seem to be dozens.
</p>
<p>
<b>PC Independent User Group</b> (____ _____) mainly for Amstradophiles but offer all
(or nearly all) PC public domain software at &pound;3&nbsp;&ndash; &pound;4 per disk; very useful organisation
but costs &pound;22 per year to belong. They do offer many disks of useful software which
has been tested and does work on Amstrad and similar PCs)&nbsp;&ndash; and offer a useful
help line service as well.
</p>
<p>
For completeness, I ought to add the <b>IBM&nbsp;PC User Group</b> (__ ___ ____), although
I don&rsquo;t belong to it (it costs &pound;25 per year and a &pound;5 joining fee), and what used to be
called the <b>CP/M User Group</b> (____ _____). This organisation caters for MSDOS as
well as CP/M users and was excellent. I used to belong to it but regretfully decided
not to renew my subscription when they suddenly stopped producing informative
journals/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>newsletters/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>library catalogues last year. Members have access to virtually
all PD software which is commonly available for a copying charge of &pound;2.30 or so per
disk (send your own formatted disks) but you will need to know which library and
disk numbers you need. Both CP/M and MSDOS libraries are available and CP/M
disks can be produced in a variety of formats.
</p>
<p>
It might be useful to see if your potential source of software issues a catalogue
(printed or on disk). I was impressed by the <b>Shareware</b> booklet and I understand
that their bulletin board (____ ______) is quite useful.
