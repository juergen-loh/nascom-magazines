The third item of hardware required, is some means of powering the beast. When
a winchester is started, the motor draws a large amount of current from the +12v
supply. In addition both the winnie &amp; Controller card guzzle amps from the +5v
supply. Typically amperages are shown below:
</p>
<table class="winchester-comtroller">
<tr><td></td><td>Winchester:</td><td>Controller:</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Rodime 200 Series</td><td>Xebec S1410</td></tr>
<tr><td>+12V</td><td>4.0&nbsp;amps at start,<br>reducing to 66&nbsp;mA<br>(max)</td><td>2.4&nbsp;amps (max) after<br>30secs</td></tr>
<tr><td>+5V</td><td>0.65&nbsp;amps (max)</td><td>2.5&nbsp;amps (max)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In addition there is the rest of the system to power. As a general rule of thumb
something like a 100w supply is needed. However the later Gemini GM817&rsquo;s (85w)
are able to supply high amperages for a short while and will run a winnie system
quite happily.
</p>
<p>
Last, and certainly not least is the software. How do you tell your CP/M
implementation about the winnie. Well let&rsquo;s deal with Gemini CP/M&nbsp;2.2 users first.
It will be necessary to acquire a new CP/M with a winnie BIOS. Gemini can no doubt
supply an upgrade if you return your Master disk. The later Gemini CP/M&rsquo;s BIOS
3.3 for example have a SYSTEM.CFG file which is edited to indicate the type of
winchester and what configuration is required. It will as far as I understand only
cope with Rodime 200 Series drives, and some NEC and Miniscribe drives, so this
limits your winchester options. The Gemini winchester CP/M does have a nice
feature in allowing you to Boot direct from the winchester.
</p>
<p>
If you are running a MAP-80 CP/M&nbsp;2.2 or CP/M&nbsp;3.0, no further purchases are
necessary, you may merely edit your BIOS files and place details of your particular
winchester into them, then re-assemble and generate a new system. Apart from
saving some cash, the MAP route has another advantage in that most any type of
winchester can be catered for. If you need to upgrade your CP/M to cope with the
winchester a phone call to. MAP-80 might be worth your while.
</p>
<h2>
Putting it all together
</h2>
<p>
Apart from arranging the winnie &amp; controller&rsquo;s place in the card board box, the rest
is all down to links &amp; cabling. I shall assume you have manuals for your CP/M and
Floppy/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SASI card, it&rsquo;s useful to have one for the winnie, and not really essential for
the Xebec controller.
