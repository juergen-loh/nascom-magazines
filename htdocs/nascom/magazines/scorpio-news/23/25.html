Well, that&rsquo;s about it. Looks like there was more to say than I expected; even if every
bit offended someone different. Now, how can I get it to <b>Scorpio News</b>? My system
supports nearly two hundred disk formats courtesy of Uniform, but I don&rsquo;t even
bother to look for Gemini ... it won&rsquo;t be there. And that&rsquo;s a cue for another whinge.
How come there are so many formats? Multiplying the disk sizes (4) by the possible
sides (2) and densities (2) and numbers of tracks (2) gives a number not unadjacent
to 32. What spirit of perversity causes every different manufacturer to select their
own unique format? Pride, I suppose. If anyone knows whether the Gemini format
matches any computer ever sold in America, I&rsquo;d be most grateful for the
information. For now I&rsquo;ll send this in on an IBM 360k PC disk, which is as standard
as a 3/16 UNF bolt.
