prototype? It certainly looks old and dirty enough. You should be ashamed, and so
should Gemini who sold it for the full price.

Help Wanted

<p>
Having mentioned Gemini, there is also their retail arm, Quantum, and I have
something to say about them too. While I cannot complain about their standard of
service, I must point out that I pay a lot for it. In spite of transferring five-figure sums
to their bank account I still have to pay retail prices. Is there any dealer who&rsquo;d like
to take over this business in exchange for 30-day credit and a modest trade discount?
This year I&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;loads-a-money&rdquo; to spend and I&rsquo;m totally corrupt.

New Pluto Review-ette
</h2>
<p>
The new Plutos have arrived at last! The first thing I noticed is that the user manual
is dated 1986, and the cards have &ldquo;1988&rdquo; etched into the metal. I expect that&rsquo;s why
they have so many undocumented links and features. Still, they work; a process of
elimination revealed that the extra six pins on the TTL video connector carry only
the new brightness line, and can be ignored in my application. It&rsquo;s a good job I never
used the 50-pin header because it&rsquo;s gone without trace.

A very nice board, altogether. It has no less than five layers of metal and ninety(!)
ICs including for the first time a serial interface (undocumented) and space for a
palette DAC. The silk screen now carries the legend
<span class="small-caps">&ldquo;gemini computer systems ltd.&rdquo;</span>
as well as the IO Research trademark, and joy of joys! a full set of 78 edge
fingers. So at last I can have a &ldquo;Ready&rdquo; interrupt, once I figure out where to patch it
on the board. But wait! what is this link marked &ldquo;INT&rdquo; connected to bus pin 22? I
don&rsquo;t know, because it is not mentioned anywhere in the manual. Neither is the DIL
switch, though fortunately here the silk screen gives some help. It apparently selects
serial baud rates, a diagnostic mode, palette on or off and the polarity of the sync
signals. A reset push button has been fitted, though the board still doesn&rsquo;t reset from
the bus, doubtless for very good reasons. Resetting the Pluto has always given me
problems. If the host system is turned off and on again quickly, Pluto hangs up. My
customers can&rsquo;t understand this, and I don&rsquo;t think they should have to, as it could
be cured by the addition of a single diode.

There&rsquo;s an extra 64k of memory on board, which implements the brightness attribute
as a fourth colour plane. This means you can have sixteen colours without a palette,
instead of the eight formerly available. Personally I don&rsquo;t find it that much of an
advantage, and I think most serious users will want the palette, but it&rsquo;s there if
needed. Tests with a stop-watch show that this extra plane slows things up, but not
by as much as expected. I am a bit mystified as to why the board is stuffed up with
64k RAM chips in these days of megabits, but I suspect it has to do-with availability.
So long as I get my cards on time I&rsquo;m not going to complain. The ROM has taken a
