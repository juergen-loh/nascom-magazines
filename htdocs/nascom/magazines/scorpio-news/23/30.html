and it then became possible to BOOT from the Winnie. CONFIG.SYS was also
edited to give the system 40 buffers, use ANSI.SYS, and set COUNTRY=44 for
the UK. AUTOEXEC.BAT was set to load the &lsquo;KEYBUK&rsquo; file in order to set-up
the keyboard for UK codes, and also to set a suitable DOS PROMPT. Subsequently,
other commands were added to AUTOEXEC.BAT in order to improve system
startup configuration.

Performance and Appraisal
</h2>
<p>
The News Release information describes three methods of configuring the 1Mb of
system RAM:
</p>
<p>
a) 0-512k, 1024-1536k<br>
b) 0-640k, 1024-1408k<br>
c) 0-1024k, to allow a RAM resident BIOS to be loaded.
</p>
<p>
I had assumed that the card would have been set for system b), since this would
appear to be the most &lsquo;normal&rsquo; arrangement, but in fact, attempts to set up a
RAM-disk in extended memory above 1024k failed, and I can only assume that the
RAM was currently set to system c) since the system provides 640k of standard
RAM. The software necessary to re-configure 12MHz systems was not available at
the time of this review, but will shortly be available. Gemini say that it is possible to
configure the system for non-valid parameters, and need to get the software right
before releasing it, which is a sound approach, but the inability to be able to
re-configure the system caused some problems due to inability to use spooler or
RAM.-disk facilities, except in system RAM.

<p>
The two versions of PCDOS tried ran without apparent problems, and I was also
able to try out a number of software packages on the machine, including a number
of more expensive commercial packages. All of the programs tried seemed to run
without problems at the full system speed. None of the programs tried relied on
timing in the way that certain games do, except possibly Chess. (I am not sure if the
game is completely tied to the system real time clock, or runs faster, and therefore
performs more evaluations in the allowed clock time, which would of course,
increase its power.)
</p>
<p>
I was not able to try &lsquo;Flight Simulator&rsquo; however, which I understand is a particularly
good test for compatibility. The commercial packages tried included Wordstar 3.41,
Supercalc 3, Xtree, Turbo Pascal, Turbo Basic, Microsoft Basic 5, Norton Utilities,
PCII Tools, Cyrus Chess, and Sidekick. A number of &lsquo;Free&rsquo; or &lsquo;Shareware&rsquo; programs
were also tried, without problems.

<p>
In addition to the standard 25 by 80 format, the EGA card used supported 43 lines
and 132 columns, and drivers were available for certain programs. Wordstar was
