<p>
I have had an opportunity to use one of these systems, and the notes that follow are
based on my impressions of the system after using one for several days and trying
various software packages out.
</p>
<p>
The system described was originally listed as the GM6102, but would now be very
similar to the GM6202. This system comprises an enclosure with a 12Mhz, 1Mb
system card, 44Mb 28ms Winnie, 1.2Mb floppy and Keyboard. A Taxan 770+
Multi-Sync Monitor and a Paradise Auto-Switch 480 EGA graphics card were used
in conjunction with the GM6102.

Hardware
</h2>
<p>
The system card is available in 8 and 12&nbsp;MHz versions, but the one fitted to the
system had the following specifications:&ndash;
</p>
<ul>
<li>12MHz 80286 CPU and 1Mb of 80 nano-second parity checked RAM, running
	without wait states.</li>
<li>Battery backed Real Time Clock.</li>
<li>101-key AT style keyboard, and AT compatible keyboard interface.</li>
<li>Phoenix BIOS.</li>
<li>6 expansion slots (two of them &lsquo;short&rsquo; slots).</li>
<li>Socket for a 80287 maths co-processor.</li>
<li>One serial and one parallel port.</li>
<li>A system EEPROM holding system default parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This card is a multi-layer card of very high quality, utilising pre-insertion tested
components. It is made in the UK, by British Aerospace, at Bristol.
</p>
<p>
The case is a very well screened-metal enclosure, and it is stated to conform to the
RFI requirements of BS6527. The PSU is separately screened, and appears to be a
very robust unit. It contains a fan, and provides two CEE22 mains outlets to power
auxiliaries such as monitors or printers. Judging by the photographs that appeared
in the
&lsquo;<?php externalLink("Personal Computer World","PCW",""); ?>&rsquo;,
at the time of their review of the <span class="uppercase">Challenger</span>, the case appears
to be virtually the same as is used for that machine. The front panel is of a moulded
construction, and apart from the Gemini logo, only displays a Power indicator, and
the Floppy drive(s).
</p>
<p>
A recessed area on the lower rear panel holds the parallel and serial port
connectors, keyboard socket, and makes provision for a Video O/P socket, should
a system card contain &lsquo;built-in&rsquo; graphics facilities. The rear left hand side of the case
provides access to the expansion slots, by removal of a narrow blanking plate for
each expansion card fitted. It is of course necessary to remove the enclosure
surround to fit expansion cards, or to access the system box. Since the enclosure is
secured by only four screws, this is not difficult.
