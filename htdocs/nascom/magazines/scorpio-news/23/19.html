Some readers will have made use of freely available, low cost software obtained from
</p>
<p>
user or special interest groups, or purchased through one or other of the firms which
advertise in the glossier magazines. In most cases, no guarantee is given that the
software which you have. purchased will rum on your particular machine and the
amount of information which is B available. in the. advertisements c or. r disk &laquo; contents
listings is inadequate. oe o, : ; :

<p>
Some of. this program material. is : toaly public &lsquo;domain &ndash; &ndash; donated i in a spirit of
generosity by:the author.and-available for the cost of a disk and a copying charge.
</p>
<p>
Other software isknown.as Shareware, and is either fully-functional: (but not always
the most:up-to-date version),or restricted in some way. To get the maximum benefit
from Shareware, you are usually invited to register by sending in an appropriate
amount of cash after trying it out. You will then receive an.updated or de-restricted
version and, in many cases, a detailed manual. In some cases, the author relies on
your good nature to send a donation if you like his/her program and intend.to use
it. Itis a sad fact. that&rsquo;some so-called: PD software distributors charge far more than
the copying and handling charge: but equally, one should be careful of so-called
low-cost offers since the quality of the disks can be poor and may damage your
drives. The majority of such PD software is for MSDOS although one or two sources
also offer CP/M programs.
