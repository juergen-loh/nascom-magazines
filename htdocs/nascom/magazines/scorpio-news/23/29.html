The general standard of construction is very high, and the unit is quite heavy.
Personally I prefer this, unless the unit is to be moved around a lot, since it makes
the machine less prone to knocks and bumps, and to external fields. The Fan, Floppy
and Winchester drive ran quite quietly, and the machine also felt quite cool, with
the air emanating from the fan being just slightly warm. As an Electronics Engineer
I have always preferred &lsquo;cool chips&rsquo;. The temperature at which some equipment
runs never ceases to amaze me. I have burnt my fingers on chips in some equipment,
and I wonder how long they are going to survive.
</p>
<p>
I would however have liked to have been able to have seen some minor alterations
such as:
</p>
<p>
a) A hardware &lsquo;Go slower&rsquo; switch, on the rear panel.<br>
b) Provision for bringing out drive connector cables at the rear. This may be
non-standard in compatibility terms, but it would allow temporary connection of
alternative drive types, to give ease of inter-format copying.<br>
c) A more easily removable second floppy panel cut-out.
</p>
<p>
These points are minor however, since it is possible to get software to make the
system run slower, or one can re-configure the EEPROM, and one can find ways
of bringing out a lead to connect an external drive &ndash; see below.

Software and Documentation
</h2>
<p>
Possibly because the system is a new product and things are not yet fully organised,
documentation and software was conspicuous by its absence. The only software
supplied was a disk with Hard Disk support, and a &lsquo;<span class="uppercase">Utilities</span>&rsquo; disk, with just ONE
program &ndash; SETUP.COM. Documentation consisted of three A4 sheets with brief
details of switch settings, I/O port addresses and connections. There was also a
manual on the Hard Disk unit. There was no information on the I/O devices used
and their programming in low level languages, nor on any other hardware. Most
important, there was no programme to allow user configuration of the system
defaults held in the EEPROM.
</p>
<p>
I understand that these problems will be rectified in the future.

<p>
Initially, MSDOS 3.2 was not available but I was able to &lsquo;borrow&rsquo; a copy of PCDOS
version 2, to start testing the system, and later a copy of PCDOS version 3.2, which
allowed me to format floppies correctly and to access the features of the system.
</p>
<p>
My first exercise was to format and partition the Hard Disk, and to edit
CONFIG.SYS to allow the Hard Disk to be recognised. Since DOS cannot access
disks larger than 32Mb, the hard disk was set up as two drives, C: and D:, each of
22Mb. System files and DOS files were then copied to the ROOT directory of C:,
