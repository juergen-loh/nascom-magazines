So what are the lessons here? Well firstly we see that very few of the editing functions
are non-resident (from which we can surmise that the overlay file is broken down
mostly as I described above). Secondly we see that those which are tend to be
infrequently used ones or ones which are inherently slow due to disk access in any
case.

While on the subject of Wordstar, there are a couple of other points to make.
Wordstar stores most of its messages on a separate file rather than in memory.
Because this means they take time to access, a policy is adopted whereby
non-essential messages are only printed at all if the operator seems uncertain. For
example, menus are not displayed if the next key is pressed immediately, Another
aspect of this message system is that individual messages are picked out from the
file. Thus when the operator requests help, only the relevant information is printed.
Returning to the PCB example, this means that if I request help while moving a track
I should not be told how to save the file, print the file, define DIL packs, swap sides
or do anything else not relevant to moving a track, especially if I can&rsquo;t actually do it
at the moment! If I ask for help when moving a track I should be told how to move
the track, how to deposit it and how to abort (if I can).

Another useful lesson from Wordstar involves what happens when the non- resident
code I needed is finished. If it was a major item returning to the opening menu (or
completion of a PCB printer dump for example) then it is quite acceptable to reload
the opening menu code. However if you have just deleted a line (perhaps 200 bytes
of code) you don&rsquo;t want to have to wait while the 15K of the main editor is reloaded.
This is where chained files are generally rather inappropriate. What we need to do
is load the special code whilst keeping the existing code in memory. Research
Machines BASIC has a command to do this. It is called MERGEGO, and operates
by reading a disk file onto the current program without deleting any of the program
which does not clash. The big problem here (and it is quite significant) is that the
program data is erased in the process since the program is being modified. Also,
MERGEGO is very slow since the input file has to be in ASCII listing format. In
any case, RM BASIC is interpreted so the program can be instantly made to use
less memory by compiling.

In any program or suite of programs there will be a considerable amount of common
code (e.g. I/O, disk handling, standard runtime routines). In many compilers much
of this code occupies standard locations, and in almost all compilers it is possible
to arrange for the majority of it to occupy standard locations. Once we have done
this, at no penalty in terms of size or speed, it would seem very silly to reload all this
code every time. In my PCB system, there are runtimes from 100h to 1100h (the
compiler always puts them there) and a set of global functions to overcome compiler
limitations which reside at the top of memory. These blocks of code are loaded at
the start and remain resident until the user returns to CP/M. Among the code at
top of memory are two routines to handle the disks. One routine loads and executes
