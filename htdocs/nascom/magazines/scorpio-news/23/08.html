<b>Fast Step</b><br>
Older drives require their step pulses at 3mS intervals, newer ones with &lsquo;buffered
seek&rsquo; accept step pulses in a quick burst. The FAST step equate is hidden away in
the MAP BIOS. Normally it&rsquo;s set for fast stepping (a value of 5), but for slower drives
such as the Seagate 506 a value of 1 is needed.
</p>
<p>
For any ST506 type winnie just 4 (possibly 5) values need setting, there&rsquo;s no format
info

<h2>
Lets Go!!!
</h2>
<p>
With all the new bits plugged up, and a new system on the disk, it&rsquo;s time to try it out.
The winnie should start spinning with power on &amp; take about 20 secs to get to speed.
Meanwhile the boot disk should start loading the CP/M, then nothing will appear
to happen until the winnie reaches speed and self-tests in some cases.
</p>
<p>
With Rodimes the power-on light will flash while the winnie spins- up. It will then
stay on after correct speed and a second light should flash as the CP/M accesses the
winnie. If the power-on light appears to flash in morse code, that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s
flashing an error message, you will need to look-up the error in the Rodime manual
and take any action that Rodime prescribe.
</p>
<p>
If all&rsquo;s well after 30 secs or so you should be able to type DIR A: (or B:/C: if the
winnie is partitioned) and get &ldquo;no file&rdquo;, or perhaps a list of juicy files left on by the
previous owner.
</p>
<p>
But what if all does not go well? Firstly check all cables for correct orientation,
there&rsquo;s several. If reversed it should not do any damage, except power cables (smoke
may accompany this fault!!). Check you have booted off the winnie CP/M disk. If
the system hangs (wait a minute or so) it indicates that the BIOS cannot talk to the
Xebec. If an error message appears it probably means the Xebec cannot talk to the
winnie. Run a winnie test/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>format program this will indicate if the Xebec/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>winnie are
OK and give any errors, It maybe necessary to re-format the winnie before it will
run properly. Try this, if formatting appears to work, things can&rsquo;t be too bad.

Has all the above set you thinking about winnie-ing, your system? If so, give it a go,
because I think you&rsquo;ll enjoy the performance increase and it&rsquo;s not so difficult. If you
need further help I will be quite happy to assist, and can supply a program (&lsquo;wot I
writ&rsquo;) to format/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>test the winnie &amp; controller, for most any winnie.
