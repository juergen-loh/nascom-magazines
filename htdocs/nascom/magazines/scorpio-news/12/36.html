<h3>
BDOSZ Bug
</h3>
<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
The last (first) issue of this magazine featured an article by Mr C Bowden on
improving the user interface to CP/M. In this article Mr Bowden stated that he
had found s bug in BDOSZ. As co-author of BDOSZ I feel duty bound to mention
the following facts and throw users a lifeline.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bowden was correct in what he said when referring to the switching between 8
and 16 bit directory entries under BDOSZ. However, this bug was fixed in
Version 1.3 and I suspect that Mr Bowden has an old copy of BDOSZ. Users of
BDOSZ with a version number of less than 1.7 should also note that there were a
couple of bugs in the Read and Write Random routines. Admittedly, these were
somewhat obscure and haven&rsquo;t been reported to me through the dealer chain but I
feel duty bound to mention them. As far as I&rsquo;m aware, there are few programs
that are affected by the last two bugs, but I do know that the Library Utility
(LU.COM) can come to grief as it uses random reads and writes. The current
version of BDOSZ is 1.8 and features special handling of the IX sad IY
registers, for users who have BIOSs that use these registers, and a totally re-written
error handler to improve compatibility with the DRI BDOS.
</p>
<p>
Armed with a copy of this magazine I am hopeful that users wishing to upgrade
will be able to take their distribution disk to their friendly 80-BUS dealer and
obtain version 1.8 for nothing more than a nominal copying fee. Failing this I
should be pleased to provide this service. All I would require is the original
BDISZ distribution disk, together with either UK postage stamps to cover postage
or a cheque made out to me to cover the cost of postage (you should know how
much to enclose since you are sending the disk to me). Don&rsquo;t forget to enclose
your name and address and please allow 28 days for delivery (I may need it if
there is a rush).
</p>
<p>
My thanks co the Editor for publishing this letter and, of course, thanks for
providing us 80-BUS addicts with an excellent magazine. There are some of us,
at least, who would pay almost any price for a quality 80-BUS magazine like
this, and there were those of us who would have attempted to start our own
(Chris &ldquo;Dr Dark&rdquo; Blackmore for instance) if Paul had not done so.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully, M.W.T Waters, _ _________ _____, Stanmore, Middx. ___ ___
