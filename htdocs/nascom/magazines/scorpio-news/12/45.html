The MPI is supplied either ready built, or as akit. A-number of options are
available:
</p>
<p>
FOC and Winchester controller
(2797 or 2793 FOC Controller, depending upon system)
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The board or kit 12 supplied with ehe appropriate combination of options a
Ordered. The PCB ia the standard 8" aquere, with the usuel Map 60 blue resist
&lsquo;and high qualicy Kit assembly is quire straightforward and the instructions
are reasonably clear &ndash; there is a separate assembly manual which T didn&rsquo;t
Feceive but s phone call to Map soon solved the problea.
</p>
<p>
There are 22 Links on the boerd, some of which are not needed for standard
Configurations and &laquo;20 way Link header to be wired up if one vants the $10
and/or CTC facilities Details of the link functions and also the changes
hecessary to accommodate the 2793 controller, if the board is to beused at a
Iueae/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Nascom compatible FDC, are provided.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;A slight disadvantage 42 that the instructions are not very clear on which Links
fre needed for particular uses = sy boards have Links 2 (a-b),3 3 (a-b).8 (a&gt;
a). 13 (em), e (a- 13m) 18 (acc), 16 (COM-B), 17 (bec},18 (28, 4-3), and 21
(a clk). Map will supply details of modifications required to read odd disk
Formate with bad side 2 flage, which wight be necessary 4f you wish to wee
thefr Format transfer progremt No details ave provided of the crystal
Exequencies or types required for on-board frequency generation.
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;he 810 and CTC seen co be standard dmplenentations using the 2804 CTC and ST
Chips. &lsquo;The ciecuitey around the 2/97 seems to be almgst identical to thee
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;on Che VPC nnd the AG485 Interface te provided oy ditterentini Tine ariver and
Fecelver (75174/75175), in conteast co the R5232 interface which uses the
Eonventional 75188 and 75169 types.
</p>
<p>
My main use for the MPI is as a Floppy/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Winchester controller and both the ready-buiit
and kit versions have performed without trouble vith a vide range of other
boards from Nascom, Map and Gemini In particular, the combination of the MPI
with TEAC compatible drives and the Map version of CP/M Plus provides fast,
quiet disk access = T hate nofay computers!
</p>
<p>
As I sometimes need to copy disks with peculiar formats, the small modifications
Co the beard for this purpose are easily made I&rsquo;don&rsquo;t need to use either the
S10 or CTC functions (although they are implemented on one of the boards) T
use the Serial o/p on the Map or Gemini cP board for this,
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;the fully-assembled version with FDC, CTC and S10 options is possibly a bit
pricey av &pound;195 + VAT but money can be raved by building the kit youreel? &ndash; not
Long job &ndash; possibly a couple of evenings. Host users need only the FDC/SAST
version and this ig quite a bit cheaper T haven&rsquo;t seen an up-to-date price
Tis feom Gemini or Map but suspect that the ready built FOC/SASI is about. the
same price as the GMe29 or GHaig (Cie5, in the last price list I saw from
</p>
<p>
Te &lsquo;would be worth contacting Map to see what their current prices are
</p>
<p>
I can thoroughly recommend this product for anyone contemplating upgrading an
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;a0 BUS system even if they already have the Gemini #09 FOC, since it will enable
</p>
<p>
them to take full advantage of higher access speeds and quieter operation If the
</p>
<p>
newer TEAC-compatibie drives are used. (Ed. &ndash; alternatively readers may like to
fe the GH809 modifications shown elsewhere in this issue ]
