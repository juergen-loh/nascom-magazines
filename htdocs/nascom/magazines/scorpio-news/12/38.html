specification sheets say the daverter (an L504) can sink a current of Sua

and eink current (e

&lsquo;The only components required are an LED and 330 ohm 1/8 or 1/4 watt resistor.
The LED should be small (3mm) type but can be any colour, T just happened to
have a red one Co hand. Figure 2 shove the connections in both plan and frontal
views

<p>
1) Solder the 330 ohm resistor onto pins 9 and 14 on LB2 (component #ide) of
card &lsquo;number i.
</p>
<p>
2) Using single cored connection wire (wire wrapping cable {e ideal) m
following connections on the underside of the board.

Ler pin 16 to LB2 pin 2
</p>
<p>
3) Carefully bend and crop the leads of the LED as shown in figure 2. Mote
that the LED is correctly orientated, the cathode end (flat on package) 2
Free, Solder the anode co the positive pin of C46 on the component side of
the board
</p>
<p>
4) Now solder # Length of single cored wire to the LED cathode (free end),
then poke the wire through the plate through hole adjacent to Ic7 ac shows
in figure 2. &lsquo;Solder the free end of the wire to LBZ pin 14. Since the
Hinai &lsquo;Link involves the wire parsing through the hole, it ie advisable to

you plan to use enamelled wire, then I re of
Insulacion over the wire and position 1 ah

<p>
prevent the edges of the hole piercing the vire&rsquo;s insulation.
