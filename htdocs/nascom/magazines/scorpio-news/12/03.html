Tiret of all, thank you for the positive response to the firat tesue You will
Find a representative sample of Letters received Later on in this {eave (i.e
&lsquo;representatives in that st is virtually all of ehem!).
</p>
<p>
The bad news, I&rsquo;m afraid, is that we have &ldquo;lost* a fair number of ex 80-BUS
News ys. &ldquo;This is probebly for a number of
be considered inappropriate for those still using unexpended Mi
apathy; cost oF changes of computing interest The good news is
that we have &ldquo;| fubseeibere, including at Lease one NOW
S0-BUS/Nesbus User, and to all of then, welcome,
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The direction thet Scorpio News takes over the next issues will be guided by two
ain things. The first is what YOU the reader wants. Write a letter to us for
publication expounding your views; write a brief (or long) article on your
Favourite computing topic. YoU can steer the direction probably wore than you
realfse, IF you do something about it
</p>
<p>
The second guiding force is considerstion for expanding the number of
Gubsccabers &copy; At the current level I&rsquo;m sad to say thet we are unlikely to
Continue into @ second Volume, but if we can double or treble (or more!) the
humbers then that&rsquo;s &laquo;different story So there are at least two possibsliti
here One is don&rsquo;t lend friends or colleagues yaur News, but each of you work
on two oF three of chen to also subscribe &lsquo;The other 4c to broaden the areas of
Coverage of Scorpio News I&rsquo;ll eay Little more on this now. Read Dave Hunt
carefully, A sunber of people are STILL using 20-
What do YoU conclude?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s YOUR own interest?
</p>
<p>
nding the areas of coverage may dissipate the
Printing has high plave/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>eetup/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>finiehing
charges, but lowieh unit costes I would eatimate that with FOUR times the
subscribers we could have TWICE as many pages for the SAME subscription. finnnl
