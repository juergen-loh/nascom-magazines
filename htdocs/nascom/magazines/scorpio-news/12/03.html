Editorial

<p>
First of all, thank you for the positive response to the first <a href="../text/"></a>issue. You will
find a representative sample of letters received later on in this issue (i.e.
&lsquo;representative&rsquo; in that it is virtually all of them!).
</p>
<p>
The bad news, I&rsquo;m afraid, is that we have &lsquo;lost&rsquo; a fair number of ex. 80-BUS
News subscribers. This is probably for a number of reasons &ndash; Scorpio News may
be considered inappropriate for those still using unexpended Nascom&nbsp;1s or 2s;
apathy; cost of changes of computing interest. The good news is
that we have &lsquo;gained&rsquo; quit a few subscribers, including at least one NON
80-BUS/Nasbus user, and to all of them, welcome.
</p>
<p>
The direction that Scorpio News takes over the next issues will be guided by two
main things. The first is what YOU the reader wants. Write a letter to us for
publication expounding your views; write a brief (or long) article on your
favourite computing topic. You can steer the direction probably more than you
realise, IF you do something about it
</p>
<p>
The second guiding force is consideration for expanding the number of
subscribers. At the current level I&rsquo;m sad to say that we are unlikely to
continue into a second volume, but if we can double or treble (or more!) the
numbers then that&rsquo;s a different story. So there are at least two possibilities
here. One is don&rsquo;t lend friends or colleagues your News, but each of you work
on two or three of them to also subscribe. The other is to broaden the areas of
coverage of Scorpio News. I&rsquo;ll say little more on this now. Read Dave Hunt&rsquo;s
article and the letters carefully. A nunber of people are STILL using 80-BUS
but now ALSO PCs/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Clones. What do YOU conclude? What&rsquo;s YOUR own interest?
</p>
<p>
Finally, to any that fear that expanding the areas of coverage may dissipate the
content too much, a few figures. Printing has high plate/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>setup/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>finishing
charges, but lowish unit costs. I would estimate that with FOUR times the
subscribers we could have TWICE as many pages for the SAME subscription. Hmmm!
