A quick tap on the calculator keyboard will have told you that, assuming say, a
2K block size and 8 bit directory entries will allow a maximum of 32K to be
referenced by a directory entry. This implies (correctly) that more than one
directory entry will be required to hold the block numbers for larger files.
CP/M automatically takes care of this problem for us. When writing to disk, if
a directory entry is filled, CP/M closes it (by writing it to disk) and opens a
new one. It should be noted that each time CP/M has read or written all of the
blocks allocated by a single directory entry, it has to read the next entry
from, or write the next entry to disk. Logically, it would appear that to
improve the performance of the disk system (i.e. speed up access), the block
size should be as large as possible so that CP/M would need to access the
directory track of the disk less often (since extra time is needed to move the
disk drive head from where it is now to the directory track and back again). It
would also appear that with a 16K block size and 8 bit directory entries, CP/M
would only have to access the directory track once for every 256K of a file that
it is reading or writing. However, maybe due to a hangover from CP/M&nbsp;1.4 (which
always held 16Ks worth of block information per directory entry), CP/M&nbsp;2.2 and
CP/M Plus STILL access the directory track every 16K.
</p>
<p>
If we return briefly to the number of blocks reserved for directory entries, we
can see that we must have enough to allow access to the available disk space.
With the Gemini QDDS format, each directory entra can refer to 64K since 8 bit
entries are used with a 4k block size. The minimum number of directory entries
required to access the 196 data blocks on disk will be 13. However, if we were
to take the average sized file to be about 8K then to fill a disk with them we
shall need at least 98 directory entries. In practice, Gemini chose 128
directory entries which, while entirely adequate for most purposes, try filling
a disk with 4K files or programs. When all 128 directory entries have been
used, there is still 272K of free space remaining. To be fair, this is an
extreme example and will occur very rarely (unless you use dbaseII, in which
case it will probably occur daily as the average dbaseII .CMD file seems to fit
in a 4K block).
</p>
<p>
The choices, then, facing a manufacturer when deciding upon block sizes are a
compromise of disk size, number of directory entries and speed of access. If
Gemini had used a smaller block size for their QDDS format (2K for example),
CP/M&nbsp;2.2 (or CP/M&nbsp;3) would have used 16 bit entries in the directory.
Consequently, four times as many directory entries would have been required.
Why four? Each directory entry would refer to 2 blocks &ndash; hence twice as many
directory entries would be required to hold the block numbers for the same sized
file BUT each block number would now occupy twice as much room in the directory
entry so double the number of directory entries again. Similarly, the BDOS
would have to access the directory track four times as often with a
corresponding reduction in disk performance.
</p>
<p>
A further complication that prevents the use of a 1K block size with larger
disks is due to the way CP/M itself works. Let&rsquo;s have a quick history lesson.
</p>
<p>
CP/M&nbsp;1.4 uses single density disks (although some micro manufacturers have made
it work with double density) with a fixed 1k block size and 8 bit directory
entries. Each directory entry, therefore. refers to 16K (which we all recognise
as an extent). CP/M&nbsp;1.4 allows a file/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>disk to contain a maximum of 16 extents
numbered 0-15, hence a maximum file/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>disk size of 256K (16 x 16K). A hangover
from CP/M&nbsp;1.4 is that each directory entry MUST be able to control at least one
extent. If we are using 16 bit directory entries, each block must be at least
2K long since the directory can only hold 8 block numbers. This applies equally
to CP/M&nbsp;2.2 and CP/M&nbsp;3.
</p>
<p>
We have already seen that the directory occupies at least one block in the data
area of the disk. Under CP/M, the directory blocks are always the first ones in
the data area and it follows that block 0 will always contain directory
information. This being the case, at no time will CP/M ever need to allocate
block 0 to a file. For these reasons, zeros in the directory entry may be used
to signify that no further blocks have been allocated to a file.
