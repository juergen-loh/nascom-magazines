prompt. Any other key goes straight to an online HELP file that I have
provided, summarizing the main features of Z3.
</p>
<p>
On going to the CCP prompt, the first thing to be noticed is that the prompt
includes the DIR: name as well as the DU:&nbsp;&ndash; for example A0:BASE&gt;. A few tests
with the DU: and DIR: forms confirm the ease of moving around, and cross
user/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>disk commands like A15:ROOT&gt;DIR P0: show the flexibility. With the various
command and associated overlay files in the relevant names directories, it is so
useful to be able to type BAS: or PEN: or WS: to access the required area,
without having to remember on which DU: I have decided to put things
</p>
<p>
Type an H, and see the RCP commands displayed, Type a P xxxx, and get a 256 byte
Hex and ASCII dump from address xxxx. Try a few POKE commands, and use P to see
the result. (Don&rsquo;t poke the Operating system unless you know what you are
doing.)
</p>
<p>
I use a Winnie with .HLP files in HELP:, and Z3 commands and other utilities in
ROOT:. It is very nice to be in say D6:, and be able to type HELP DIRS without
moving or worrying where the files are. The path and HELP.COM sorts it all out.
</p>
<p>
On my system I flip Drives A: and Ramdisk&nbsp;&ndash; A: is now my vdisk, I have set up
my Winnie as Drives H: and B: (The H: is for Hard). The system logs on to
A0:MDSK&gt; on Cold Boot and I normally use MDSK&gt; for work as this greatly speeds
any warm boot, and processing is much faster than even a Winnie).

<p>
This completes the review of ZCPR3 and its utilities. In the second part I will
discuss the installation of the system.

Since carrying out the series of benchmarks which were published in Scorpio News
V1 I1 (Jan-Mar. 1987), I have acquired one or two more compilers and
interpreters which I&rsquo;ve cried out on a Genial Multiboard system fitted with the
GM888 processor, under CP/M-80 (2.2) and CP/M-86, as appropriate. For purposes
of comparison, I ran the same benchmark on an Amstrad PC1512 using MSDOS and DOS
Plus&nbsp;&ndash; the latter enables one to run CP/M-86 programs.
</p>
<p>
The results are quite interesting. The benchmark used was
<?php externalLink("Dr. Dobb's Journal, Volume 8, Issue 9, Page 120", "obtained from Dr Dobbs Journal"); ?>
in which the idea was to produce a result as near to 2500 as
possible, using a range of intrinsic functions available in the interpreter or
compiler.
</p>
<p>
The following language implementations were available:
</p>
<table class="indent" style="width: 70%">
<tr><td>Nevada Fortran</td><td>(Z80, CP/M&nbsp;80)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Utah Fortran</td><td>(MSDOS)</td></tr>
<tr><td>ProFortran</td><td>(CP/M-86 and DOS Plus)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microsoft Fortran-77</td><td>(MSDOS)</td></tr>
<tr><td>BASIC86 v. 5.28</td><td>(MSDOS)</td></tr>
<tr><td>BASIC86 v. 5.21</td><td>(DOS Plus)</td></tr>
<tr><td>GWBASIC</td><td>(MSDOS)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The Fortran versions were all compiled and the BASICs were all interpreted.
The Amstrad uses the 8086 16 bit CPU with a system clock frequency of 8MHz,
while the GM888 uses the 8088 8/16 bit CPU at 8MHz with I/O via the 4MHz 80-BUS.
</p>
<p>
The results were as follows:
