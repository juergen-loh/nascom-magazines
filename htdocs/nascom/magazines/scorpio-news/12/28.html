<p>
<b>MKDIR</b> will allow the creation of new named directory segment files. This is
also possible by editing and assembling the SYSNDR.ASM/LIB files provided with
the system, but MKDIR is interactive and easier to use.
</p>
<p>
<b>CD.COM</b> works with either DIR: or DU: forms. If CD is used to log into a new
directory, instead of doing this by just typing say B7: oF BAS:, when CD logs
into the target directory, it looks for a file (ST.COM), which contains a
command sequence. This could, for example, set up new function keys, reprogram
the printer, change the Named directory segment, change I/O parameters and carry
out other similar setting up operations.

<h3>
File Protection and Maintenance&nbsp;&ndash;
</h3>
<p>
The <b>PROT</b> command of the RCP allows attribute bits to be changed. <b>PROTECT.COM</b> is
a much more sophisticated command which will set or reset the file name tag
bite, filetype attribute bite, and will allow &lsquo;inspect&rsquo; and &lsquo;control&rsquo; modes so
that the user may exercise varying degrees of control over the process.
</p>
<p>
<b>CRC.COM</b> is provided in Z3 compatible format. The same algorithm is used as in
the other CRC command files that have been available from the CPMUG over the
years, so that compatibility is maintained. The Z3 CRC command outputs the file
nane, Size in K Bytes and records, Counts Lines of text (text files), supports
printer output, Disk File output, and allows comments to be added to each file,
supports optional inspect mode. Options may as usual be mixed. (On the Z3
disks, is included
<a href="../../../../80-bus-news/35/27/text/#article1">CRC.COM Vers. 5</a>
which was described in a late 80-BUS News.
Z3 CRC.COM does net compare CRC&rsquo;s with a current CRCKLIST, as CRC Vers. 5 does,
so both files are useful.)
</p>
<p>
<b>DIFF.COM</b> is a file comparison utility. It may optionally be told to stop at the
first difference, or list all differences on a byte for byte basis. Files may
be in different directories. Multiple runs are supported. i.e. Disks may be
essentially the same. It is therefore useful to have the Z3 utility and one or
two of the others available.
</p>
<h3>
Help Systems&nbsp;&ndash;
</h3>
<p>
The version of <b>HELP.COM</b> supplied is tailored to Z3, and will find files in A16:
which is suggested as the HELP: directory. Extensive help files are provided,
totaling over 500k, although some refer co SYSLIB and VLIB which are not
directly related to the operational aspects of Z3. Some of the HELP files
operate on an elaborate &lsquo;tree&rsquo; system. Sufficient help is provided to enable
all of the utilities to be successfully used. With a Winnie, this HELP can all
be online. Two supporting utilities <b>HELPCK.COM</b> and <b>HELPPR.COM</b>, are provided to
check the format of HELP files that one might write, and to allow hard copy of
the .HLP file without wasting paper.
</p>
<p>
<b>PAGE.COM</b> is a utility that can be used instead of the TYPE command to display
files on screen. It is clever enough to make allowance for lines longer than
screen length.
</p>
<p>
The <b>SAK</b> utility is extremely useful. It waits for the user to strike any key &ndash;
hence the name. It can provide a number of features such as time out, ring the
console bell, abort to CP/M.
</p>
<p>
<b>SHOW.COM</b> is the Z3 display utility. It will display data about the Z3 system,
its&rsquo; buffers and segments in a very informative and useful way.
</p>
<p>
<b>PRINT.COM</b> is a sophisticated file print utility. It supports a number of
options like multiple file printing, page skipping and so on. I have customized
my version so that it reads the system clock and prints this on the first page
of the output.
