<h3>
Own Up, and Make Money!
</h3>
<p>
When I treated my system to its Gemini GM822 SVC (video) board, I found that is
was possible for it to operate a keyboard, taking some of the load off the main
processor. This would let me make things go faster, which is becoming an
obsessive pursuit. But the SVC wanted to speak to either a serial or parallel
keyboard from the Gemini range, and I happen to have a Nascom&nbsp;II keyboard.
</p>
<p>
It would have cost quite a lot to buy either of the Gemini keyboards, I think
they are around the &pound;140+VAT mark, so that idea was out. But the dealer who
sold me the SVC (no names as I feel they should pay for their advertising)
happened to mention that a member of a Thames Valley Nascom user group had made
up some boards that would fit in between the Nascom&nbsp;II keyboard and the SVC. He
said that these boards had a cpu of their own, which just scanned the keys and
passed on what it found.
</p>
<p>
As well as the advantage of things running faster, this would also let me take
advantage of the keyboard type-ahead that the SVC allows. So if you happen to
be in possession of a spare one of the converter boards, I would be very pleased
to hear from you I might even buy one if the price is sensible. Incidentally,
I have heard that perhaps this user group has been photocopying magazines. This
practice is of course illegal, but copying my stuff also carries a curse the
like of which has not been around since the Pharaohs.
</p>
<h3>
There is always a catch!
</h3>
<p>
The catch in this case is that if I do take the keyboard scanning load away from
the main processor, it will mean that my CP/M will need to be sorted out to
recognise the new keyboard, instead of carrying out the original scanning
routine. But I have been meaning to do that for ages, in order to use the new
improved BIOS software that is now available (I hear it goes faster) and was
described in the last Scorpio News.
</p>
<p>
No great problem, apart from finding the time, you might think. However, my
CP/M has already been modified to provide a RAM disk on two MAP-80 RAM boards,
and I have no idea what they have done, or where they did it. I suppose I will
have to find where the old CP/M and the present one are different, and then
disassemble the new bits. The result will then need to be incorporated in the
improved system. Maybe MAP-80 will write an article about how their
notification works. I think that would be very interesting to read, and it
could also give some clues about another thing I would do, if I only knew how.
It would be very handy in certain circumstances to be able to get CP/M to think
the RAM disk is drive A, and vice versa. There is still some software around
that insists on being on drive A, which I would like better if it went at drive
P speeds! Has anyone managed to achieve this? Then tell us all how, don&rsquo;t keep
it to yourself!

<h3>
That Pascal Benchmark Again...
</h3>
<p>
In case you didn&rsquo;t buy the first <a href="../text/"></a>issue of Scorpio News, here is the Pascal
version of a benchmark program from Dr Dobbs&rsquo; Journal (no relation) no 83, which
is supposed to show you how fast and how accurate the language you are using is.

with the trigonometry and exponentiation, etc. }
