<h3>
Attention MultiNet User
</h3>
<p>
Dear sir,
</p>
<p>
I would like to make contact with fellow subscribers of Scorpio News who use a
Gemini MultiNet System, so we can exchange newe, views, ideas and problems.
</p>
<p>
To encourage you to contact me, if you send me a formatted QDDS disk and return
postage, I will give you corrected version of NSWEEP207 that will run on
MultiNet 2.4. Furthermore, it will copy to all 32 CP/M user numbers, has more
facilities than <span class="uppercase">Netsweep</span> and is half its size (12K).
</p>
<p>
I hope soon to have a version working <span class="uppercase">Directly</span> with the 96 MultiNet user
numbers!
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely, John S. Radley. __ _______ ____, West Ealing, London, ___ ___.

<h3>
Wrong Computer?
</h3>
<p>
Dear sir,
</p>
<p>
You may be interested to know that over the years I have only missed out on
about 5 of the very first Nascom mags. I am grateful for the hints and
information from Dave, Paul and Chris (not forgetting the many other
contributors) and would like to thank them for their efforts.
</p>
<p>
I hope hat Scorpio News will continue to maintain the standards which I&rsquo;m sure
host readers prefer. I personally feel that the a unique way of
presenting. itself as a source of information without &lsquo;Talking Down&rsquo; to its less
knowledgeable readers. It would be a pity to see it turn into the usual 2 pages
of info and 52 pages of adverts!
</p>
<p>
I have no ambitions to join this computer &lsquo;Professionals&rsquo; but I have learned a
great deal since buying my old Nascom&nbsp;2 in 1978. Unfortunately the Nascom has
now gone, but I intend to subscribe to Scorpio News for at least one more year
if only to read the items of general interest.
</p>
<p>
I now possess a CBM&nbsp;128 which suits my circumstances reasonably well but might
have done better if its firmware writers had read more 80-BUS mags!!! I was
thinking of trying to re-write Nas-Sys in <?php externalLink("6502"); ?> code but that&rsquo;s another story.
</p>
<p>
Once again my thanks to the people who have contributed to the Nascom mags so
far I hope you don&rsquo;t mind a CBM user reading your efforts.
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully, Charles Tame, Nuneaton, Warks.
