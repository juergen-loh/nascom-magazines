on the ZC/TOn pin. This stream of pulses is then fed as a clock to the
appropriate channel of the <?php externalLink("Z80 SIO", "SIO", ""); ?>. This situation covers the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 CPU","MAP CPU"); ?> with the default links as provided:

<table style="width: 100%">
<tr><td>LB2/2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/10</td><td>LB2/3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/9</td><td>LB2/13&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/12</td><td>LB2/1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/14</td></tr>
<tr><td>LB1/18&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/4</td><td>LB1/19&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/3</td><td>LB1/17&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/5+6</td><td>LB1/16&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/7</td></tr>

One other point which should be mentioned. Always use the assembler to
calculate byte counts and ratios as far as possible. Remember that it does only
16 bit arithmetic, so we can&rsquo;t use it to compute the division ration, but we
certainly can and should use it to work out the byte count.
</p>
<p>
Suppose we require to use a modem? The CCITT V23 standard will require that we
can receive and transmit at different baud rates (1200/75). Under the set up
above, we have the receive and transmit clocks for SIO channel A tied to the
same channel of the <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC", "CTC"); ?> (LB1/17&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/5+6), so we can&rsquo;t manage just as we are
presently linked. We have spare CTC channel 2, and we could use channels 1 and
2 to provide 1200&nbsp;baud and 75&nbsp;baud clocks, and channel 2 to feed the second SIO
channel. First of all, we must remake the links a follows:
</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr><td>LB2/1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/14</td><td>LB2/12&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/13</td><td>LB2/1 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/11</td><td>LB2/2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB2/9+10</td></tr>
<tr><td>LB1/1&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/20</td><td>LB1/2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/19</td><td>LB1/3+4&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/18</td><td>LB1/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/17</td></tr>
<tr><td>LB1/6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/16</td><td>LB1/7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; LB1/15</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
(These are as taken from my system Work. them out carefully&nbsp;&ndash; you may not need
them all!). If we feed CTC channels 0 and 1 from the same clock (2MHz external)
can we get the baud rates required? We have already done the calculation for
the 1200&nbsp;baud and know that 104 is the divisor. How about 75&nbsp;baud?
</p>
<table class="center" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td></td><td>2000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>divisor = </td><td>-----------</td><td>= 1666.7</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>75*16</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
We can&rsquo;t fit that into one byte. Even using 64* mode on our SIO, we can&rsquo;t do
it. If we went to a 1&nbsp;MHz clock, we can just manage. Unfortunately, I like to
drive printers very fast, and for computer/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>computer links, with no modems, I
like 9600&nbsp;baud. If we use 1&nbsp;MHz clock, I can&rsquo;t get 9600&nbsp;baud. Is there another
way?
</p>
<p>
Suppose we consider using the timer mode and consider first the 1200/75&nbsp;baud
problem. If we divide the system clock (4Mhz) by 256 in the prescaler, could we
get the 75&nbsp;baud we need? Let&rsquo;s try:
</p>
<table class="center" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td></td><td>4000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>divisor = </td><td>-----------</td><td>= 13</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>75*16*256</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Lovely! Now we try for the 1200&nbsp;baud. Immediately we realise that we&rsquo;ll have
to use the /16 prescaler rather than the /256.
</p>
<table class="center" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td></td><td>4000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>divisor = </td><td>-----------</td><td>= 13</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>1200*16*16</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
No problems here! How about 9600&nbsp;baud?
</p>
<table class="center" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td></td><td>4000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>divisor = </td><td>-----------</td><td>= 1.6</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>9600*16*16</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
So that won&rsquo;t work for 9600&nbsp;baud. We are in the position that we can get
1200/75&nbsp;baud clocks by using the divider mode of the CTC, but can&rsquo;t get 9600
baud. If we apply a 2&nbsp;MHz external clock, we can get 9600&nbsp;baud clock, and
slower, but not 75&nbsp;baud. What do we do? We set up the links as above,
supplying a 2&nbsp;MHz clock to the CLK/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TRG pins of the appropriate channels, and
