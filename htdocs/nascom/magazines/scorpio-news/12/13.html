on the 2C/TOn pin. This stream of pulses is then fed ass clock to the
appropelate channel of the S10&rdquo; This situation covers the MAP CPU with the
defaule Links a8 provided:

Let/ie = B74 tenis &gt; tpi/3 &copy; CBn/i7 = Lai/ses &mdash;uBt/ae &ndash; Lai/7
UB /20 &gt; Lan
</p>
<p>
one other point which should be mentioned. Always uso the assembler to
calculate byte counts and ratioe af far as possible. kemember thar it does only
16 bit arithmetic, 20 we can&rsquo;t use it to compute the division ration, but we
Certainly can and should use it co work out the byte count
</p>
<p>
Suppose we require to modem? The CCITT Y23 standard will require that we
can ceceive and transmit at different baud cates (1200/75). Under the set up
above, we have the receive and transmit clocks for S10 channel A tied to the
Sane channel of the CTC (LB1/17 -Usl/5+6), so ve can&rsquo;t manage just as we are
Presently inked. We have space CTC channel 2, and we could use channels 1 and
BYto provide 1200 baud and 73 baud clocks, and &lsquo;channel 2 to feed the second S10
channel. Piret of ali, we gust remake the Links a follows:
</p>
<p>
baz/a &ndash; up2/is-uaz/i2 &ndash; basis Leesa tessa Lele &ndash; uaz/snio
gana cupaias beae cpa ten tara darts &gt; bales
tei/e &gt; upi/ie Lat? uai/as
</p>
<p>
(These ae as taken from ny system Work them out cazefully &ndash; you may not need
them alll). If we feed CTC channels 0 and 1 from the same clock (2Hiz external)
Gen we get the baud rates required? We have already done the calculation for
the 1200 baud and know that 10c is the divivor How about 75 baud?
</p>
<p>
2000000
divigor = Senne = 16667
75816
</p>
<p>
We can&rsquo;t fit that into one byte Even using 64* mode on our Sto, we can&rsquo;t do
in &ldquo;TE we went to a1 Hiiz clock, we can just manage Unfortunately, I like to
ative printers very fast, and for computer/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>compure: Links, with no modems, T
Like &lsquo;9600 baud. TE we use 1 Miz clock, T can&rsquo;t get 9600 baud.&rdquo; Ta there another
vay?
</p>
<p>
Suppose we consider using the timer mode and consider first the 1200/75 baud
</p>
<p>
probles. if we divide the system clock (4Mhz) by 256 in the presesler, could we
Bet the 75 baud we need?&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s try:
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;4000000
158168256
</p>
<p>
divisor &copy;
</p>
<p>
Lovely! Now we try for the 1200 baud. Immediately we realise that we&rsquo;ll have
to use che [16 preacaler rather than the [256
</p>
<p>
4000000
divisor = Sven = 28
adootibens
No problems here! How about 9600 baud?
&lsquo;4000000
divisor = senenee = 16
preererests
</p>
<p>
So that won&rsquo;t work for 9600 baud. We are in the position that we can get
1200/75 baud clocks by using che divider mode of the CTC, but can&rsquo;t get 9600
baud. &ldquo;rf &lsquo;we apply a 2 Miix external clock, we can get 9600 baud clock, and
slower, but aot 75 beud. What do we doi We set up the links as sbover
supplying&raquo; 2 Mz clock to the CLK/TAG pins of the appropriate channels, and
