Some time ago <a href="../../14/text/#ref1">[1]</a> I wrote on aspects of the
<a href="../../../../80-bus-news/21/06/text/#article1">Z80 microcomputer&rsquo;s interrupt structure</a>.
In the article, I dealt mainly with the Z80 <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO", ""); ?>. Since then there
have been many requests for another article to deal with the other Z80 family
chips. In this and a subsequent article it is my intention to cover the
intricacies of programming the following chips:

<table>
<tr><td>The <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC", "CTC"); ?></td><td>(Counter Timer Circuit)</td></tr>
<tr><td>The <?php externalLink("Z80 SIO", "SIO", ""); ?></td><td>(Serial Input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Output Controller)</td></tr>
<tr><td>The <?php externalLink("Z80 DART", "DART"); ?></td><td>(Dual Asynchronous Receiver/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Transmitter)</td></tr>
</table>
<?php columnEnd(4); ?>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<p>
Fortunately, the DART is a reduced specification SIO, providing only the
asynchronous facilities, so for brevity I will simply refer to the SIO, and in
general the DART will also be implied.
</p>
<p>
For ease of understanding, I propose to discuss the CTC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SIO pair as used on the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 CPU","MAP CPU"); ?> and
<?php externalLink("MAP80 MPI","MAP MPI"); ?> boards.
On these boards the CTC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SIO group provide a most
powerful, fully programmable, serial input/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>output unit. This is not the only
possible use for these chips, but it will serve well as an introduction, besides
being the most common configuration for them.

Serial I/O interconnections have been very adequately dealt with in
<a href="../../14/text/#ref2">[2]</a> and
<a href="../../14/text/#ref3">[3]</a>,
and interested readers are referred to those articles for detail coverage of the
subject. For the newcomer, it is appropriate to give a minimum explanation to
set the scene. A Serial I/O chip is one which is given a byte of data and
which squirts it out bit by bit onto a pair of wires&nbsp;&ndash; rather like a lump of
dough being fed through a spaghetti maker&nbsp;&ndash; our new improved modified spaghetti
maker which makes only one strand at a time! That is the act of transmission.
Such a chip is also capable of receiving the individual bite of data and
reassembling them into a byte&nbsp;&ndash; scrunching up all the fresh spaghetti to end up
with a lump of dough again. There are other concerns, which need not affect us
here, such as level shifting from TTL levels (0-5&nbsp;volt) to RS232 levels
(+/&ndash;&nbsp;12&nbsp;volt), as these problems are dealt with in the articles cited.
</p>
<p>
If we imagine that we have a spaghetti maker at one end of a table manufacturing
a single strand of spaghetti, and a reverse spaghetti maker at the other, we can
hove pieces of dough from one end of the table to the other by feeding the
output of one machine into the input of the other. It is easy to see that if
the generator makes the spaghetti faster than the other machine consumes it, we
will soon have a big pile of spaghetti on the table. If the consuming machine
consumes faster than the maker, then the strand of spaghetti keeps getting
pulled tight end breaking. So it becomes obvious that both machines must work
at the same pace. Similarly when transmitting data from one serial device to
another, they must both work at the same rate, or in jargon, be &lsquo;clocked at the
same rate&rsquo;. One of the major problems with serial communications is finding the
rate of transmission or reception, loosely called the &lsquo;baudrate&rsquo;. We will
consider the use of a CTC to provide differing baudrates or &lsquo;clocks&rsquo; for an SIO.

The CTC chip is a 28 pin member of the Z80 family. It comprises four channels,
which are substantially the same. Addressed as four I/O ports, one for each
channel, it can return an interrupt vector from each channel on the occurrence
of certain conditions, which criteria can be programmed into that channel. For
ease of reference, we number the channels from 0 to 3. Channel 0 differs from
the others in that it remembers the interrupt vector for channel 0, and the
onboard circuitry of the CTC is able to modify this interrupt vector to indicate
the interrupting channel. This we will deal with shortly. Channel 3 differs
from the other channels in that it (due to limitations of pin numbers) cannot
output pulses, it can only count them.
</p>
<p>
The manual for the CTC
<a href="../../14/text/#ref4">[4]</a> says that the CTC can be configured as a counter or
as a timer. This is true, but confusing. I find the following picture easier
to grasp: each channel of the CTC is a counter. The channel can be set up to
count pulses arriving on the input pin for that channel (CLocK/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TRiGger input,
CLK/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TRGn, where n refers to the channel number), or to count pulses arriving
