This differs slightly from the method used in the MAP80 BIOS in that they
reverse the port address and byte count (you have been warned!)

Of this, what needs explanation? Channels 0 and 1 are clocked to the CLK/TRGn
pins with 2&nbsp;MHz and 1&nbsp;MHz clocks. Having defined the required baudrates (1200
and 300), we now need to calculate the divisors. Serial I/O chips usually
require their clocks at 16* the required baudrate in the case of channel 0,
1200 baud demands a frequency of 19.2&nbsp;KHz. So the required divisor is:
</p>
<table class="center" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td></td><td>2000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Channel 0 divisor = </td><td>-----------</td><td>= 104.167</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>1200*16</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
for the purposes of the CTC, a divisor of 104 will be quite adequate.
</p>
<p>
Channel 1 presents a similar calculation:
</p>
<table class="center" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td></td><td>1000000</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Channel 1 divisor = </td><td>-----------</td><td>= 208.333</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>300 * 16</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
so we are all right with 208 as the divisor.
</p>
<p>
Channel 3 is explained by the comments. But, I hear someone say, just what is
happening? The external clock is being divided down by the CTC channel using
the divisors set out above. Everytime the counter hits zero, it outputs a pulse
