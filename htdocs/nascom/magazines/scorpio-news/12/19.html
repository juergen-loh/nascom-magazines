Having assembled that, and put it into the area of zeros at address &pound;0150, it is
necessary to alter the program so that the patch gets called. Replace the CD 05
00 found at &pound;08A1 with CD 50 01, and save the new version of ED80. In order to
do the same thing to the editor included in the new version of <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal
use the same patch, but put the CD 50 01 at &pound;0AE6.

Open University students wanting to do this will be glad to know that it is easy
to do, using the following line of data in the GEMTERM.DAT file:
&ldquo;OU,3,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>*********,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Y,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>8,N&rdquo;. I have removed the telephone number, and put a row of
stars, to make things more difficult for hackers. It is well known that they
like a challenge, anyway. When they give up, they can always enrol for a course
that makes use of the computers, and get given the umber by the OU.

The only problem I had in running the TEST program, which tells you whether your
terminal is suitable or not was finding what keys to press to generate the
rubout character that is needed instead of backspace. The combination required
turns out to be &ldquo;control shift&nbsp;/&rdquo; on a <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>&nbsp;II keyboard. I searched high end
low for that information, as I felt sue I had it somewhere, but finally decided
it must have been in the Nascom&nbsp;I manuals I disposed of when I sold my Nascom&nbsp;I.
Having resorted to a brute force search, I also found where the &ldquo;|&rdquo; is, that I
had been looking for. C needs it, and it is &ldquo;control shift&nbsp;.&rdquo;. There,
something useful, at last!
