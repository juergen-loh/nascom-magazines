The resulte are of comsiderable interest since they thow that tha quoted speed
of the Gemini 6 bit CPU and @/16 bit co-processor combination is guch greater
than the actual value [2d &ndash; NOI See ay comments below ] The Amstred, working
at 8 Mis is actually 18 times faster than the Gemini combination which appears
</p>
<p>
il speed of 444 Miz, marginelly slower than the 477 Hie of
the 184 pC I&rsquo;war a Little concerned about this go tried the program on &amp;
Samurai 16 bit eachine (vhich runs MSDS snd CP/M-86) using the HSDOS and CP/M
Be versions of BASIC The system clock is 4.608 Wiz and the CPO is an 8086
The numerical values obtained were the same se before but timings were 125 secs
For the HSD0S version and 122 secs for the CP/M-86 version, thus confirming the
slowness of the Gemini combination.

[84. &ndash; sorey, but there is one factor here that you appear to be omitting to
Cake into account, elthough you did mention st earlier The GH86O and IBM-PC
both use the 8088 processor which only has an 8-bit external data bus, as
&lsquo;opposed to your Amstrad which es an 6086 with 16-bit date tus it ie therefore
hoe correct to assume that the IBM&nbsp;PC speed would be 4 77/@ times chat of the
Anstend, it ia considerably slower than this&rdquo; Nor is it correct to celculate
the effective Gemini clock speed by comparing ite benchmark result. to that of
the Amstrad. Nelther of these calcuiacions are comparing Like with Like
</p>
<p>
hen the Gusea board was initially introduced Gemini ran benchmarks on it and on
the #77 Miz T8H-PC The GHBG2/MultiSoned combinet &lsquo;on ran the benchmarks
approximately 281 faster than the IBM = heace the &lsquo;effective&rsquo; speed of the
Gemini is about SHHs, es quoted
</p>
<p>
The areas where your figures are obviously interesting are (8) in being able to
Calculate the perforeance improvement to be had from using the 16-bit data. dus
Versions of the Intel family as opposed to the 8 bit ones, end (b) in seeing the
AGTUAL performance differences of the Amstrad ve the Genin! |

wicrosoft appeac to have improved che accuracy of thetr BASIC in it&rsquo;s HSb0s
Yecsion and&rsquo; but of Interest, T Looked at the perzoraance of thelt 16 bie FORTRAN
nd PASCAL which un under MSDOS Using appropeiees veresons of the benchaark
Progeam, Fortcan-17 ran in 162 secs. on the Anetrad and produced tn acceptable
Value of 2077 24 while the Pascal completed in 130 seconds aad produced an
appalling 390077&rdquo; I&rsquo;m glad i done Reve to use iti &ldquo;Thad hoped co try ov
the&rsquo;usbOs version of Profortran and the CF/H-86 version of ProPascal Out I
ELgn&rsquo;e have access to copiee T suspect that they would run fase and produce
Feasonably accurace resul

<p>
1 included both versions of Ellis Computing&rsquo;s FORTRAN because they are cheap and
quite accurate. Their execution speed is a little slow but for many
Spplications, this 1c not &raquo; great disadvantage.
