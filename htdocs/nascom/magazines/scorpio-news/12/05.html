Language problems
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Thinking of public launches, the retrieval software hat to be multilingual
itr all done ina fairly straight forvard fashion so the software speake
English, German, French and Dutch by anawering the right questions vhen the
progcam is initialized. This has cused oe a Lot of bother, because 1 don&rsquo;t
Speak Feench, German or Dutch. (Bd &ndash; what about English?) The worst instance
took place at the oussive Orgatechnik exhibition in Cologne at the beginning of
November&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s mo sitting in front of my machine on s ctand at the
exhibition, doing demos for ali it&rsquo;s worth (me speaking English, whilst the
program is speaking German, of course), when I typed something stupid and the
progran chrew # wobbly and came up with an error message (in German) There&rsquo;s
hothing quite so embarrassing as having co turn to your audience to atk then to
Eranelace what has happened, because yoo don&rsquo;t understand what your oun sofcware
is"telling yeu
</p>
<p>
unfortunately, the new job doesn&rsquo;t stop there, Writing this sort of stuff is
good chellenge and great fun, but can get boring after a while Oh no,
Eustomers are aq originel lot and come up with Lots of bright ldeas some of
which take me back to the hardware days Noy the retrieval software (s
theoretically capable of handling in excese of 1,000,000,000 records, Fee,
that&rsquo;s I biligon in English or 10 bstlion in American, yet the capacity of you
biggest stand alone IBM micro Ls 32M bytes One customer has 105 million bits
of paper which would require 105 million records, which with indices would
Fequife some 10M byte of disk storage (bigger than&rsquo;the on-line storage of your
Average sini). To Gut a Long story short, I&rsquo;ve managed 20 jack up the storage
on this customer&rsquo;s IBM to 320M bytes and T now have potential storage of 730%

fe someone Lo daft encugh ta want it and can pay the price Other bright
include porting the stuff to a VAX and cunning i&copy; onder emulation (a not
very satisfactary exercise), and foneone has even wanted it on a main frame (I
told thes fot to be silly and run ie under their network instead)

Life&rsquo;s a challenge

Life doesn&rsquo;t seem the same old drag anymore, problems are there as. challenges.
Some you vin, some you lose, either way, you Learn something The only sad
thing Ce chat over the last 8 months I seen to have had little time to do what Z

not true, I&rsquo;ve been carting an 8H AT hone at weekends and
busily converting various bits of software from CP/M to MS-DOS Nice bit of
software the Geminl IBMCOPY. I&rsquo;ve also been finding all the useful Little tools
that T have been using on the old machine, for use on the nev. This har been

the works machines around after me, but that Ls dangerous A real TEM AT with
frills still costs about four and a half grand, it alto weighs about $0. pounds
(Z think they inclade leed weights to help justity the cost) During that snowy
