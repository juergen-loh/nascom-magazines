<h3>
Language problems
</h3>
<p>
Thinking of public launches, the retrieval software has to be multilingual, and
it&rsquo;s all done in a fairly straight forward fashion so the software speaks
English, German, French and Dutch by answering the right questions when the
program is initialized. This has caused me a lot of bother, because I don&rsquo;t
speak French, German or Dutch. [Ed. &ndash; what about English?] The worst instance
took place at the massive OrgaTechnik exhibition in Cologne at the beginning of
November. There&rsquo;s me sitting in front of my machine on a stand at the
exhibition, doing demos for all it&rsquo;s worth (me speaking English, whilst the
program is speaking German, of course), when I typed something stupid and the
program threw a wobbly and came up with an error message (in German). There&rsquo;s
nothing quite so embarrassing as having to turn to your audience to ask them to
translate what has happened, because you don&rsquo;t understand what your own software
is telling you!
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the new job doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Writing this sort of stuff is
good challenge and great fun, but can get boring after a while. Oh no,
customers are an original lot and come up with lots of bright ideas some of
which take me back to the hardware days. Now the retrieval software is
theoretically capable of handling in excess of 1,000,000,000 records, yes,
that&rsquo;s 1 billion in English or 10 billion in American, yet the capacity of your
biggest stand alone IBM micro is 32M bytes. One customer has 10.5 million bits
of paper which would require 10.5 million records, which with indices would
require some 170M byte of disk storage (bigger than the on-line storage of your
average mini). To cut a long story short, I&rsquo;ve managed to jack up the storage
on this customer&rsquo;s IBM to 320M bytes and I now have potential storage of 750M
bytes if someone is daft enough to want it and can pay the price. Other bright
include porting the stuff to a VAX and running it under emulation (a not
very satisfactory exercise), and someone has even wanted it on a main frame (I
told them not to be silly and run it under their network instead).

<h3>
Life&rsquo;s a challenge
</h3>
<p>
Life doesn&rsquo;t seem the same old drag anymore, problems are there as challenges;
some you win, some you lose, either way, you learn something. The only sad
thing is that over the last 8 months I seem to have had little time to do what I
want. I haven&rsquo;s tried any new hardware (except my new toy, more later). I
haven&rsquo;t written anything new of original, at least not Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini related,
and apart from mucking about on bulletin boards on occasion, the machine at home
has been collecting dust.
</p>
<p>
Well I suppose that&rsquo;s not true, I&rsquo;ve been carting an IBM AT home at weekends and
busily converting various bits of software from CP/M to MS-DOS. Nice bit of
software the Gemini IBMCOPY. I&rsquo;ve also been finding all the useful little tools
that I have been using on the old machine, for use on the new. This has been
leading up to something, and that is the acquisition of a new toy, a rather
smart Japanese IBM AT clone which arrived a couple of weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
I don&rsquo;t think it would be fair to say that I&rsquo;ve outgrown the Gemini/DH machine,
just that I need something to allow me to work at home without being
incompatible with the machines at work. Ok, so I could continue to drag one of
the works machines around after me, but that is dangerous. A real IBM AT with
frills still costs about four and a half grand, it also weighs about 50 pounds
(I think they include lead weights to help justify the cost). During that snowy
bit a few weeks back, I slipped whilst carrying one these machines from the car,
and although no harm was done, I had visions of the damage I might have done to
the machine, and even worse, the damage I could have done myself in trying to
catch it! No, the only answer was one of my own.

Hunt hunts the clone
</h3>
<p>
I went and shook the piggy bank, and found, lust enough in it (provided the
missus doesn&rsquo;t have funny ideas of trolling off to sunnier climes this summer,
and provided the guttering can be persuaded to stay in place one more year). So
off I went armed with the loot in search of my ideal machine. Nothing&rsquo;s easy is
