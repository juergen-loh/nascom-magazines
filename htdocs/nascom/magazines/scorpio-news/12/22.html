The diagram of Fig 1. shows the segments and buffers that would be present in a
Full implementation of 22 or 23, although the addresses are flexible, and the
size of the redirected I/O gegment is variable or nil

<p>
UsER areas and moving about.
</p>
<p>
The only way in which the software can be effectively controlled on # Winchester
drive de to use the USER facility of CP/M. To &laquo; non-technical user of the
Syste, {v appears that che Gia ie divided into a a
</p>
<p>
Father. how CP Pe
byte in the dicectory entry for any file 1a marked wich a number that may Dy
GBsH, which meune that the File is erased, or between 0 and OPW (O1FH = 2 aysten
Supports urers &pound;0 31).
</p>
<p>
This number indicates the USER
example by # DIR command, or be
</p>
<p>
n which the &pound;118 would be displayed for
yen&rsquo; by PIP command.
</p>
<p>
CP/M utilities are unable (in general) to access files not in their USER
The 2 system and its utilities have Buch greater ability however, and can reach
Across USER areas, EVEN on different drives. Thue commands Like:
</p>
<p>
AO&gt;DDIR C5: of &mdash;CADERA AZ:MYPILE.TXT
</p>
<p>
ace perfectly legal. The CP/M method of accessing an USER ari

which is much easier. The Mi

<p>
CoP and RCP Commands
</p>
<p>
The size Limitation of 2k restricts the 22 COP to virtually the same commands as
are provided with ZCPR/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CCPZ, and prevents the CCP from being able to deal vith
Named directories itself, pot does allow the movement described above. The USER
Command has been removed from 22 and 23 since it is redundant
</p>
<p>
The size problem ir overcome in 23 by providing #7 additional 2k Command package
inthe RCP segment. This brings several edvantages The number and power of
Gommands is extended. The RCP segment may be changed at any tame to being In
ther overlays with different features, The 23 CCP can optionally be assembled
tovdeal wath Named directories, Password protection of directories, minimize the
Seareh &ldquo;path, give preference to DU: forms or t0 DIR: forme {Le to Drive/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>User
Gr Named Forms) and so on &lsquo;Thi dncresses che amount of code eo the extent that
there is little room for the standard and extra commands Tt becomes a
balancing act, trying various TRUE or FALSE combinations until the minial
amount of memory it wasted in the CCP area, and then providing the remaining
Commands in ehe RCP
</p>
<p>
Options available in the CCP are DIR, LIST, TYPE, Go, ERA, SAVE, REN, GET, JUMP,
NOTE, In my system the 23 CCP provides ERA, SAVE, GO, and NOTE. GO will run
prograa in the TPA at loOH NOTE allows x Comment line to be displayed on the
BeREEN
</p>
<p>
AO&gt;NOTE This ie @ comment
AODNOTE A&rdquo; semicolon wil have the same effect
&lsquo;o&gt; Like this
</p>
<p>
The RCP segment&nbsp;.LIB source code, Like that for the CCP, will allow selection of
hore commands than will fit into 2k, so a compromise is necessary. In practice
thie ie not much of a problem. The commands available for selection are CP,
DIR, ERA, LIST, TYPE, PEEK, POKE, PROT, REG, REN, NOTE, ECHO, HL and WLQ
