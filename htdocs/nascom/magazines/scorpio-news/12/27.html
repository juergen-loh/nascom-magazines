copies, allowing disk changes en route, and it accepts a string of commands.
MCOPY, in common with most Z3 utilities, contains internal &lsquo;HELP&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>
<b>VFILER</b> provides an alternative file manipulation utility. The many varied
functions provided are reminiscent of SWEEP, but the system uses a pointer which
moves around the file lists displayed on the screen. Files are tagged and may
be copied, deleted, sized and so on. As with the other Z3 utilities, DIR: and
DU: forms are allowed. A &lsquo;?&rsquo; switches to a HELP page, and another &lsquo;?&rsquo; switches
back. VFILER supports the use of its own command files. One problem that I
have found with VFILER is that, unlike SWEEP or NSWP, the flies remain fully
tagged after an operation, so if one has forgotten to tag one or two for the
first operation, it is not possible to tag just those, copy or whatever and then
retag all, so flexibility suffers a little bit.

<h3>
Directory display and Maintenance&nbsp;&ndash;
</h3>
<p>
Beyond the simple displays provided by the DIR command of the CCP, RCP or
<b>DIR.COM</b>, two utilities are available for more sophisticated displays. <b>XD</b> and
<b>XDIR</b> have a large repertoire of options available, but even in the simple form
(i.e. no options), give a directory with very full information on files, sizes,
attribute bits, space taken by the selected files, space remaining on disk,
number of selected files, and number of files on disk. They also use the ENV
data to page the screen output. The XDIR utility in particular is very
powerful, allowing all users, disk output, acting as a file scanner and allowing
the display of files to be negated. XD and XDIR support printer output, display
format option and attribute display.
</p>
<p>
The ERA command of the CCP/RCP provides essential erase facility, and may be
assembled to allow verify or inspect operation. <b>ERASE.COM</b> backs up the CCP/RCP
ERA command, and greatly extends it. The user may opt to include &lsquo;SYSTEM&rsquo;
files, Read only Files, or to operate in an &lsquo;Inspect&rsquo; mode, with user input for
each file. Options may be mixed.
</p>
<p>
<b>UNERASE</b> will recover erased files, although the usual precautions are necessary.
It is always best to recover files IMMEDIATELY, if they are accidentally erased.
If several erased files of the same name exist in a directory, a by no means
unusual occurrence, it is better to use DU3 of SPZ to edit the directory
directly. Each occurrence of the file in turn can be recovered, to an &lsquo;empty&rsquo;
user area if possible, and then each one can be checked. It should be
remembered that a large file may have several entries in the directory for its
extends.
</p>
<p>
The file <b>CLEANDIR</b> can be used to clean up a directory from time to time. Users
of the SAP?? series from the CPMUG will be familiar with this operation. It
will sort the names into order (ascending or descending at the users option),
and rewrite the directory, removing all traces of erased file names. There is
no way to recover erased files after a CLEANDIR, but it is a good exercise,
because removal of the names of genuinely erased files gives a better chance of
restoring the correct file if an ERA error is made subsequently.
</p>
<p>
The REN command of the CCP/RCP is backed up by <b>RENAME.COM</b>, which allows batch
renaming of files, and supports control and inspect modes, and may be made to
work with system files and read only files.
</p>
<p>
<b>FINDF</b> is another useful program. If one cannot remember where a file is on any
drive on the system, FINDF will search for it and report all places where it is
found. N.B. ALL drives are searched, so if a disk is not mounted the
system will crash/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>hang. If a VDISK is in use and VFLIP operative FINDF gets
confused, and will not find files on the first half of the Winnie.
</p>
<h4>
Named Directories&nbsp;&ndash;
</h4>
<p>
The command <b>PWD</b> will list the current Named directories and their associated
DU&rsquo;s. This command may be made to display any associated Passwords, but ONLY if
the Wheel Byte is set to allow this.
