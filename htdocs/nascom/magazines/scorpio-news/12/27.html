VPILER provides an alternative file manipulation utility. The many varied
Functions provided are reminiscent of SWEEP, bat the system uses &amp; pointer which
moves around the file lists displayed on the seceen. Files are tagged and may

<p>
be copied, deleted, sized and coon As with the other Z3 utilities, DIR: and
DU: forms are allowed. A&lsquo;? switches to&rsquo;s HELP page, and another &ldquo;7&rdquo; evitches
back. VPILER supports the use of its own command files. One problem that
have found vith VFILER is that, unlike SWEEP or NSWP, the flies remain fully
</p>
<p>
tagged after en operation, so if one has forgotten to tag one or two for the
first operation, it is not possible to tag just those, copy or whatever and then
retag all, so flexibility suffers 2 litele bit.

Directory display and Maintenance &ndash;
</p>
<p>
Beyond the simple displays provided by the DIR command of the CCP, RCP or
DIE-COM, two utilities are avaliable for more sophisticated displays. XD. and
XDIR have a large repertoire of options available, but even in the simple form
(Le no options), give a directory with very full&rsquo; information on file
attribute bits, space taken by the selected files, space remaining
fumber of selected files, and number of files on disk: They aleo use the ENV
Gata to page the screen output. The XDIR utility in particular is very
powerful, &ldquo;eiowing all users, disk output, acting as a file scanner and allowing
fhe display of files to be negated XD ahd XDIR support prineer output, display
Format option and attribute display.

The ERA command of the CCP/RCP provides #ssential erase facility, and may be
assembled to allow verify or inspect operation. EBASE.COM backs up che CCP/RCP
ERA command, and greatly extends {t- The user gay Opt to include. &ldquo;SYSTEM
files, Read Gnly Files, of Co operate in an &ldquo;Inspect&rdquo; mode, vith user input for

&lsquo;The file CLEAMDIE can be uged to clean up a directory from time to time. Users
Of the SAP2? series from the CPHUG will be familiar with this operation It
Will sort the names into order (ascending or descending at the users option),
and reweite the directory, removing all traces of erased file names There is
ho way co recover erased files after a CLEANDIR, but it is a good exercise,
because removal of the names of genuinely erased files gives a batter chance of
Festoring the correct File if an ERA ecror is made eubsequently.

Tenaning of files, and supports control and (napect modes, tnd may be wade to
