About two years ago T upgraded my Nescom 2 by replacing the exteting drives with
Peouple of TEAC FD-Sseet they provided ay vystwa with a very worthwhile bee
in peftormance and disk capacity (From Unfortuaately hey sound
Llxe&rsquo;s couple of machine guns every time the disk heads moved. Altering the
stepping rete from 20 to 6 asec (#till twice the minimum for the TEAGS) reduced
the noise to&rsquo;s slightly Leve objectionable bucrrr.

DESCRIPTION
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;At about thie time, I learned that the never GM829 FDC board could support the
faster 3 mec stepping rate of modern floppy disk drives by doubling the clock
frequency into the FOE controller chip The GH829 board controle the FDC clock
frequency, amongst other things, by using the upper most bit (bit s) of a six
bit resetting latch Examining the M809 circuit diagram revealed that this
je bit ie present and uncommitted on the board. LK 1 on the GMOS provides a
ction of 3 clock frequencies, one of which ie selected by 4 soldered Link

close the awiteh Letting the clock pulser through to the output of the relevant
te. An inverter on the select Line (made from another NAND gate) ensures
that only one switch is open and the other closed at all times A fourth NAND
gate combines the outputs from the two digital ewitches nto a tingle oueput
