The ZCPR3 System by C. Bowden G30CB
Part 1 &ndash; ZCPR Concepts and Features
</p>
<p>
In Tetue 1 of Scorpio News I described some of the ways in which CP/M (Vers. 2)
could be improved. article T&rsquo;deveribed the ZCPR/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CCPZ Improved CCP, and
tioned the ZCPR2 and ZCPRS systems, I have now had a chatce to try
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;upgeades, and in this article I will describe the features of this
</p>
<p>
(high I wiil eal? 22 of 23 from here onwards.) I will alt
</p>
<p>
Some aspects of the various inscallation
</p>
<p>
explained in terms that

systen, and these options are nor alvays obvious. The installation information

<p>
also aceumes that the installer Aas the source code of hit BIOS available. Tt

<p>
{s&rsquo;poseible to inaeall 23 without thie code, and several ways around this
</p>
<p>
problem ave suggested
</p>
<p>
At the time that the article in Isque 1 was written, I did not have the most
Fecent CP/M User Group Library Catalogue, and the one chat I hed included the 22
disks 1 aeaumed that this was the most recent upgrade of the Z system, and
sent off my disks for the suite, (which occupies some 13 &ndash; Sin. dfake and is
Between 2&rsquo;and 3.Mb of software 1) Ivalso sent off for a new library caealogue.
When it came I found chat 23 vas available too. (Occupying enother 2-3 MB of
aise space) I probably drove poor bi ibs
</p>
<p>
many requests for copies, Anyway, Tc

<p>
Fefecences to 23 in the SB180 articles in BYTE, and ended up with &laquo; lot of dia
</p>
<p>
Full of programs.
</p>
<p>
There were a few weeks in between getting 22
the installation information with 22 ther more descriptl
ingealiation Less complex. Coming to 23 after 22 made the process much easier.
I&rsquo;think that lets experienced programmers starting straight off with 23 would
Find the task rather difficule

System Concepts
</p>
<p>
The original ZCPR/CCP2 brought the &lsquo;Path&rsquo; concept to CP/M, displayed the USER
umber in the Prompt, and displayed the name of files being erased, and added a
few extta useful features to CP/M which did greatly help make tho system aore
Eriendly. Further expacsion appeared to be restricted by the memory space
allocations The CCP and 00S sizes vere required to be kept to 2k and 3.sk for
Compatibility The BIOS was the only place where extra features could be sdde
but these would be system specific, such as the screen edit, paging and dump
features available in the US equipment
</p>
<p>
The Z systems were written by Richard Conn, in the USA, and made available to
all vin the CP/M User Group Network I do not know if other similar
</p>
<p>
exist for CP/M, but the main feature of the Z system is that it use
eaory ABOVE CP/M, thus retaining the unique structure of CP/M, and retaining
compacibility with virtually all software.
</p>
<p>
The penalty to be paid for this is one of reduced TPA. size 27 requires 300%
bytes extra for implementation which is not too bad, but 23 requires &lsquo;about 5-5k
for FULL implementation it should be made clear however that it is entisely
the dlacretion of the user or installer which features of 22 or 23 will by
Implemented, and which omitted Some features are virtually eerential even on c
fimall&rdquo; system ie. one wich say 2 floppy disks only, of about 300k capacity,
such # an Alphacronic PC, but others are auch more suited to a &lsquo;large&rsquo; syste
S&ldquo;Lles 10Mb Winchester, &lsquo;sizk Vdfsk, 2 &ndash; 800k floppies, Then again, some
Segments may be more or less desirable depending on the sort of application
The Flow Control Package and Redirected I/O Package might fall into thie
Category
</p>
<p>
around this problem could be to have eeveral operating systemy
</p>
<p>
one

</p>
<p>
available, froma &lsquo;No frills&rsquo; maximum TP.A CP/M where every bit of T.?.
