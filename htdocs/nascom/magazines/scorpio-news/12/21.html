seeded, to a full 23 system and Fancy 8105, for maximum flexibility, but with
the logs of say 6k of TPA.

Both 22 and 23 are supplied vith full source code for all of the software which
includes some sixty or seventy utilities that are able to use the special
features of their related Z system Tt also includes SYSLIB which ts # large
Library of subroutines that are used in the construction of the Z utilities, and
say alto be used in any other software that the user chooses. The user is thus
supplied with oil of the information needed to do whatever he likes.

23 ie upward compatible with 22, and so comments from her# on will generall.
relate to23 The three memory extensions above CP/M with 22 are the same a:
with 23.&rdquo; There ie one major difference which concerns the named directory
Factlicy &lsquo;The Named Directory segment of 72 is 200H bytes long. whereas that
with Z3 is only 100M bytes tong, (but could be made larger), and deals with 14
hanes In practice this seems adequate Also 2) itaeit ie not able touse or
Fecognize the names, whereas the 72 utilitie jeomed to&rsquo;me to be a
major deficiency of iz, on a Winchester based Floppy based syaten,
where the media is continually changing, nanes ace perhaps of limited use.
Sepecially on systems where the disks are under say s0dk. (Although the eystes
allows che directory segment to be easily changed, and so a new one could be
Toaded for each application.)
