Wot really, just a few comments on the content of issue 1. Quite &laquo; lot of it
vasnie really directly concerned with the hardware Listed on the front cover of
The magazine. In particular, there were a lot of pages about Fortran, &amp;
Language that should have died out youre ago. And Dave Hunt&rsquo;s dictionary was
rather incomplete. Items of this nature should be up to date, and include
Gefinitions relating to important languages Like Pascal. You know the sort of
thing T mean, &ldquo;Recureion, see recursion&rdquo;

Installing HDsO for use with the SVC.
</p>
<p>
EDS is the progcam editor T use, which {s suppiied with
Language Hisoft produce Iv comes with an installation prog
tiser to set it up for a particular system&rsquo;s display hardware, and very good it
Uet"eo0., What st doesn&rsquo;t dois word processing, with the vord-veapping and
justification tha implies. Programs tend not eo need that sort of thing.

When 1 finished installing mine, following the instcuctions carefully (and the
manual does explain the process clearly), I found I had a problem The SVC was
Rot showing any cursor &lsquo;After a few minutes trying to work by pressing a key
fand watching where # character appeared, I decided Thad to do something.&raquo; Going
back to the manual, T Found out how to get EDO to send an initialisation string
fo the SVC, and set it up to enable the cursor, in the form of a flashing block:
Whappen to prefer that sort to the more weual underline character. on running
EDGO there wee ay flashing cursor blob | However, as soon ae T touched a Fe
it vanished, Further investigation suggested that CP/M wee resetting it to ti
original invisible type for inscrutable reasons of ite own. So T dug out the
Ch/H BIOs Liscings, and found the routine that was doing it I made a CP/M with
that routine eemoved, and can EDSO again The cursor still vanished ag soon as
in wan moved from the top left of the screen. T went to the pub
</p>
<p>
In the end, 1 had @ look at the code of E080, using Hisoft&rsquo;s MON COM utility,
and found that being Jolly good chaps, and tidy progranmers, they had routed all
calls to the CP/M screen writing routine to a single routine of their own. Even
better, there vere useful areas of zeros dn the progeam, whith looked as if &amp;
patch ingerted in them would do no harm. So I cobbled together a patch, and put
