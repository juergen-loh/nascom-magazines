Could somebody ple:

answer a couple of questions involving the disk routines
</p>
<p>
2) Why are Shugart $4200 drives only allowed 64 directory entries?
2) Why te veide nibbling* allowed only under Gemini DD format with PERTEC
drives? I&rsquo;m using # Miteubishl drive and a Pertec drive and it works Just
well on the Mitsubishi as the Pertec, Algo why didn&rsquo;t Gemini keep the
</p>
<p>
jove format for 96tpi drives?

1) I seem to remember that the Shugart $A200 was an 8* drive. In that case
the cwason for the 64 dicectory entries ie because that. w
OBiu dick format standard. In fact 6s is quite
entries for # disk capacity of about 250K.
</p>
<p>
2) Tassume &ldquo;aide nibbling&rsquo; means putting data on both sides before moving on
ta&rsquo;the next track This improves performance The reavon it wat used for
the Gemini 00/DS8 acpi format and not for ehe Lacer 96epl (80 track)
Formate is that the firet Geain! double denaity ubtpi formet was double
sided, whereas the {iret Gemini 96tpi format weed tingle sided drives
Naturally Gealni decided to use a format which would allow doch single snd
double sided drives to be used, vith single sided disks being immediately
readable on the later double sided drives. In fact this required the
Sadicional forward thinking precaution of Using 4K allocation blocks
</p>
<p>
The question of using Mitsubish: drives instead of Pertec appears to relate
to&rdquo; che use of *Pertec&rdquo; in early documentation &ndash; probably before alternate
Suppliert existed. ft will work just ae well on compatible untes
