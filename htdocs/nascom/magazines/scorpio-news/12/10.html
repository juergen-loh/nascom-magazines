from the system Clock. If the System Clock is being used, it is routed through
a prescaler, where it is divided by either 16 of 256. The counter can be set to
count down from any number between 256 and 1. On reaching zero, the channel
sends out a pulse on its Zero Count/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Time Out (ZC/TOn) pin, except for channel 3
which lacks that pin. The counter can be caused to automatically reload the
initial count everytime it reaches zero. The important event is the counter
reaching zero, which can cause an output pulse on the ZC/TOn pin, an automatic
reload of the counter ready to go again, end an interrupt if required.
</p>
<p>
The <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC", "CTC", ""); ?>, being capable of vectored interrupts is best used in that mode. A
typical example ia the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 CPU","MAP CPU"); ?> board, where channel 3 of the on-board CTC is
configured to interrupt when the keyboard has a character ready. This is done
by telling the CTC channel 4 that it is to count 1 transition on the CLK/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TRG3
pin (the keyboard strobe), cause an interrupt, and automatically reload the
count ready to go again.
</p>
<p>
In programming the CTC for a system using vectored interrupts, we must therefore
supply a valid interrupt vector. This is the lowest of four consecutive slots
in the interrupt service table, and is passed to channel 0. Channel 0
reorganises it as an interrupt vector because the lease three bits are 0&nbsp;&ndash;
typically the form of this vector is:
</p>
<?php imageCenter($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-10-1.png"); ?>
<p>
where the least byte of the address of the four word section of the interrupt
table is V7V6V5V4V3000. Bite 2-0 are modified by the CTC adding in 000 for
Channel 0, 010 for channel 1, 100 for channel 2 and 110 for channel 3, depending
which originates the interrupt.
</p>
<p>
Then to program a channel of the CTC, a control byte and associated but optional
parameters are written to the Channel Control Register. Each channel of the CTC
can be programmed independently of the others. The channel recognises the
control byte because bit 0 is always 1. The other seven bits of the control
byte define differing alternatives from the channel&rsquo;s operating modes. These
bits have the following meanings:
</p>
<?php imageCenter($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-10-2.png"); ?>
<p>
These bits have the following meaning
