<p>
The need to be able make such modifications to the BIOS, and Cold Boot
initialization routines again underlines the need for system suppliers to make
the BIOS source code available to users.

<h3>
External File Control Block.
</h3>
<p>
Use of the external FCB releases more room in the CCP area for commands, and
provides Z system utilities with a means of accessing the data and using it.
Only 48 bytes are used by this buffer.
</p>
<h3>
Message Buffers.
</h3>
<p>
This area uses only 80 bytes, and the author of Z3 emphasizes the need to instal
this feature if Z3 is to work properly. The area is used to convey system
information between Z3 and utilities.
</p>
<h3>
Shell stack.
</h3>
<p>
The shell stack uses 128 bytes of memory. Z3 supports the use of Shells, and
the Shell Stack is necessary for this feature to be used.
</p>
<p>
I must admit to being unfamiliar with shells, and I quote from the Z3
documentation&nbsp;&ndash; &lsquo;A Shell is a front end processor which is invoked in place of
the Z3 CCP input routine, allowing command input to proceed in a variety of
different, perhaps more user friendly ways.&rsquo;. Programs that are configured as
shells lie in memory rather like the layers in an onion&nbsp;&ndash; one above the other,
rather than replacing one another, so that control can be passed from one to the
other. Thus MENU, which is a shell can run another shell like VFILER. When
VFILER is exited, control would revert to MENU.

<h3>
The Environment Descriptor.
</h3>
<p>
This segment takes up 256 bytes of memory, but is essential if the Z system is
to operate. It consists of two parts, each of which is allocated 128 bytes.
One part describes the Z3 environment itself. It holds the addresses of all of
the active segments and buffers so that Z3 and utilities know what is available
and where to find it. It also contains some general data about Terminals and
Printers, such as Screen Width, Screen Lines, Printer Width, Form Feed
supported, and so on. Two terminals and four printers may be described.
</p>
<p>
The other part, called the TCAP&nbsp;&ndash; Terminal Capabilities, describes the special
features of the system screen handling such as Cursor Key bytes, Cursor movement
Byte string, Inverted Video Commands, Clear Screen and Line. These are then
available to the Z system utilities, which can then use the features for better
user interface. Z3 comes with a large library of Terminals described, but the
Gemini
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>/<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
is not amongst them. It is quite easy to set up an ENV segment
for any terminal however. There are over 80 bytes free in this part of the .ENV
segment, which may be utilized in other ways, as suggested in the installation
part of this article.
</p>
<h3>
Flow Command Package.
</h3>
<p>
This is another area of Z3 that I have not yet investigated to any extent. This
segment takes 512 bytes of memory. It provides a number of conditional commands
like IF, ELSE, FI, XIF that allow command sequences to be conditional. A
command like:
