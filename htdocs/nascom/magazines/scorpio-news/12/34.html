Datic research a month or s0 before, for something T vas up to. None the 1

MAP back in the fold, and I understand there will be a couple of useful articles
Coming up about some of their products which I confess 1 Know very Little about.
Dr&rdquo; Dark, of course, comes across strongly as usual, and so did Paddy Coker

As theeatened in my last offering I have had to defect (this veek) to the ranks
Of IBM clone owners, ec there wee a Limit to the amount of work-vork 1 could do
Bt home on my trusty old Cemini/DH machine (it had been reduced to producing
Gocumentation, and very Little else). Now T know any defection from the rank!
is sad, but In my case it&rsquo;s a case of expediency. If ay family expect me to
continue to earn the daily bread, then unfortunately, I must have the correct
tools for the Job.
