To disable a <?php externalLink("Z80 CTC", "CTC", ""); ?> channel from causing an interrupt, the code is simple. Just
write a 01H to the appropriate channel. Like the other Z80 chips, it is
necessary to disable the system interrupts in case an interrupt occurs while the
disable instruction is being assimilated by the I/O chip. The code is only
slightly more complex than above:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
LD   A, 01h
DI             ; Disable CPU interrupts
OUT (CTCn),A   ; Disable CTC channel
EI             ; re-enable CPU interrupts
</pre>
<p>
A channel may not begin operations in any mode unless a valid time constant byte
has been written into the Time Constant Register. This byte is expected on the
next write to the channel in question following the write of the channel control
byte, provided the channel control byte had bit 2 set (= 1). If this time
constant byte is 0 it is interpreted as 256. If a new time constant byte
written to a channel already in operation, the new time constant byte is only
reloaded at the next count down to zero.
</p>
<p>
The major difference between Counter mode and Timer mode is that Counter mode
uses the external clock or pulse provided on the CLK/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TRGn pin, whereas the Timer
mode uses the system clock, divided by the prescaler (either 16 or 256 according
to the setting of bit 5 of the channel control byte). In timer mode, the timing
operation can be programmed to start from an external trigger to the CLK/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TRGn
pulse, or almost immediately from the system signals. The external starting
trigger is usually not required, and the reader is referred to the
manufacturer&rsquo;s data sheets for more precise details. It is also possible to
define whether the trigger or count decrement takes place on the rising or
falling edge of the timing clock (Bit 4). One constraint that is not very
openly defined is to be found in the technical details of the data sheet; this
states that the maximum frequency to be applied to the CLK/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>TRGn pin is to be
half of the system clock. This means that on a 4MHz system, the maximum
external clock to the CHC is to be 2&nbsp;MHz.
</p>
<p>
Now for a worked example. In the case of a standard
<?php externalLink("MAP80 CPU","MAP CPU",""); ?>, we wish to set up
the CTC as follows:
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>CTC0</td><td>is to drive SIO channel A to receive/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>transmit at 1200&nbsp;baud</td></tr>
<tr><td>CTC1</td><td>is to drive SIO channel B to receive/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>transmit at 300&nbsp;baud</td></tr>
<tr><td>CTC2</td><td>is not used</td></tr>
<tr><td>CTC3</td><td>is to receive the strobe from the keyboard, and to interrupt on each
		key</td></tr>

Rather than give a full listing of code, I will use the method set out in
<a href="../../14/text/#ref5">[5]</a>
for I/O port initialization, with comments beside the relevant bytes to explain
how they are arrived at. These initialization tables are set out like this:
