<p>
using software, we reconfigure the CTC to use the divider mode and system clock
for 1200/75&nbsp;baud, and the counter mode and external clock for the faster
baudrate of 9600.

<p>
The configuration tables for the CTC are:

<p>
To switch between 1200/75 and 75/1200 takes a little more work &ndash; I had to design
a patch for my MODEM, and for CP/M Plus, but it is possible. I hope that this
long rambling article will persuade others to try using an unused channel of
their CTC &ndash; it is a most useful chip. I know of one system where an unused CTC
bas employed to provide dooropen interrupts for three drives, and the fourth
channel was used to provide a real time clock interrupt to update the on screen
date and time every five seconds.

<p>
In the next article, I&rsquo;ll write about the SIO and its programming.
