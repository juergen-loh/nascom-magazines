5) Insulate the free end of the LED with some heat shrink sleeving or a spare
piece of PVC tubing
</p>
<p>
6) Finally double check the wiring.

This completes the modification. Depending on the type of LED used, you may
need to adjust the value of the 330 ohm resistor, but try to keep the current
below 8mA.

<h3>
TESTING
</h3>
<p>
Re-install the card and switch on. The LED should be off. If you have a BIOS
that supports a RAM-disk on the MAP RAM card (e.g. SYS) then boot it up and
watch the results. If not then use the Monitor ROM to output values to port
0FEh.

<h3>
CONCLUSION
</h3>
<p>
The modification will work for both NASCOM&nbsp;2 and GM811 users. I have
successfully used it for the past year with no problems at all. Unfortunately
the modification is not suitable for GM813 users who are using the MAP RAM board
in its memory mapping mode. Additional logic is needed to detect when the
extended address lies outside the first 64K (0 &ndash; FFFFh) i.e when address lines
A16-A19 are all zero.
