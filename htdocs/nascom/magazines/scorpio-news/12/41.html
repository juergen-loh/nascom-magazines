Hex characters on the left. A full stop is used to show unprintable characters.

The format for the directory entry corresponds almost exactly to that of a CP/M
file control block and for good reason. Apart from the first byte, the
directory entry is a direct copy of the first 32 bytes of the FCB.
</p>
<p>
The disk directory information is stored on the data tracks of the disk (as
opposed to the system tracks) and occupies the first one or two (usually) blocks
on the disk. Each directory entry requires 32 bytes and so it follows that for
a 1K Block size, each block will hold 32 directory entries. If you should wish
to double the number of directory entries available to 64, then 2 blocks will
have to be set aside for the directory. Therefore, the number of directory
entries available and consequently the maximum number of files that may be
stored on a disk is a trade off against the size of the disk and the number of
blocks that can be spared for directory information. Gemini opted for 128
directory entries per disk with a 4K block size, so only one block is lost to
the directory leaving 196 blocks for the files themselves.

<p>
Looking at the entry for TESTFILE.COM, the first byte tells us that the file is
stored in user area 0. The user number is held in the lover four bits of the
byte. The upper four bits are reserved by Digital Research and although they
are unused in CP/M versions up to 2.2, CP/M&nbsp;3 does use them so, if anyone was
thinking of having 256 user areas, think again if you wish to remain compatible
with future releases of CP/M.
</p>
<p>
A value of 0E5H in this position indicates to the BDOS that the file has been
erased. This makes utilities such as <span class="uppercase">Unerase</span> possible as, to restore a file,
all that is necessary is to change this byte to a value between 0 and 15
depending upon which user area is required co hold the file. Unfortunately,
this may not always work as if a file has been written to the disk since
erasure, some of the data blocks used in the erased file may have been
reallocated to the new file. For users of CP/M&nbsp;1.4, it is not possible to
unerase a file as the ERA command completely wipes the directory entries for the
erased file by filling them with 0E5H bytes.
</p>
<p>
CP/M&nbsp;3 uses different values of the first byte of the directory entry to
identify disk labels, password information and date/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>time stamps, all of which
occupy directory space and consequently reduce the number of files that may be
stored on the disk. The disk Label occupies one directory entry and may be
identified by a 20H value for the first byte. Date/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Time stamps and passwords
are invoked by formatting the directory using the utility INITDIR.COM which
reserves one directory entry for every three file entries in the directory;
reserved entries being identified by the value 21H in their first byte. You
will see that if Date/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Time stamping is invoked under CP/M&nbsp;3, the maximum number
of files that may be stored on the disk it immediately reduced by one quarter.
</p>
<p>
Next in the directory entry comes the 11 bytes for the file name and type. The
last four bytes in the top row give file size information and will be looked at
later. Lastly, the 16 bytes in the bottom row contain the block numbers that
have been allocated to the file. CP/M gets clever here and the block numbers
are stored differently depending on whether the disk has more than 255 or less
than 256 blocks available. If there are less than 256 blocks on the disk, CP/M
stores the block numbers as 8 bit values and can consequently hold information
on 16 blocks. If, however, the disk has 256 of more blocks, the numbers are
stored as 16 bit values (stored in Low-High order) with the result that only 8
blocks may be allocated per directory entry. In the example given we can see
that only one block has been allocated to the file although it isn&rsquo;t apparent
from the entry whether 8 or 16 bit numbers are being used. The decision as to
whether 8 or 16-bit numbers are used is made by the CP/M BDOS and is totally
transparent to the user but the manufacturers of the Tatung Einstein force their
implementation of CP/M to use 16 bit values, even though their disks have less
than 256 blocks. This, presumably, was an attempt to make their disks
unreadable on other systems (Didn&rsquo;t fool Dave Hunt though).
