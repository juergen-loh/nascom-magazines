Wha CP/M doesn&rsquo;t know is which records have been written to the block; this ie
Left for the programmer to determin

<p>
one vay of doing this {s to use the write random with zero 111 function when
weiting to 4 previously unallocated block. To establish, from within &laquo; progran,
hatnge or not&rsquo;a bigck has bean allocated to&rsquo;s file ta to read the desired
Fecord using the read rand
trying to read a block tha 7
Felevant position in the directory entry.

Tocated which could contain the. wanted record. If you previously weed
ro Fil function when writing &laquo; record to this block, examination of the
contents of the cequired record will reveal zeros 1f nothing has been written to
Stor data 18 something hav been written.
</p>
<p>
A point vorth noting is that the CP/M DIR command will only show a file if
aurectory entry exitte for extent 0. For thie reason, writing one Fecord to
Fecord position 63535, for example, will result in two directory entries being
Greaved; an empty one covering extent 0 and one covering the 128th record of
extent 512

<p>
Another observation about random files {a the vay that PIP.COM handles them (or
more accurately, it doesn&rsquo;t). PIP,COM reade and writes files sequentially and
Will thecefore get an end of file code from the BDOS when it encounters an
Unallocated block ina file. Normally, this vould be adequate ae most files
indeed end thie vay If faced with the example of a file that contains only
record 65535, PIP.COM will only copy the empty directory entry for extent &copy;

The disk routines in the BX

contain data areas and buffer epace that will be
used by the BDOS when it needs to have information that is system dependent.
These areas ave known as the Disk Parameter Headere (DPil&rsquo;s), Disk Parameter
Blocks &ldquo;(DPB&rsquo;s}, Checksum Vectors and Allocation Vectors We&rsquo;ll Look at these in
