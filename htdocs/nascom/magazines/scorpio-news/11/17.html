DATA FROM
EXPERIMENT 1   (assuming that L had a value of 1)

<p>
F80 and ProFortran recognise ten different types of I/O field descriptor:
</p>
<table class="for-formats">
<tr><td>A</td><td>Alphanumeric [A &ndash; Z, 0 &ndash; 9 etc.]</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>Double precision numeric</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>Exponent form [e.g. 1.1E04 = 11,000]</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>Floating point [e.g. 12.34)</td></tr>
<tr><td>G</td><td>(can be used for floating point or exponent)</td></tr>
<tr><td>H</td><td>Hollerith (string)</td></tr>
<tr><td>(or) &nbsp; '</td><td>alternative to Hollerith</td></tr>
<tr><td>I</td><td>Integer data [e.g. 12, 560)</td></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>Logical [T(rue) c F(alse)] &ndash; not often used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>optional scaling descriptor used with D,E,F and G
				conversions either as a multiple or a fraction</td></tr>
<tr><td>X</td><td>blank space</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
These are fairly standard for most FORTRANs but NFortran does not have Double
Precision or the scaling descriptor P. It does have T (tabulation), K
(hexadecimal) and Z (inhibit &lt;cr,lf&gt; on output) which might be useful.
</p>
<p>
Most users will only be concerned with A,E,F,H,I and X descriptors; apart from
the H and X descriptors, which have the general forms nH or nX where n is the
number of columns each descriptor covers, the rest have the operational form rZy
where r is the number of repetitions of the field descriptor if this it grater
than 1, Z is the descriptor type and y giver information about the total width
of field required for each repetition.
</p>
<p>
Some examples would not come amiss here &ndash;
</p>
<table class="format-examples">
<tr><td>10A4</td><td>indicates 10 alphanumeric fields each 4 columns wide</td></tr>

<tr><td>E8.2</td><td>indicates 1 exponent field 8 columns wide, where there are two
			figures after the decimal point. Thus 12345.67 is represented
			as 0.12E&macr;05 (where the &macr; represents a blank column in which
			nothing is printed)</td></tr>

<tr><td>E12.5</td><td>is a single exponent field of 12 columns in which 5 figures
			follow the decimal point and a figure such as &ndash;12.345678 would
			be represented as &ndash;0.12345E&macr;02. This implies that the number
			is truncated (shortened) and loses some accuracy.</td></tr>

<tr><td>F3.0</td><td>shows that a floating point number occupying 3 columns is
			involved which has no significant numbers to the right of the
			decinal point, 7.0 er 2.0 would be shown in this way</td></tr>

<tr><td>F8.4</td><td>shows that the floating point (real) number occupies 6 columns
			and has 4 digits to the right of the decimal point. 123.4567
			is a suitable example: a real number such as &ndash;34.89088 would
			be shown as 34.8909, since the field only permits a maximum
			of 4 digits after the decimal point. Overflow can occur if the
			number of digits to the left of the decimal point cannot be
			fitted into the space available &ndash; thus 1234.56 would be
			printed as *.56 &ndash; the asterisk shows that the field width was
			too small.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4I3</td><td>indicates that there are four 3 digit integer fields involved;
			thus 123, 245, 778 and 200 are represented as: 123245778200
			while &ndash;30, 2, 45 and 559 are represented by &ndash;30 &nbsp; 2 45559. In
			the latter case, the &lsquo;&ndash;&rdquo; sign occupies 1 of the columns in its
			field and the numbers with less than 3 digits are right
			justified</td></tr>

<tr><td>4X</td><td>this shows that 4 columns are to be skipped (not read or
			printed)</td></tr>
