Disk Formats and CP/M Disk Routines by M.W.T. Waters

(4, &ndash; eis article runs to some twenty plus pages in total. I have therefore
split it up, and this is the first part, concentrating on the format that data
Ee actually writeen onto disks in.)
</p>
<p>
Have you ever wondered about how CP/M stores avay its data, how the dicectory
records relate to the filed on disk, what deteruines the miniaum and maximum
File sizes or what determines disk size and the number of directory entries
available?
</p>
<p>
There are several good books available about CP/M but none of them appear to
Cater for the dabbler in operating system software or for the type of hacker&rdquo;
best described as an 80-808 user. The Digital Research handbooks contain all of
gata required for jlement CP/M on a microcomputer but
rarely explain WHY a particular disk parame yy, fe given # specific value
or HOW fe fits into the great scheme of thin

I should mention here that I was introduced to computers when hackers were
(mainly) electronics enthusiasts who built computer systems from scratch and
Caught theneelves programming dy sheer hard work combined with more than 8

&mdash; Little trial&rsquo; and erroc These days, hacking seens to apply to juveniles
(generaily) who illegally enter other peoples computer eystens and create a bed
name for home computer users.

Most of the information contained in this article Ls available to the average
&lsquo;0-BUS user who 1a armed with @ disassenbler, the CP/M manuals and lots of time
and patience (or as someone else put it, &ldquo;Stupidity and sheer bloody
nundedness").

Disks and disk formate
</p>
<p>
Before proceeding with an in-depth breakdon of CP/M, I shall describe, briefl}
Floppy disks and floppy disk formats and thea go on to examine the di
phyfitally vestven to the disk surface during formatting. The examples given
Will be oriented towards the current Gemini 5.25" disk formats but will be
Squally applicable &lsquo;co any IBM&nbsp;3740 or IBM&nbsp;34 type disk format (eg Natcom)

A floppy disk consists of a disc of thin mylar (a flexible plastic) that has
been costed on both aides with ferrous oxide; the same eateriel that 19 used to
coat magnetic recording tape The disk surface itself is contained in and
protected by a covering of some sort with cut-outs to allow access for the
Fead/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>write head(s) of the disk drive Disks are available in four sizes: 8&rsquo;,
Sczst, 3.&rdquo; ands&rdquo; wien 825&rdquo; being the most commonly used by microcomputer
manufacturers. In the case of 8 and 5.25" diske, the covering (known a the
envelope) ia made of cardboard while the other two sizes are protected by a
Figid plastic case.

disks may be either single or double sided, Disk drives that are deeigned for
Single sided opecacion only have one head while those designed for double sided
ion have one head for each side of the disk However, with early 3&rsquo; disk

type of disk appears to be two separate disks joined back Co back,

<p>
From this point on, I shall only refer to 5.257 disks but the principles
involved are very similar co the other types The disk surface is divided up
into 4 number of tracks at the time of formatting; the number of tracks
depending upon the disk size and the physical chacacteristics of the disk drive
The read/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>write head ie permitted to access each track by stepping the head in or
