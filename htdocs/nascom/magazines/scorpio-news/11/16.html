The Logical Unie Numbers referr

<p>
to above are normally asrigned as follows:
</p>
<p>
Unite 1, 3, 4 and $ are assigned to the console/VDU; Unit 2 Le assigned to the
printer &lsquo;Units 6 &ndash; 10 are assigned to disk files. Units 11 &ndash; 235 may be
Bseigned as the user wishes (and units 1-10 may sito be re-assigned if you
really vant tol)

<p>
For most purposes the default assignments will be found adequate but for further
information, the appropriate reference manual ust be consulted

&lsquo;A typical READ statement will Look Like
</p>
<p>
READ(S.35) Rob
35 FORHAT(I3,2%,14)
</p>
<p>
An which two data entries, K and L are read in from the keyboard with field
widths of 3 and 4 respectively, separated by a blank field of 2 spaces. The
Seme holds for a WRITE statement since, if it is in the same program subroutine,
</p>
<p>
WRITE(2,35) KL.
</p>
<p>
will cause the values of K and L to be output on the printer, starting in column
Yland separated by 2 spaces Statement numbers muse not be duplicated in the
game sutcoutine but more than one READ/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>WRITE statement may reference &amp; given
FORMAT statement

Alphanumeric text material (letters, symbols and figures) may be used as progr:
I/O by means of a FORMAT statement in one of two ways which employ Hollerith
field descriptors the first (and less convenient) method involves the

Durput = tedious for ong tities, while the other simply involves placing the
entire text between single quotes {") | In both cases, che program statement

Continuation line if used, The statements

<p>
are treated in the same vay by the compiler but the first uses the Hollerith (H)
field width desceipror &ndash; 20 unite wide in this cage ond the game as the text
including spaces while the second uses single quotes as text delimiters &ndash; a lot
easler to use!&rdquo; The expressions mean &ldquo;write to # disk file the text followed by
the current value of the variable L&rsquo;

<p>
fon both input and output, text can be split between Lines by using the solidu
