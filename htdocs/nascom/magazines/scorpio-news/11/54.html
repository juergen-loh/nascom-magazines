Customizing the CBIOS

The CBIOS i the ar

Well, 1 found that I just could not put up with &laquo;
Ahead, no&rsquo; screen dump, no acreen editing, Limited py
function key support, no backspace key, Kept changing &lsquo;care&rsquo;, and had partly ROH
Daved BIOS,&rdquo; The supporting utilities for copying and formatting were not very
good either &ndash; pretey screen displays, but no verification, ao information on
Progress, and a bug or two. At least when I sold it it had CCPZ and some public
Gomein utilities co help. It made me realize just vhat some people have to put
up with

lable for the Nasbus/80-BUS machines. 1 have
(SYS) and MAPBO_5; T have no
Knowledge of P/M B105"s to T cannot comment on th fg three. BIOS&rdquo;
mentioned are all very good and provide features that ee, Lf not unique
Bie CP/M machines, Fortunately, MAP and SYS BIOS&rsquo;s come/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>came with source
(Unfortunately SYS cannot now &lsquo;be purchased, but I believe that there are
quite &laquo; few about.)
</p>
<p>
If T can ride one of my hobby-horses here &ndash; Whilet I fully understand
problems of copyright and pirating, I feel that it 4 &laquo; completely retrogr!
Step to withhold the BIOS source code from system purchat &lsquo;The vast majority
Of users are being penalized for the sake of the oud dishonest person who could
</p>
<p>
probably be dealt with effectively by the lav anyway. I feel that piracy is
Being made the excuse for trying to prevent people from expanding their syst
except the Gemini way SYS at one stage included Winchester #upport, but later
</p>
<p>
thie had to be removed. (Because users didn&rsquo;t need to go to Cemini for a new
BIOS or to buy a Winchester?) Then SYS iteeif was withdravn because of
Copyright. problems. (See App. 2 Ref 4)
</p>
<p>
The new GM8c9 card seems to
recently wanted to purchase spare
</p>
<p>
to be # similar cf
Controller card for severa!
</p>
<p>
that fe would
fon the machines in question cannot be easily replaced due to special custom
Foutines, so 7 will have to try to alter the CBI0S to support the 849. This
Sort of work I can do without,
</p>
<p>
Logically one vould expect that Genins would vant to offer the best BIOS
available, but their BIOS does not include a number of ueful features such
Tocked EDIT and extended Screen Paging, and vithout the source code, it is of
course imposrible to customize it for additional features such as Clock support,
or the type of keyboard feature described later Neither are HAP product
Supported, again denying users of the BUS the mort flexible system. Once one it
accustomed to such Features, it would be difficult to return to &laquo; 810s without
them appreciate that there must be limits to what can be provided &laquo;
Sconric&rdquo; options, but I do not see that as any reason to deny the users der
CUSTOMERS, the facility to do their own customizing,
</p>
<p>
Fortunately I have any of the features of SYS wit!
the MAP CP/M 2.2 B108, own routines to provid
myself vith the features that T want. (For pervonal use only ) Customization
Tike this takes &laquo; lot of time though, and obviously would not be posible for
many users, even if the required source codes are available. The restrictive
Approach must be denying users the best operating environment, and this could be
Getrimencel in the long run.
