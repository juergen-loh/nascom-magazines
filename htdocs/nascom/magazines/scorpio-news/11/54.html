<h3>
Customizing the CBIOS
</h3>
<p>
The CBIOS is the area where most can be done to make CP/M more user
friendly. I recently bought an Alphatronic PC &ndash; A Z80 CP/M machine that was
very well made and selling at a bargain price. I had thought that it would be
useful as a second machine. I kept it for about six month, and then sold it to
a friend who had previously been using a PET. He thinks that it is fabulous, so
why did I sell it? (I did put CCPZ onto it.)
</p>
<p>
Well, I found that I just could not put up with a machine that had no Type
Ahead, no screen dump, no screen editing, limited paging (from CCPZ), limited
function key support, no backspace key, kept changing &lsquo;care&rsquo;, and had partly ROM
based BIOS. The supporting utilities for copying and formatting were not very
good either &ndash; pretty screen displays, but no verification, no information on
progress, and a bug or two. At least when I sold it it had CCPZ and some public
domain utilities to help. It made me realize just what some people have to put
up with.
</p>
<p>
A number of BIOS&rsquo;s are available for the Nasbus/80-BUS machines. I have
used BIOS&rsquo;s by Gemini, Richard Beal (SYS) and MAP80 Systems. I have no
knowledge of Nascom CP/M BIOS&rsquo;s so T cannot comment on them. The three. BIOS&rsquo;s
mentioned are all very good and provide features that are rare., if not unique,
on 8 Bit CP/M machines. Fortunately, MAP and SYS BIOS&rsquo;s come/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>came with source
code. (Unfortunately SYS cannot now be purchased, but I believe that there are
quite a few about.)
</p>
<p>
If I can ride one of my hobby-horses here &ndash; Whilst I fully understand the
problems of copyright and pirating, I feel that it it is a completely retrograde
step to withhold the BIOS source code from system purchasers. The vast majority
of users are being penalized for the sake of the oud dishonest person who could
probably be dealt with effectively by the law anyway. I feel that piracy is
being made the excuse for trying to prevent people from expanding their systems
except the Gemini way. SYS at one stage included Winchester support, but later
this had to be removed. (Because users didn&rsquo;t need to go to Gemini for a new
BIOS or to buy a Winchester?) Then SYS itself was withdrawn because of
Copyright. problems. (See App. 2 Ref 4)
</p>
<p>
The new
<?php externalLink("GM849"); ?>
card seems to me to be a similar case in some ways. I
recently wanted to purchase a spare Disk Controller card for several machines at
work that are in heavy use, and I was annoyed to find that the GM849 card that
supercedes the
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
needs version 3.4 of the BIOS to run it. (When the CP/M
was upgraded to Version 3.2 BIOS at work a few month ago there was no mention
that it would not drive the 849 &ndash; nor was there a mention of the 849). The CP/M
on the machines in question cannot be easily replaced due to special custom
routines, so I will have to try to alter the CBIOS to support the 849. This
sort of work I can do without.
</p>
<p>
Logically one would expect that Gemini would want to offer the best BIOS
available, but their BIOS does not include a number of uesful features such as
locked EDIT and extended Screen Paging, and without the source code, it is of
course impossible to customize it for additional features such as Clock support,
or the type of keyboard feature described later. Neither are MAP products
supported, again denying users of the BUS the most flexible system. Once one it
accustomed to such features, it would be difficult to return to a BIOS without
them appreciate that there must be limits to what can be provided as
&lsquo;CONFIG&rsquo; options, but I do not see that as any reason to deny the users ie:
CUSTOMERS, the facility to do their own customizing.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately I have been able to combine many of the features of SYS with
the MAP CP/M&nbsp;2.2 BIOS, and the added in some of my own routines to provide
myself with the features that I want. (For personal use only.) Customization
like this takes a lot of time though, and obviously would not be possible for
many users, even if the required source codes are available. The restrictive
approach must be denying users the best operating environment, and this could be
detrimental in the long run.
