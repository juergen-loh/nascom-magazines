As you can see from the earlier paragraphs, I was a &lsquo;bit miffed&rsquo; at the turn
of events last May, since then I haven&rsquo;t had the time to worry about such
things, I&rsquo;ve been too busy learning and revising my opinions. That doesn&rsquo;t mean
I&rsquo;ve deserted my trusty Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>DH machine at home, but it does mean that
I&rsquo;ve spent a considerable amount of time investigating the performance (or in
most instances, the lack of) of various IBM micros and their clones. Because
that&rsquo;s what sells (in quantity) whilst Geminis don&rsquo;t (in quantity).

The recent experience with other machines has also opened my eyes to the
good points and failings of the more popular competition, but even more so to
the lost opportunities and ostrich like behaviour of many UK companies to adapt
to the wind of change, however unsavioury that wind might be. Unfortunately the
architecture philosophy of the IBM type machine is with us, and with us for
a good many years to come; despite, I suspect, that IBM have only recently
realized what a can of worms they have let loose on the world; and despite the
fact that following that path could well turn out to be a dead end. None the
lees, it took someone like IBM to establish some sort of standard, in disk
formats, in screen addressing modes, in operating system behaviour, in software
portability, et al. And that can&rsquo;t be a bad thing from the user&rsquo;s point of view
however much you might disagree with the standards set.

And so to lost opportunities, many entrepreneurial types are importing
Taiwanese and Hong Kong made IBM clone cards. They are making money (perhaps
not as much as they would like, because there are too many of them) by
satisfying an increasing business market demand. Not to much for the main
computer cards but for bus cards. Mow many small UK manufacturers have always
been clever at designing cards for existing systems, yet I can only name one UK
designed and built card for the IBM, the I/O Research Pennant graphics card (a
sort of different shaped Super Pluto card), there my be more, but I don&rsquo; know
of them. Almost all the imported cards are cheap copies of already established
and obsolete American designs, and yet no new cards seem to be forthcoming.
Here&rsquo;s a hint to Gemini, the
<?php externalLink("GM870"); ?>
modem card is a beaut, it&rsquo;s well behaved, and
it&rsquo;s understandable. Come on John (Marshall&nbsp;&ndash; MD of Gemini), get a hacksaw to
it, change it&rsquo;s shape, code convert the Gemini modem software and sell it
cheap!!! It doesn&rsquo;t have to be Hayes compatible (nice if it were) but no-one
out there is selling a half decent plug-in modem card for the IBM and the market
must be enormous. Commit to making enough of them and you could happily tell it
cheap enough. Alright, so my suggesting to John to make IBM cards isn&rsquo; going
to help us 8-bit Gemini type directly, but in the long term it could.
</p>
<p>
For instance, Gemini promised an 8088 or 8086 or 80186 &lsquo;IBM compatible&rsquo;
adaptor card for the Gemini kit, that is, it&rsquo;s got to run MS-DOS properly. This
is no great secret and the idea has been rattling about for a couple of years
or more. Where is it? I&rsquo;m not talking about the Costgold card, I don&rsquo;t know
them, and I&rsquo;ve never seen a review which convinces me of its worth. Now if
Gemini had made that card a couple of years ago. I, and I am sure many others,
would have bought it then, if the price had been half reasonable. Instead I&rsquo;m
faced with the prospect of forking up a couple of grand for an IBM&nbsp;AT clone (the
only IBM offering which approaches the speed I&rsquo;ve taken as being normal for the
last three or four years) because the software I write for work has to be &lsquo;IBM
compatible&rsquo; these days. True I&rsquo;ve got IBM machines at work, but if I want to
write things over the weekend I have to lug one of these home with me and they
certainly don&rsquo;t qualify at portable machines. Well not unless you have
particular liking for wearing truss.
</p>
<p>
What I&rsquo;m saying is that I have been forced into a position where IBM is
beautiful (well not to much beautiful as tolerable) and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone
I&rsquo;would far rather convert my existing kit into a Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>DH/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>IBM hybrid
than to invest in new kit. Such a conversion might be difficult but by no means
impossible, and at least I would know what made it tick. (That&rsquo;s an indictment
of IBM&rsquo;s documentation, where quantity is everything but quality and information
is nonexistent.) Come on John, it&rsquo;s almost too late, I&rsquo;ve got to buy this
machine by February, and I&rsquo;d far rather give my hard earned loot to someone I&rsquo;m
charitable enough to think cares, than to some inscrutable chinese represented
in this country by a bunch of know-nothing box pedlars.
