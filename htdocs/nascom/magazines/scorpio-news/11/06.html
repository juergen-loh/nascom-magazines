&lsquo;As you can see from the earlier paragraphs, I was # &lsquo;bit miffed at the turn
of eventy last May, since then T ve bad the time to worry about such
things, I&rsquo;ve been too busy learning and revising my opinions. that doesn&rsquo;t mean
Live deserted my trusty Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>DH machine at home, but it does mean that
Tive spent a considerable amount of time investigating &lsquo;the performance (oF 18
mast instances, the lack of) of various IBM micros and their clones. Because
thee&rsquo;s what selie (in quantity) whilet Geminis don&rsquo;t Cin quantity).

<p>
The recent experience with other machines has also opened my eyes to the
</p>
<p>
good points and failings of the more popular compet ition, but even more #0 to
</p>
<p>
jtrich Like behaviour of many UK companies to adapt

and despite the

<p>

however much you might disagree with the standards set

And so to lost opportunities, many entrepreneurial types are importing
Taiwanese and Hong Kong made T8M clone cards. They are making aoney (perhaps
not as much ag they would like, because there are too many of thea) by
Satisfying an increasing business market demand. &ldquo;Not to much for the main
Compacer cards but for bus cards. Mow many.

Here&rsquo;s 4 hint to Gemini, the GM870 mode:

it&rsquo;s understandable Come on John (Mareball hacksaw to

Cheapiit tt doesn&rsquo;t have to be Hayes compatible (nice 4f st were) but no-one.
ove thece is selling a half decent plug-in modem card for the TBM and the market
&lsquo;must be enormous. Commit to making enough of them and you could happily tell. it
Cheap enough. Alright, so my suggesting to John to make IBM carde Lent going
to&rsquo;nelp us B-bit Gemini type directly, but in the Tong term it could

<p>
For inatance, Gemini promised an 8088 or 8086 or 80186 &lsquo;IBM compatible&rsquo;
adaptor card for the Gemini &lsquo;kit, that is, it&rsquo;s got to run MS-DOS properly. This
Ty Tno great secret and the idea has been rattling about fora couple of years
or more Where is 1t? i&rsquo;m not talking about the Cortgold card, I don&rsquo;t know
them, and I&rsquo;ve never seen s review which convinces me of tes worth. Now if
Gemini nad made that card a couple of years ago. I, and 1am sure many others,
would have bought it then, if the price had been half reasonable Instead I&rsquo;n
Eaced with the prospect of forking up s couple of grand for an IBM&nbsp;AT clone (the
only IBM offering which approsches the speed I&rdquo; 1 for the
Inst three or four years) because the software T ell to be &ldquo;IBM
compatible&rsquo; these days. True I&rsquo;ve got IBM machines at work, but if T want to
Write things over the veekend I have to lug one of these home with me and they
Certainly don&rsquo;t quality at portable machines Well not unless you have
particular Liking for wearing&rsquo;&laquo; truss.
</p>
<p>
What I&rsquo;m saying is that I have been forced into a position where IBM is
beauiful (well not to much beautiful ax toleraple) and T&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone
T&rsquo;would&rsquo; far rather convert my existing kit into &laquo; Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>DH/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>IBH hybrid
than to invest dn new kit. Such a conversion might be difficult but by no means
Impossible, and at Least I would know what made it tick. (That&rsquo;s an indicement,
of T8M&rsquo;s documentation, where quantity Je everything but quality and information
is nonexistent ) Come on John, it&rdquo; z&rsquo;too late, I&rsquo;ve got to buy thit
&lsquo;machine by February, and I&rsquo;d fac cath &lsquo;hard earned loot to someone I&rsquo;s
ritable enough to think cares,
in this country by # bunch of know-nothing box pedlarst
