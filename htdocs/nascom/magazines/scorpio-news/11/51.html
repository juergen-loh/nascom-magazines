Making CP/M More User Friendly by C. Bowden
ticle briefly discusses the software available to Leprove CP/M and
</p>
<p>
tht
some simple CBIOS modifications that the ry out, that will
ge &lsquo;additional system fleribility. These modifications apply to CP/M Version
</p>
<p>
Only a day of two ago an acquaintance who 12 still using NASDOS and POLYDOS
rang me and said &ldquo;You use CP/M don&rsquo;t you- Ihave heard that ite as friendly as
[expletive deleted] so I don&rsquo;t know whether to upgrade&rsquo;. My reply war to the
effect that since he was s Aasbus/S0-BUS user, he could progress to what is
probably one of the best Laplementations of CP/M avallable.
</p>
<p>
Certainly, to the average user of microcomputers, the mouse and window
approach as exemplified in the Mackintoeh ie very attractive and easy to use,
However I think thet moat readers of thie nevaletter are probably more awace of
the inner vorkings of the machine then the average user. and would find the
Felative inaccessibility of the modern machine extremely frustrating,

rook a Litcie $id fashioned when compured with the sleek plastic
jcound now. but it lives on whilst many others fall by the wayside.
The enormous range of available CP/M software (and our Investment in it), and
the flexibility of systems Like ours make Lf worthwhile to stay in the 8 Bit
world.

<p>
Of course standard CP/M is rather unfriendly. Tt evolved in a world whe
TTY terminals, Tape readers and Punches were still common, thie is still
Feflected in software Like &pound;D.cOM and MBASIC.COM, where the line editing
features are truly as unfriendly ae a hungry wolf. Fortunately, it is not
necessary to remain locked in the embraces of standard CP/M. There is a lot of
software around, &lsquo;much of it in the public domain, that can transform CP/M into &copy;
much more sophisticated system, and che various CBIOS&rsquo;s available on Nasbus/80-
BUS systems Gake system extremely friendly when compared to many other system:
Above all, it ts the &lsquo;OW SCREEN&rsquo; EDIT feature, starting back in the good old
NASCOM days, that Le so useful,
</p>
<p>
CP/M consiete of three modules, namely the CCP, the BDOS and the BIOS.
These modules are much more fully described in the CP/M manuals, various books
and some of the references in appendix 2
</p>
<p>
The COP (Console Command Processor) Ls the part of CP/M that sits showing
the A&gt; prompt and waits for your command Tt ie 2k bytes long
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System) is the interface between Che CCP or
currently running program and the BIOS, Te is 3.sk bytes long
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The BIOS or CBIOS (Customized Basic Input Output System) holds the software
that actually controls the system hardware. The CBIOS therefore varies from
wachine to machine. Tt can be any Length up to about sk Bytes long. Obviously
the Longer the CBIOS, the Detter che system (ought 8o be) in terms of hardware
Support and user friendliness.

It Le not intended to describe in any detail the implementation or
modification of advanced module, ly well described in any
fccompanying documentation, but merely to describe whae is
