Review of the MAP-80 Video/Floppy Controfler by P.D. Coker

Over the past few years I have been using an 80-308
curd provides the video and floppy ait

Satlefactorily after a simple setting up of the FDC with an oscilloscope. The
Wrc is supplied ae a kit or ready-bulit, either as a video controller or floppy
Aisk controller only, or with both facilities implemented; &raquo; keyboard interface

The VFC card can be used in 3 ways: as a combined video and floppy disk
controller, as s video controller only or as a floppy disk controller (for 5.25*
or smaller driver only)

&lsquo;the floppy disk controller will cope with any make of drive, apart from
Some criticism har been levelled at MAP Systems for this, buc few users will
find {t a limitation. Also included is 4k of RAM, 2X of which Le used for the
display and the rest by the operating software &lsquo;It uses a total of 16 ports
which are link-selectable, enabling the User to choose any group of adjneent
ports from CO to EP: the defaule port allocations are from &pound;0 to EF but
Rlternatives are tuggested

<p>
&lsquo;The board contains &laquo; standard 6845 CRT controller and # 2797 FDC; unlike the
Gemini Ivc/svc, there is no on-board Z80 and the 279: &lsquo;more sophisticated
Version of the i797 disk controller used on the Gemini GM829 FDC/SASI board, and
Is from the same family a the 2793 disk controller used on the more

Gemini cMaeo POC/SCSI controller. ALL this Le contained on a sin
board which plugs directly into the usual 80-BUS conne

<p>
ff&rsquo;the kit is constructed and
</p>
<p>
will do thie for you for a enall fee, but che construction
Gnd the average person would find iittle difficulty in producing &laquo; working
version.

There is a significant design difference between the two types of video
Controller: the Gemini IVC and SYC have a 200 incorporated on the board (290A in
the case of the {VC and a Z60B which uns at Gus in the SVC) Effectively,
these are single-board, highly specialized micro-computers, vhereas the VFC has
no microprocessor included and thus forgoes the benefite of paraliel-procestin
For many applications this will not be &laquo; great disadvantage since the VEC
foftwace ix quite sophiseicated and carries ut the task of interfaciag between
the VFC and CPU very efficiently so that most users would not be aware of any
difference in the perfor! veTthe sve,

Standard veraion ts used).
