run, even though similar programs written when the system was much smaller
worked well. Even more interestingly (I probably mean disgustingly), the system
refuses to work at all without the I/O board. I suspect that either the
the motherboard affecting the I/O control signals or the address bus. I meant
to replace the mother board with a decent one ages ago, as it is just Vero
board, but never got round to it due to the cost of the good ones. Any dealers
got a Microcode 14 slot board left? [Ed. &ndash; see the Newburn advert. They have
now taken over the production of this board.]
</p>
<p>
I have read and re-read all the various manuals, and am fairly sure all the
boards are set up correctly with regard to 80-BUS signals such as NASIO and
DBDR, which is an exercise I recommend for anyone who wants to test their
patience and comprehension. My decision, until such time as I decide to pull
the system to bits for maintenance, is to ignore all these problems, and program
round them. Hence the need for assembly language speed in the Prestel software,
in order that all the routines will be completed before incoming data has been
lost. And if the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
board keeps the system waiting, I suppose I will just
have to get the double speed processor option fitted, even if it is a silly
price.

HISOFT C, DOES IT HURT?
</h3>
<p>
No, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt your pocket, just your head. For very little money you get
a good manual, a good screen editor and a good compiler. But the language
itself rivals Forth for unreadability. (I know, you can write Forth so that
other people can read it, but who actually does?)
</p>
<p>
The manual contains a quite helpful tutorial section, and the editor is
excellent for programming use, as it has all the handy facilities like auto
indentation. It will not do justification though, or word-wrap, like your
favourite word processor. The really clever bit comes when the compiler finds a
mistake in your C program. It re-enters the editor at or near the error, for
you to fix it. Exit from the editor, and the compiler has another try. I like
this, it saves a lot of the time usually spent giving commands to the compiler
and editor on other systems! (I believe the newest version of the <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","Hisoft"); ?> Pascal
compiler also does this, and will let you know when I get mine updated.)
</p>
<p>
The version of C implemented has no floating point numbers at all, just
integers, which is a pity. It is a surprise too, given the good floating point
support in the Pascal compiler. I just hope they will be doing a version for
the Belectra board, as well as an ordinary Z80 version, when they do add floats.
The system as supplied, and the programs it compiles, certainly work, and I am
finding them helpful in my attempts to learn yet another language, but it is not
a pretty language!

<span class="uppercase">Prestel On Pluto</span>
</h3>
<p>
Mentioned above, I am writing a Prestel program to put a display on the
<?php externalLink("Pluto"); ?>
board, instead of using the useful &lsquo;Pretzel II&rsquo; I bought with the MODEM which
uses the
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
(or an
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>)
for its display. When finished, this will have quite a
few fancy facilities, which would normally make it well worth trying to market
the program. However, how many people have compatible hardware? If either of
them is interested in a copy, they can contact me to arrange a swap for some
Pluto program of their own writing. Anything pretty, like Mandelbrot set stuff,
or flight simulators, would be most acceptable&hellip;
