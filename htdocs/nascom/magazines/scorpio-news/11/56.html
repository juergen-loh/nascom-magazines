I have detected &laquo; problem with BDOSZ. Recently I have added a Winchester
isk to a Gemini system. Despite the fact that CP/M Plus is available, CP/H 2.2
fon the machine in question has been customized extensively slong the lines of
this article and thie operating aystem is still preferred for many purposes.
Consequently T needed compatibility between CP/M 2.2 and CP/M Plus in Winchester
support eventually cobbled together # CBIOS with all of the re:
fFetlures and compatiote Disk format by using&rsquo; couple of MAP CP/M 2.2 BIOS&rsquo;s end
some routines from SYS.
</p>
<p>
CP/M 22 at that stage had CPZ and BDOSZ in operation I then found that
</p>
<p>
th CP/M 2.2 and CP/M Plus were treating the floppy drives the same in respect
of the way the Directory Block allocation war being written, but wrote them
Gicferently to the Winchester. CP/M Plus was putting a 00 byte between. block
Bumbers on the Winnie directory, but CP/M 22 was not. After reverting to
standard CP/M 2.2 BOOS the Directory on the Winnie was the same on both versions
of CP/M The 00 byte is not present on the floppy directory under either
operating system but present on the Winnie under both. If anyone knows of &amp;
patch for BD0S2 to make it treat the Winnie properly, I would be pleased to
Obtain detail
