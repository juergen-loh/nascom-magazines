The listing above, on pages&nbsp;48 and 50, shows in upper case part of the
original BIOS code (MAP BIOS), and lower case shows the modifications, but note
that the cursor definitions have been moved into CURON/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>CUROFF to fit in with
other BIOS modifications.
</p>
<p>
If there is plenty of spare space in the BIOS, quite a number of printer
support features could be incorporated, and even function key redefinitions.

I have detected a problem with BDOSZ. Recently I have added a Winchester
disk to a Gemini system. Despite the fact that CP/M Plus is available, CP/M&nbsp;2.2
on the machine in question has been customized extensively along the lines of
this article and this operating system is still preferred for many purposes.
Consequently I needed compatibility between CP/M&nbsp;2.2 and CP/M Plus in Winchester
support eventually cobbled together a CBIOS with all of the required
features and compatible Disk format by using a couple of MAP CP/M&nbsp;2.2 BIOS&rsquo;s and
some routines from SYS.
</p>
<p>
CP/M&nbsp;2.2 at that stage had CCPZ and BDOSZ in operation. I then found that
with CP/M&nbsp;2.2 and CP/M Plus were treating the floppy drives the same in respect
of the way the Directory Block allocation war being written, but wrote them
differently to the Winchester. CP/M Plus was putting a 00 byte between block
numbers on the Winnie directory, but CP/M&nbsp;2.2 was not. After reverting to
standard CP/M&nbsp;2.2 BDOS the Directory on the Winnie was the same on both versions
of CP/M. The 00 byte is not present on the floppy directory under either
operating system but present on the Winnie under both. If anyone knows of a
patch for BDOSZ to make it treat the Winnie properly, I would be pleased to
obtain details.
