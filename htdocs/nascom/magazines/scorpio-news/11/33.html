MIRAGE PROSECT
</p>
<p>
Scorpio News readers may be interested in a current Mirage-driven project. This
is called PPPP. Tt Lo not s sign of incontinence but stands for Pascal Program
Porting Project and is aimed at those who have written marketable programs in
extended Pascale (SVS, Tucbo, HT+ or UCSD for example) and who would ike &amp;
larger market by porting to Mirage via its excellent $vifte-Pascal compilet
</p>
<p>
Straightforward code presents no porting problem tos multi-user environment and
</p>
<p>
aly the file-handiing rourines need to be re-writven to uae either Mirage&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>
Locke Manager or the TRAP ISAM file processor. Ported programs may either be
ed by their authors of by Sahara Software togecher with Harston Spurrier.
</p>
<p>
include the port of the Omnis 3 database manager
ind two CAD packages, Tt would be very interesting

Reweletter. Looking back a y funer
occasion, it is possible to state chat all the 80-305 adherents aust have
fchieved a great Leap forward in their knowledge and experience a1 the result of
Gur &lsquo;contact, and chat the nation ae a whole must have benefited, both
&lsquo;economically &lsquo;and educationally
</p>
<p>
Where these benefits to the individual and the syst
in having encouraged exposure to machine code and electronics, vith the result
that many enthusiasts Rave gone on to develop there interests on ocher
Computers, from &lsquo;micros&rsquo; right up to mainframes.

jcom originally stood in the almost unique position in offering &laquo; fairly
&lsquo;ented and eninently communicable board to the unskilled public: the pity
cits original high cost never came down with the reduction in chip
which encouraged other bourd producers co &lsquo;hike-up&rsquo; their prices, and

for a simple board vith 60 colunn display but otherwise software compatible
(with the Wascom?? &ndash; Ed), T would Like to say again (and obviously for the last
time): our [Nascom customers") investment in Nascom and Gemini products now
stands at somevhere around &pound;4,000,000 (original boerds, add-ons, disk drives,
Software and firnware); it is a tragedy that auch of this investment will go to
