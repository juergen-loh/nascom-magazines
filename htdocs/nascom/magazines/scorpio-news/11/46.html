Program design is important and these preliminary steps should not be carried
out at che keyboard &ndash; one should, initially, concentrate on producing &raquo; plan for
svmodular&rsquo; program in which each&rsquo;unit contains # manageable number of Liner (not
ore than, &lsquo;say 30 of 40) Te is a good idea to place, say, output routines into
Subroutines (such as GOSUBs) rather&rsquo; than in the main part of the program unless
they ace used once only These subroutines themselves &lsquo;ure other
Subfoutines, so the importance of a well-structured program becomes apparent

The dest vay to achieve this ia by &copy; &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; approsch in vhich the main part
Of the program is coded and then checked for errors, and che outlines of the

This is true of programs published in this journal &ndash; thoes of us forcun
enough to have disks end &amp; copy of disk MBASIC are inclined to forget that
Nascom ROM BASIC is Less well endowed vith goodies (it&rsquo;s one-third the size).
The problem becomes most acute when gcaphics are involved &ndash; or when data I/O 18
required from particular ports vnich may have different addresyes according to
