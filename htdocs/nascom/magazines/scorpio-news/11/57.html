&lsquo;A Sideways Look at Benchmarks _ by P.D. Coker
</p>
<p>
A few years ago, PCW published a
with &laquo; Lise of aleros&rsquo; on
</p>
<p>
18 An BASIC, together
&lsquo;were arranged in order
</p>
<p>
chines&rdquo; versione &lsquo;of BASIC. No Nascom or Gemini
&lsquo;one machine vas designed by Cemint
</p>
<p>
(Himi 801, which did quite well in the teste).
</p>
<p>
The benchmarks vere structured so that for testa 2 &ndash; 7, subtracting the timing
for the previous test from the current tert time would give the time due to the
Foutine under examination. The eighth benchmark differed from the rest, which
tested che timings for arithmetic functions, GOSUBs and array handling since it
dealt with transcendental functions such ae SIN, LOG and exponent

I tried this one on the following machines (CPU and system clock frequency in
brackets)
</p>
<p>
uel (6502, mate) 22.1 secs
Bac B (6502, 2Ms) 513 secs
Rescom 2 (280,&rdquo; Utz no FDC) $0.1 seca
gbBC + TORCH 286 2nd processor 30.8 sece
Stascom 3 (280, amie) 330 seca

E&para; Using Z80 BBC BASIC and CP/M
* Using MBASIC and cP/H 2.2,
4 Using MBASIC and CP/H 3.0 (CP/M Plus)
</p>

I then found that the timing for the standard BBC was 5.1 seconds according to
Pow! Evidently their Beeb was cupercharged! More likely, line 170 of the
program had been amended to &ldquo;IF K&lt;100 THEN 230&rsquo; since the average value of 166
Gver the 8 tests was based on a timing of 51 seconde for no. 8 Colleagues who
have run this test on ocher machines mentioned in the PCW list have also
commented upon inaccuracies in the reported speeds. The 260 version of BBC
BASIC as used on the TORCH second procesvor war extremely fart but disk access
With chis cystem is dreadfully slow 1 did not have access to the Acorn 6502 0&rsquo;
260 second processors &ndash; it would have been interesting to ree their timings
</p>
<p>
More recently, # series of Benchmerks in PASCAL was produced by the same
magazine: these were 15 in number and designed to take account of the greater
Fange of features found in this language, but the overall philosophy was the
Sane. namely. by subtracting the timing for the previous test from the current
fest&rsquo; time, some ides could be gained of the time for the routine under
investigation. I was abl COMPAS v1 08, HP and ProPi
</p>
<p>
using CP/M 22 and CP/M fe to the conclusion that for BM2&rsquo;
2 PASCAL version of the BMS BASIC version, HP4 wag quite &laquo; lot faster then
COMPAS, poseibly because it uses 7 rather than 11 significant figure accuracy.
&lsquo;The retulte were at follows:
