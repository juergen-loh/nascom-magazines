translation table (known as logical sectors). In other words, using the table,
when sector 0 is required we find that the data will be read from sector 0 but
when sector 1 is required, we actually read from sector 3. If you compare the
results of the skew table and the translation table you will see that they have
identical effect with one exception A disk that has been written using
Sector translation must be read using the same translation table, otherwise
rubbich will result as the sectors will be read in the wrong order. If, however
a skewed disk is read on a machine that would normally use a different skew
factor (ie: perhaps the skew was set up for a 2MHz processor and we are reading
on a 4MHz processor), the only penalty would be one of speed of access. It is
worth noting perhaps that Gemini skew the system track of the disk differently
from the date tracks. On the system track, the sectors are recorded in the order
shown below while the sectors on the data tracks are skewed by 0, 1, 2 or 3 as
chosen by the user. The example sector skew shown a little earlier had a skew
factor of 2.

Getting back to the physical disk format, let us now look at what is physically
written to the disk during formatting. Most disk controllers format the disk by
writing a complete track at a time. To do this, the host microcomputer will have
assembled a memory image of the track which it will then transfer to the FDC
(Floppy disk controller) chip. The data consists of gaps, index and address
marks, track, side and sector numbers, CRC bytes and of course the areas for
saving the data.
</p>
<p>
Let us break the track up into its component parts and examine them in detail
starting with the track, side and sector information and the area for the data.
</p>
<p>
Each disk sector is preceded by an identification block containing information
about that sector. This block is six bytes in length and is identified to the
FDC chip by an ID address mark immediately before the block. The data in the
block is as follows:
</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td>1 byte</td><td> &nbsp; &ndash; &nbsp; Track Number</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 byte</td><td> &nbsp; &ndash; &nbsp; Side Number</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 byte</td><td> &nbsp; &ndash; &nbsp; Sector Number</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 byte</td><td> &nbsp; &ndash; &nbsp; Sector Length</td></tr>
<tr><td>2 bytes</td><td> &nbsp; &ndash; &nbsp; CRC byte</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The track and sector numbers on the disk may lie in the range 0 to 255 although
this will obviously be limited to the number of tracks that the disk drive is
capable of accessing and the number of sectors that will fit on one track of the
disk. The side number takes the value 0 or 1 The sector length byte (with the
FD1797) may fall in the range 0 to 3 and the values correspond to sector sizes
of 128, 256, 512 or 1024 bytes respectively. The two CRC bytes are automatically
computed by the FDC chip and will be written to the disk when instructed to do
so by the host computer.
</p>
<p>
When the FDC is instructed to read a sector, it first waits for an ID address
mark and then reads the ID block. If the side, track and sector information
matches the values given by the host computer, and if no CRC error has occurred,
the FDC will transfer data from the data area following the ID block. The data
area will be of the length indicated by the sector length byte and is preceded
by a Data Address mark on the disk. Initially, the data contains the value
0E5H for every byte. This value is set during formatting but in fact any value
could have been used. 0E5H is used, by convention, because IBM used this value
in their original floppy disk formats (back in the dim and distant past when 8&Prime;
floppies were used with mainframe computers and micros had not yet been
invented). Finally, the data area is terminated with 2 CRC bytes for error
checking.
</p>
<p>
Writing a sector is similar to reading but after the correct ID block has been
found, a data address mark is written to the disk followed by the number of data
