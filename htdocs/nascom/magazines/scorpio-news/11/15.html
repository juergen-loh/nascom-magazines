<p>
The form of the <span class="uppercase">Function</span> statement is as follows:
</p>
<p class="indent">
<span class="uppercase">Function</span> name (dummy arguments &ndash; if needed)
</p>
<p>
or, more explicitly,
</p>
<p class="indent">
type <span class="uppercase">Function</span> name (dummy arguments)
</p>
<p>
The reason for the second form is that the type can be explicitly declared a
<span class="uppercase">Integer</span>, REAL, <span class="uppercase">Double Precision</span>, <span class="uppercase">Logical</span> or (in ProFortran) <span class="uppercase">Complex</span>. Thus, if
the function required was called LENGTH and it was a REAL number rather than an
<span class="uppercase">Integer</span>, the correct form for the <span class="uppercase">Function</span> subprogram which gave the single
value for LENGTH would be:
</p>
<pre class="indent uppercase">
Real Function Length
</pre>
<p>
The same rule applies if the function name is one which by default would be a
REAL if an <span class="uppercase">Integer</span> value was required for example:
</p>
<pre class="indent uppercase">
Integer Function Area
</pre>
<h3 class="uppercase">
Intrinsic Functions
</h3>
<p>
In all high-level languages, there is a range of particular functions for which
the necessary code is supplied &ndash; such as INT or ABS in BASIC. These are termed
intrinsic functions and are called by name to produce a particular value. There
are rather more intrinsic functions in <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> than will be found in most BASICS
since some are available in integer, real and double precision forms. There is
always a list of these in the documentation associated with the version of
<span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> you are using. Some old favourites Like CHR$ and LEFT$ are never found
in <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>, others are spelt differently &ndash; SIGN rather than SGN &ndash; but most are
readily interpreted.
</p>
<h3 class="uppercase">
External Functions
</h3>
<p>
Again, these have their counterparts in BASIC although many are available in
double precision or even complex number forms in addition to the conventional
real number form &ndash; typical of these are the trigonometric functions, SIN, COS or
TAN, and SQRT &ndash; spelt differently to the BASIC way (SQR). There is log base e
(ALOG) and log base 10 (ALOG10) and a random number generator &ndash; variously spelt
RND or RAND. A list of these will also be found in the documentation, together
with a list of restrictions on the type of variable with which they can be used
&ndash; thus if you want the square root of a variable it must be of type real or
double precision and if it is an integer, this must be converted to real by the
use of a cunning little intrinsic function called FLOAT. Failure to do this
first will lead to an execution error and the program grinding to an
unprofitable halt. An external function called IFIX does just that to REAL
numbers, converting them to <span class="uppercase">Integer</span> type.

<h3>
DATA INPUT/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>OUTPUT
</h3>
<p>
On first acquaintance, this appears to be rather more complicated than in BASIC,
but it is a great deal more flexible. Data to be read into or results output
from s program can be in almost any desired form provided the machine is
properly instructed by meant of a FORMAT statement. Data is read in from either
keyboard or disk file using a READ statement and written to the screen, disk
file or printer by means of WRITE statement in their basic form these are as
follows:
</p>
<p class="center">
READ (u,f) k &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WRITE (u,f) k
</p>
