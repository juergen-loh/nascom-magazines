This is normally used as the terminator of a DO loop. Although it 18 classified
aa an executable statement it really doce nothing. ft is very useful 1f the
hormal terminator of # DO loop 1a one of the forbidden statements (GOTO, STOP
ete Jeince it allows the successful completion of the loop before control is
logically ceansferced co the next line of the program. Inthe above example,
Statement label 14 could be altered to:

the value of PROD is printed if it is
fed to another part of the prograe.

This article vas not intended to teach prospective users how to use FORTRAN, but
</p>
<p>
to give intending users some idea of the way in vhich it can be used A couple
of books ace worth mentioning which will give a more comprehensive coverage of
the Language. Wainweaght and Grant&rsquo;s contribution is quite handy since ft
treats BASIC and FORTRAN in parallel (there is a similar book for BASIC and
PASCAL) but the book is poorly produced by Sabani and includes a simple FORTRAN
Hntecpreter! weiteen in Spectrum BASIC &ndash; a nasty bit of work with many errors
Alcock&rsquo;s book is in the same mould as hiv original book on BASIC and is well
worth getting iF you like his style &ldquo;I recommend it to all my students since it
Ts&rsquo;intinicely more readable chan the majority of so-called text books oh
FORTRAN.
