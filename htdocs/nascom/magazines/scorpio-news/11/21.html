<h4>
CONTINUE statement
</h4>
<p>
This is normally used as the terminator of a DO loop. Although it is classified
as an executable statement it really does nothing. It is very useful if the
normal terminator of a DO loop is one of the forbidden statements (GOTO, STOP
etc.)<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>since it allows the successful completion of the loop before control is
logically transferred to the next line of the program. In the above example,
statement label 14 could be altered to:
</p>
<pre class="indent">
    PROD=PROD + A(I)
14  CONTINUE
    IF(PROD) 24,56,71
71  WRITE(5,100) PROD
          .
          .
    etc.
</pre>
<p>
In this case control is passed to 71 and the value of PROD is printed if it is
greater than 0.0; otherwise control is passed to another part of the program.
</p>
<h4>
END statement
</h4>
<p>
This is always the last statement in a FORTEAN program and its execution causes
control to be passed to the system exit routine and thence to CP/M; it has the
form:
</p>
<p class="indent2">
END
</p>
<p>
and may have, optionally, a statement number.

<h3>
CONCLUSIONS
</h3>
<p>
This article was not intended to teach prospective users how to use FOR&shy;TRAN, but
to give intending users some idea of the way in which it can be used. A couple
of books are worth mentioning which will give a more comprehensive coverage of
the language. Wainwright and Grant&rsquo;s contribution is quite handy since it
treats BASIC and FOR&shy;TRAN in parallel (there is a similar book for BASIC and
PASCAL) but the book is poorly produced by Babani and includes a simple FOR&shy;TRAN
&lsquo;interpreter&rsquo; written in Spectrum BASIC &ndash; a nasty bit of work with many errors.
Alrock&rsquo;s book is in the same mould as his original book on BASIC and is well
worth getting if you like his style. I recommend it to all my students since it
is infinitely more readable chan the majority of so-called text books on
FOR&shy;TRAN.
