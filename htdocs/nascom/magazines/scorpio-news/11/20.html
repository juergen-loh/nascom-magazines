<h4>
PAUSE statement
</h4>
<p>
This command also stops the execution of the program. It either takes the form:
</p>
<p class="center">
PAUSE &nbsp; &nbsp; or &nbsp; &nbsp; PAUSE (string of 1&nbsp;&ndash; 6 characters)
</p>
<p>
The characters, if present are displayed as before and program execution can be
resumed if needed by typing any character other than &lsquo;T&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; which terminates the
program at that point. This statement should be used with care since not all
<span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> compilers support it in precisely this fashion.
</p>
<h4>
CALL statement
</h4>
<p>
This statement transfers control into subroutines and provides parameters for
use by the subroutine. It has the general form:
</p>
<p class="center">
CALL subroutine name (dummy arguments)
</p>
<p>
Dummy arguments are values of expression which need to be transferred from the
CALLing program to the subroutine so that it can work properly. A more detailed
explanation it given in Alcock (pp 68-69) or in the Microsoft F-80, NFortran or
ProFortran documentation.
</p>
<h4>
RETURN statements
</h4>
<p>
These are always used when control is to be passed back from the subroutine to
the CALLing program.
</p>
<h4>
DO statements
</h4>
<p>
These provide a means for executing series of statements repetitively, just
in the FOR&nbsp;&ndash; NEXT loop in BASIC. The DO statement takes the following form:
</p>
<table class="fortran-control">
<tr><td>DO J K=M1,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>M2,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>M3</td><td>&ndash; or, where M3 is 1, it may be omitted<br>
			[J is a statement label, K is an integer or variable
			and M1, M2 end M3 are integer constants or integer
			or variables]</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A typical example might be:
</p>
<pre>
    DO 14 I=1,5
    .
    . (a series of executable statements)
    .
 14 PROD=PROD + A(I)
    WRITE(5,100) PROD
200 FORMAT(F6.3)
</pre>
<p>
in which the program executes the DO loop five times (as I goes from 1 to 5)
before writing out the result. The statement label J must actually occur and it
must not be a STOP, PAUSE, RETURN, arithmetic IF, GOTO or another DO. The
controlling index K must be an integer and always positive: M3 is the increment
thus if the first line of the DO loop was replaced by:
</p>
<pre class="center">
DO 14 I=1,9,2
</pre>
<p>
successive loops would increment the value of I by 2 (1,3,5,7,9) rather than
singly: this is analogous to the STEP statement in BASIC and some versions of
<span class="uppercase">Pascal</span>. DO loops can be nested so that one or more may exist within the range
of a larger loop but these nested loops must terminate inside the main loop.
Other features of DO loops are noted in the Microsoft or Prospero reference
manuals.
