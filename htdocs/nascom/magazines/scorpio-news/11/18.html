<p>
Field descriptors can be mixed in a format statement if a particular mode of I/O
is required. Thus if a record such as a batch identifier and number, followed
by various parameters is to be read or written, the associated format statement
could look like this:
</p>
<p class="center">
FORMAT(A4,2X,I3,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>2X,3F6.3)
</p>
<p>
This looks complicated but means that a letter batch identifier and 3 digit
batch number are followed by details of 3 parameters expressed as floating point
numbers, the batch i/d and serial numbers are separates by 2 spaces as are the
serial number and parameters. The output would appear as?:
</p>
<p class="center">
&macr;LOT&macr;&macr;123&macr;&macr;23.34517.27011.555
</p>
<p>
This looks a bit messy and the parameters should be spaced out; this can be done
simply by amending part of the format description to include spaces:
</p>
<p>
either &ndash; (A4,2X,I3,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>2X,F6.3,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>2X,F6.3,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>2X,F6.3)
</p>
<p class="indent">
which works but is untidy
</p>
<p>
or &ndash; (A4,2X,I3,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>3(2X,F6.3))
</p>
<p class="indent">
which also works but is better programming practice!
</p>
<p>
The effect of the change is as follows:
</p>
<p class="center">
&macr;LOT&macr;&macr;123&macr;&macr;23.345&macr;&macr;17.270&macr;&macr;11.555
</p>
<p>
The overall effect is to carry out the reading or printing of 3 sets of similar
combined fields and it should be noted that combinations of field descriptors
used in this way should be enclosed in round brackets.

Control Statements
</h3>
<p>
These guide the flow of the program and are of ten types (some of which are
identical to their BASIC equivalence)
</p>
<table class="control-statements">
<tr><td>1. GO TO</td><td>2. IF</td><td>3. STOP</td><td>4. ASSIGN</td><td>5. DO</td></tr>
<tr><td>6. CONTINUE</td><td>7. CALL</td><td>8. PAUSE</td><td>9. RETURN</td><td>10. END</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>
GO TO statements
</h4>
<p>
These may be unconditional (e.g. GOTO 100 which transfers control ta another
part of the program just as in BASIC), computed (e.g. GOTO (80,90,100,123) K,
Where K is an integer variable such that if K has a value of 3, then control is
passed to the statement label which is third in the list &ndash; in this case, 100).
Note that if the value of K is 0 or greater than the number of statement numbers
in the list (4 in this case), then control passes to the next logical statement
in the program sequence
</p>
<p>
Assigned GO TO statements are not often used and the ASSIGN statement label(s)
must be declared before they are used in this way &ndash; thus:
</p>
<table class="fortran-control">
<tr><td>ASSIGN 100 TO MILK</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>ensures that in an assigned GOTO of the form</td></tr>
<tr><td>GOTO MILK</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>control is only passed to statement number 100</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
More than one ASSIGN statement can be used so that if:
</p>
<table class="fortran-control">
<tr><td>ASSIGN 212 TO MILK</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>the next assigned GOTO which mentions the variable
MILK will Look like:</td></tr>
<tr><td>GOTO MILK,(100,212)</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>and control will be passed to whichever statement
number corresponds with the current value of the
variable MILK.</td></tr>
</table>
