Field descriptors can be mixed in a format statement Lf a particular mode of I/O
is required. Thus {fa record such ae a batch identifier and number, followed
by various parameters iy to be read or weitten, the associated Format&rsquo; statement
could Look Tike thie:
</p>
<p>
FORMAT(AG,2X,13,2%,3F6 3)
</p>
<p>
This looks complicated but means that &laquo;4 Letter batch identifier and 3 digit
batch number are followed by detaile of 3 parameters expressed ag floating point
numbers, the batch i/d and serial numbers are separates by 2 spaces ae ace the
Serial umber and parameters The output would appear as?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;vor 32323.34517.27011.535
</p>
<p>
This looks a bit messy and the parameters should be spaced out; this can be done
simply by amending pare of the format description to include spaces:
</p>
<p>
edther &ndash; (4.2K, 3,2K,76.3,2%,P6.3,2%,76.3)
which works but ie untidy
or = (AM, 2K, 13,3(28,76.39)
</p>
<p>
which also works but is better programming practic!
</p>
<p>
The effect of the change ts as follows:
&ldquo;yor 12323. 34549. 270-21. 555
</p>
<p>
The overall effect 4s to carry out the reading or printing of 3 sets of similar
</p>
<p>
Combined fields and it should &lsquo;be noted that combinations of Field descriptors
</p>
<p>
sed in thir way should be enclosed in round brackets.
</p>
<p>
CONTROL, STATEMENTS
</p>
<p>
1d are of ten types (some of which are
</p>
<p>
ide the flow of the progra
i to heir BASIC equivalence)
</p>
<p>
Th
i

<p>
1.6070 2 IF 3, STOR, A. ASSIGN 5. DO
S. CONTINUE 7.CaLL 8 PAUSE 9. RETURN 10&rdquo; END
</p>
<p>
0 70 statements
</p>
<p>
These may be unconditional (e c GOTO 100 which transfers control ta another
part of the program just as in BASIC), computed (e.g. GOTO (80,90,100,123) K,
Where K is an integer variable auch that {Khas a value of 3, chen control is
passed tothe statement label which is third in the list &ndash; inthis case, 100].
Note that if the value of K is 0 or greater than the nunber of statemene numbers
inthe List (4 in this case), then control passes to the next logical statement
in the progeam sequence
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;Assigned O70 statements are not often weed and the ASSION
</p>
<p>
statemene Label(s)
</p>
<p>
Be declared before they are used in thie way &ndash; thusy
ASSIGN 100 TO MILK &ndash; ensures that {n an assigned GOTO of the form
Goro milk J control is only passed to statement number 100
</p>
<p>
More than one ASSIGN statement can be used #0 that ifs
</p>
<p>
ASSION 212 TO MILK &ndash; che next assigned GOTO which mentions the variable
MILK will Look like:
</p>
<p>
Goto MILK, (100,222) &ndash; and control vill be passed to whichever statement
humber corresponds with the current value of the
variable MILK
