So the final answer is to &lsquo;do it oneself&rsquo;, where the cost of the tine taken

in end it not considered jaterial part of the costs. If T
considered the cost of the time which T have spent in designing one off projects
for ay own use 1 would never have started them in the first place. Certainly if
Someone offered me one of ay one off projects at a realistic price I would have

I don&rsquo;t consider myself ae an unusually mercenary individual but T do like
some (token) reward for my efforts, and in that I don&rsquo;t consider myself unusual.
Many things ace undertaken for the pleasure in doing them (I don&rsquo;t write for
this sag for the money, I&rsquo;ll never get rich that way) and the rewards need not
be monetary. But I personally think that your HOCSAN appeare to represent
very considerable amount of hard work and Lf it 42 to contain ULAR, then a180
prohibitively expensive, certainly not something to be undertaken for fun. If
fe&rsquo;tsn&rsquo;e fun, chen someone (or many) will expect to get paid, and the projected
price will go out of the window No sorry Sir, itvs a nice idea, but to me,

&lsquo;A Review of the 2MB Upgrade for the GM833_by D. Greenfield
</p>
<p>
The Gemini GM833 Virtual disk board has proved very useful for over two years
When this board was first used, it seemed that it vould never become full.
Could it be that software iz more sophisticated, or is it just less efficient 7
Anyhow, &ldquo;Disk Full&rdquo; or &ldquo;Write Error Drive MY started to rear ite ugly h
</p>
<p>
It seems that a virtual disk drive must have at least the capacity of &laquo; floppy
diac on the system. Preferably ie should have a lot more, at lesst S01 more at
a lot of temporary files ace produced during working.
</p>
<p>
fitted to the CH833 in about an
a"timen ite original capacity. the
Kit comes as a small ped. wire, y TGs, instructions and double sided
Sticky tape Co hold the small Pcb to the ain board. Everything went well on
the modification, the instructions were reasonable, although an actual photo of
the board would make component Location easier. No cracks are cut thank
Goodness. &ldquo;8 wires are used to connect the pcb co the main board at various
Pointe. Pin 1 of all the memory ICe ware connected together This provides the
extra address Line required.

<p>
Everything seemed fine, on startup, the M&gt; prompt displayed as usual Running
*STAT&rdquo; displayed &lsquo;202K Bytes Free&rsquo;. However, on loading more than 512K, the
system failed. It seemed chat the same SIZE vas &ldquo;reflected&rdquo; 4 times on the

solder pins had bri 1a a. fing this fault

To conclude, the board represents good value. With care of soldering, the mod
