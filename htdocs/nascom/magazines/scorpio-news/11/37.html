start. And who is going to pay for component procurement, and a &lsquo;get you going&rsquo;
service after it&rsquo;s built? No there&rsquo;s nothing in it for a potential manufacturer
&ndash; believe me, if there were, they&rsquo;d have done it long ago.

<p class="text-indent">
So the final answer is to &lsquo;do it oneself&rsquo;, where the cost of the time taken
to achieve an end it not considered as a material part of the costs. If I
considered the cost of the time which I have spent in designing one off projects
for my own use I would never have started them in the first place. Certainly if
someone offered me one of my one off projects at a realistic price I would have
certainly done without and not bought it.
</p>
<p class="text-indent">
I don&rsquo;t consider myself as an unusually mercenary individual but I do like
some (token) reward for my efforts, and in that I don&rsquo;t consider myself unusual.
Many things ace undertaken for the pleasure in doing them (I don&rsquo;t write for
this mag for the money, I&rsquo;ll never get rich that way) and the rewards need not
be monetary. But I personally think that your MOCSAN appears to represent
very considerable amount of hard work and if it is to contain ULAs, then also
prohibitively expensive, certainly not something to be undertaken for fun. If
it isn&rsquo;t fun, then someone (or many) will expect to get paid, and the projected
price will go out of the window. No sorry Sir, it&rsquo;s a nice idea, but to me,
it&rsquo;s not on. Perhaps I&rsquo;am a minority, I&rsquo;d welcome other views.

A Review of the 2MB Upgrade for the GM833

The Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM833"); ?>
Virtual disk board has proved very useful for over two years.
When this board was first used, it seemed that it would never become full.
Could it be that software is more sophisticated, or is it just less efficient&nbsp;?
Anyhow, &ldquo;Disk Full&rdquo; or &ldquo;Write Error Drive M&rdquo; started to rear its ugly head.
</p>
<p>
It seems that a virtual disk drive must have at least the capacity of a floppy
disc on the system. Preferably it should have a lot more, at least 50% more as
a lot of temporary files are produced during working.
</p>
<p>
The PBM upgrade for the Gemini GM833 board was fitted to the CM833 in about an
hour. This upgrades the GM833 to 2MBytes, 4 times its original capacity. The
Kit comes as a small pcd, wire, 41256 memory ICs, instructions and double sided
sticky tape to hold the small Pcb to the main board. Everything went well on
the modification, the instructions were reasonable, although an actual photo of
the board would make component location easier. No tracks are cut, thank
goodness. 8 wires are used to connect the pcb to the main board at various
points. Pin 1 of all the memory ICs were connected together. This provides the
extra address line required.
</p>
<p>
Everything seemed fine, on startup, the M&gt; prompt displayed as usual. Running
&ldquo;STAT&rdquo; displayed &ldquo;2024K Bytes Free&rdquo;. However, on loading more than 512K, the
system failed. It seemed that the same 512K was &ldquo;reflected&rdquo; 4 times on the
board. A phone call to PBH syetems threw light on the problem, two of the
solder pins had bridged with solder under the board. Removing this fault
resulted in correct opteration. The board has been running correctly since.
</p>
<p>
To conclude, the board represents good value. With care of soldering, the mod
is easy to implement.
