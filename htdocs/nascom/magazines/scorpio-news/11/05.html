Farewell 80-BU5 Hews &ndash; ello Scorpio Hews
way 1986
</p>
<p>
Gorit&rsquo;s the end of an era _80-RUS News is coming to an end. That&rsquo;s about
</p>
<p>
far
</p>
<p>
seven years of continuous (Lf exratic) publication under different guises;
better record than some computer mags that I could name,
</p>
<p>
As has beon remarked to me by more than one 80-BUS News subscriber, &lsquo;Is
this the end of Geminis support for the home urer?*. Well I feac that it might
Appear a0, although the facts could be different. But then again, 1 don&rsquo;t knov!
My hesitation could be that I&rsquo;m feeling distinctly uninformed and more than #
bic aifted by the way the decision to pull the plug was taken. certainly f
wasn&rsquo;t consulted, and che firet I heard of it vas by earvigging tos
Conversation over iunch ata recent Gemini dealer aeeting. Sketchy detaits were
then announced to the deelers at that meeting in the afternoon. It wasn&rsquo;t until
Tstarted receiving phone calls from subscribers that I learned about the Lecter
(which of &lsquo;course tovone had thought to send me), announcing the demise, after
the publication of volume
</p>
<p>
So what course now, well certainly I shall subscrabe to the CP/M Users&rdquo;
Group, and if asked, aay be pen the odd word or two {knowing me, the odd word or
6000), for them As co keeping informed on Gemini products, updetes, bugs and
Other interesting snippets, I&rsquo;ve no doubt that as a dealer I&rsquo;shall find out
What&rsquo;s going on anyuay&rdquo; Buc I suspect that for the general reader, thelr
propoved Gemini Newsletter will not have the same irressstible tendency to
Fenain stuck in ones hand until every word has been read (twice) and then
lovingly kept for future reference A brief scan end then chucked in the bin
will, guess, be more like it
</p>
<p>
As for support of the existing user base for Gemini and Nascom products.
</p>
<p>
Gemint insist thar the existing 80-BUS product range will continue well into the
1090": with a vigorous process of development of new hardware, some being new
products, some being redesigns of earlier products to take advant:
Eechnology. However, the trend hes been progressively up market of lace,
although the pockets of the more serious &lsquo;computerphile&rsquo; are pretty Lengthy, and
provided the product is the right product then price is of little consequence,
there must come # time when the bottom of the most Lengthy pockets has been
Eeached for one consider the current Gemini developments to be in the wrong
Gicection, profitable for Gemini possibly, interesting for me &ndash; t doubt tv

<p>
This File was found unfinished on my S0-BUS disk, and today, the 12eh
December T&rsquo;ve decided to finish it
</p>
<p>
December 1986
</p>
<p>
Six months on and how things have changed I have been in a new and
digferene jou for five months, still Loosely attached vo Gemini by merit of @
small Gemini dealership in the Amersham area, although that ist ey aain
concern. Hy new job has widened my perspective of the &lsquo;serious&rsquo; computer&rsquo; vorld
and what is more they pay me more money!
</p>
<p>
Then a few days ago a green leaflet dropped through the letter box together
with a request for any unpublished @0-BUS material I might have So I&rsquo;ve blown
the dust off the inconplace 80-BUS material I&rsquo;ve got lying around and have come
lip with this amongst other things Ar Scorpio sounded mich Like that other well
Known sign of the Zodiac, I decided to Investigate. 8 bit of digging soon
Fevealed its independence and that they have gone out and bought a blue pencil
of their very oun Just to test thelr independence I&rsquo;ll write something really
Contentious for the next issue and see if they print it &ndash; Warch this space f
hasten co add thar I have nothing to do with Scorpio except in the respect th
hope to becomes contributor Perhaps after my forthcoming effort they von&rsquo;t
print anyching from me ever again.
