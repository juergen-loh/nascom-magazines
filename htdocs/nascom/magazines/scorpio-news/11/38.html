Doctor Dark&rsquo;s Diary &ndash; Episode 24
</p>
<p>
Just as T was about to start my ovn Nascom fanzine, duplicated badly, and
printed on grotty paper, the Leaflet advertising Scorpio News arrived. i wa
Gelighted to see it, and&rsquo; posted ay subscription the eame afternoon. After ally
T&rsquo;suspect publishing is jolly hard work, printed on decent
quality paper as well. Besides, 1 would have needed the address list of the 80-
Bus subscribers, and someching to print...

&lsquo;THE STORY SO FAR

<p>
For che benefit of the many who have never heard of me, and have not read the
Hous 23 episodes of this column, now sppearing in ite third magazine, T
ele amateur computer owner.&rdquo; I&rsquo;am enthusiastic because the sachin
We all have in common are so good, compared vith the other stuff on the market.
&lsquo;And Tam an amateur because there don&rsquo;t see to be any computer firme with the
Sense to offer me a job in this neck of the voods

feat, av this document wae designed to prevent people from wanting to use their
Nascom is. By the time 1 had finished ay machine code blorhytha progra

Languages {n use are Z80 assembler whenever I vant thing
fase, Basic when they can go slowly, and nobody is going te know, Fascal. when t
am writing something large, with fancy data structures, and C when I am in the
food for tome suffering and can stand the ugliness of it. For instance, my
Current&rsquo; project, some Prestel software, is being written in assembler, in&rsquo; the
hope that it will go fast enough not to need fancy queues of data of horrid
Anterrupt driven software. I was originally going to write it in Hieoft Pascal,
but changed my mind because I thought it might not go quite fast enough, and
Because f would have ad to plan everything properly. T decided against &amp; for
the simple reason that 1 don&rsquo;t feel 1 know it fuily yet (Hae anyone seen &amp;

&lsquo;As is well known, the Gemini GHB70 MODEM board and the Belectra HSA
point board both use port addresses &pound;60 and &pound;81, s0T can aot use them both at
Once In theory, it is possible to move &laquo; Link on the HSA-as
other ports, but (agein) mine von&rsquo;t- I am planning to build some sort of
Secoder to select between the two boards, if there is no other cure, but not
Unless I have to.

The main reason 1 described interrupt routines as unplessant above ig that the
Inst one T wrote, several tines, refuses to work. It tried to use the CTC chip
&lsquo;on&rsquo;my Nascom&nbsp;1/6 board &lsquo;to interrupt the ayeten regularly, in order to read the
