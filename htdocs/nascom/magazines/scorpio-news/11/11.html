<p>
DOUBLE PRECISION types are real data with an accuracy of greater than 16
significant digits with the same range as real data.
</p>
<p>
LOGICAL types are single byte representations of .TRUE. or .FALSE., with
.FALSE. equivalent to zero and .TRUE. has a value of &ndash;1; in practice, any non-zero
value will be treated as TRUE. in a logical IF statement.
</p>
<p>
HOLLERITH types (named in honour of the inventor of the punched card tabulator)
consist of a string of any number of characters from the computer&rsquo;s character
set. They are sometimes known as &lsquoTEXT&rsquo; or &lsquo;LITERAL&rsquo; types.
</p>
<p>
F80 does not support COMPLEX data types, but ProFortran does. A COMPLEX
variable has two components &ndash; a real part and an imaginary part &ndash; each of type
REAL.
</p>
<p>
FOR&shy;TRAN constants are of types INTEGER, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, LOGICAL,
HOLLERITH and, additionally in F80, HEXADECIMAL.
</p>
<p>
The INTEGER type has from 1 &ndash; 5 decimal digits together with a &lsquo;-&rsquo; sign if
appropriate. e.g 521, 2, &ndash;45, 00012
</p>
<p>
REAL types have 7 digit precision and are represented either in floating point
(F) or exponent (E) format. For example, 3.21456 is a floating point REAL
constant and 0.321456E&nbsp;1 is the exponent equivalent &ndash; as in BASIC the use of the
&lsquo;E&rsquo; indicates &lsquo;10 to the power&rsquo; and the figure that follows is the index of the
power &ndash; in this case, 1. REAL numbers can be positive or negative and must have
a decimal point. They will be truncated if the number of figures exceeds the
stated level of precision.
</p>
<p>
DOUBLE PRECISION type constants have a higher Level of precision and obey the
rules for REAL numbers &ndash; but with more significant figures or the use of &lsquo;D&rsquo; in
the exponent format &ndash; thus 4.172345860098 is a double precision number as is &ndash;.786D&nbsp;4
</p>
<p>
LOGICAL constants are either .TRUE. or .FALSE. and generate FF (hex) and 0 (hex).
</p>
<p>
LITERAL constants are strings of any character except the single quote ('),
enclosed by single quotes. 'QWERTYUIOP' is one such constant.
</p>
<p>
HEXADECIMAL constants are found in F80 but rarely in other FOR&shy;TRAN versions. The
constant consists of up to 4 hexadecimal digits enclosed in single quotes and
preceded by a Z or X Z. Z'FA12' and X'2C' are examples.
</p>
<p>
FOR&shy;TRAN variables are identified by symbolic names which are strings of 1 to 6
alphanumeric characters which are unique to the program in which they are used.
The first character must be a letter (apart from the doller sign &ndash; which is
reserved for system variables and runtime subprogram names. The restriction of
variable names to a maximum of 8 characters is a consequence of the IBM origin
of the Language.
</p>
<p>
Variables are (by default) of types denoted by the initial letter and the
convention is that integer variables have names beginning with any letter from I
to N and real variables begin with A &ndash; H and O &ndash; Z. To complicate matters
slightly, a variable may explicitly be assigned to a different type by
declaration at the beginning of a program or subroutine. Thus START is a real
variable and ISTART is an integer variable by default, but by means of an
explicit declaration statement:
</p>
<p class="center">
INTEGER START &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; REAL INPUT
</p>
<p>
as described, the program will treat variable START as an integer and INPUT as a
real. Double precision and logical are declared in the same way.
