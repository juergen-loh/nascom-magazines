Multilet Design Philosophy
</p>
<p>
The aim of Gemini&rsquo;s Multinet networking system is to provide computing
Facilities toa number of people for the minioum possible cost Ara very
significant proportion of the cost of any system is in the mass storage and hard
Copy devices, the overall cost of a multiple system installation can be
dramatically reduced by allowing # number of users to share these fa

<p>
Share&rsquo; in this instance means the ability for any user to be able to
of the mass storage device, but mot, in general, the sharing of the stored data

(P/M Compatibility
</p>
<p>
As Gemini Multioard systems ace all capable of cunning the CP/M operatin
System, and given the amount of applications software available for that
operating system, MultiNec ds designed to provide a CP/M. -compatibie
Shvironment, the major difference being that the user need nov have Physical
ink deives present at his Workstations but the Hultinet software refere all
ise requests to a Fileserver
</p>
<p>
To achieve this, software has to be written that Looks to the applications
program as though it te CP/M, but in reality this software contains no disk
driver or file Mandiing routines, but instead re! foto the Fileserver
that is controlling the mae etorage.
</p>
<p>
documentation is used to write software that meets the given specif
closely as possible, given the major premise that there are no. physi
present &ldquo;Unfortunately, in practice, it is found that certain progeai
Sr certain quirke&rsquo; of &ldquo;undocumented features of CP/M, and so the emulatior
Software hes &pound;0 be modified in order to provide as identical an environment
possible. It is chus extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve 100 per
cent compatibility
