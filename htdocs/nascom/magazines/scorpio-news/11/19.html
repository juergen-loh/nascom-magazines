<h4>
IF Statement
</h4>
<p>
Two types of IF UF statement are used in FORTRAN &ndash; the arithmetic form and the
logical form. The arithmetic IF takes the form:
</p>
<p class="center">
IF(expression) L1,L2,L3 (L1,L2 and L3 are statement numbers)
</p>
<p>
If the value of the expression is less than 0, control passes to statement no.
1, if it is equal to 0 then statement no. 2 to and if it is greater than 0,
control passes to the last named statement&nbsp;&ndash;
<table class="fortran-control">
<tr><td>IE(N-1) 3,5,7</td><td>&ndash;</td><td>if the value of N-1 is 0 then control passes
					to the statement label no. 5</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The Logical IF statement has an almost exact parallel in BASIC and it takes the
form:
</p>
<p class="center">
IF(logical expr.) statement
</p>
<p>
The logical expression is evaluated as .TRUE. or .FALSE.; if true, control
passes to the statement immediately following otherwise control passes to the
next program line. The logical expression can contain both logical and
relational operators, which are defined as follows:
</p>
<h5>
Logical operators
</h5>
<p class="center">
.NOT. &nbsp; &nbsp; .AND. &nbsp; &nbsp; .OR, &nbsp; &nbsp; .XOR.
</p>
<h5>
Relational operators
</h5>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
<div class="relational-operators">
<?php columnStart(2); ?>
<table>
<tr><td>.LT.</td><td>less than</td></tr>
<tr><td>.EQ.</td><td>equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td>.GT.</td><td>greater than</td></tr>
</table>
<?php columnChange(2); ?>
<table>
<tr><td>.LE.</td><td>less than or equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td>.NE.</td><td>not equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td>.GE.</td><td>greater than or equal to</td></tr>
</table>
<?php columnEnd(2); ?>
</div>
<p></p>
<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<p>
Relational operators are self explanatory but Logical operators may need a
little clarification.
</p>
<p>
If A and B are logical expressions, then:
</p>
<table class="logical-expressions">
<tr><td>.NOT.A</td><td>is the logical opposite of A (0 bits become 1 and vice versa)
<tr><td>A.AND.B</td><td>the value of this expression is the product (logical) of A and
			B. This implies that the value is .TRUE. if A and B are
			.TRUE. and .FALSE. otherwise</td></tr>
<tr><td>A.OR.B</td><td>this produces the logical sum of A and B. In this case the
			value is .FALSE. if A and B are .FALSE. and .TRUE. otherwise.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A.XOR.B</td><td>the value of this expression is the exclusive OR of A and B.
			Here, the value is .TRUE. if only one of A and B is .TRUE.
			otherwise it is .FALSE..</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>
STOP statement
</h4>
<p>
This is self explanatory. It causes program execution to cease at that point;
if the form:
</p>
<p class="center">
STOP (string of 1 &ndash; 6 characters)
</p>
<p>
is used, then the characters in the string will be printed out on the monitor
and program execution then finishes.
