forward most of their existing software and firmware investment. How about 1e

My final appeal ie that the final issues of 60-BUS News should be spent on
much hardware/toftware information as can be contained between their covers,
Since this is the last opportunity, leaving no spare room for humorous anecdotes

Dear Mr Martin,
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your Letter, it&rsquo;s deen passed to me by Paul, probably because
he thinks Imay be able to give &laquo; more objective anewer, drawing on ay wider
experience of the home computer business, covering scenes from behind the shop
Counter, playing at design engineer (what T&rsquo;was originally trained aa) and at
Supporter &lsquo;of the home computer cause. I have not confined my discussion of Your
Letter to the above but have alsa reread your Letter published in 80-805 vol 3

I feel in general ag
ee certainly benefited from the oviginal conception of the
Nascom&nbsp;2 and then through the ever grouing number of Gi
these machines have grown in power and complexity, go 7
learned to come to terms with them, both in design and software implications
This, tome, has been someching of an uphill struggle and has involved the
Personal investment of many thousands of houes, not &pound;0 say money in acquiring
the machines in the first place. Ok, I did end up with a free Nascom&nbsp;2 from the
Company, but most of the rest has been purchased over the years at only a little
bnore advantageous price than that paid by most ocher people

Im 1977 T knew nothing about computers, they only taught me a
about digital logic when I gained ay HNC in&rsquo;the mid-sixties, and most of this
Study was more applicable to buliding power stations than computers. Nascome
were the start, followed by Geminis, and now (dare I eay it), IBMa, Vax
