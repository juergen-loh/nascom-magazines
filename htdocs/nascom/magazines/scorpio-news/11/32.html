As soon as the first &lt;ESC&gt; Ctrl C is hit, all NEW logons will be refused, but
NDOS Function 41 (User Logon) will be honoured to allow user area changes,
providing the station is already logged on.
</p>
<p>
Once a Closedoun option 2-4 has been selected, an automatic Broadcast is set up
for all logged in Stations, informing them that the system is about to close.
The absence of a &lsquo;*&rsquo; on the Logon display indicates that the Station has
received the broadcast. This automatic message may be re-sent by entering
&lsquo;&lt;ESC&gt; Ctrl C&rsquo; to restore the Closedown menu, and then reselecting the required
option.
