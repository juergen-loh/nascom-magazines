An Introduction to FORTRAN &ndash; by P.D. Coker
</p>
<p>
(in this article, 780 refers to Microsoft FORTEAN-80, ProFortran to the 8-bit
Version of FORTRAN from Prospero Software. NFortran refers to Ellis Computing&rsquo;s
Nevada Fortran and FORTRAN refere to other versions such as FORTRAN IV oF
FORTRAN 77.)
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;WHY USE FORTEAN?
</p>
<p>
FORTRAN 4s, as computer languages go, very old, having first seen the light of
day about 30 years ago asa scientific aad technical high level language for
early ISM mainframes &ndash; it&rsquo;s older than ALGOL and BASIC (which owes a Lot of ite
style to FORTRAN TI} and, by comparivon, PASCAL and C are infants!
</p>
<p>
Most users are avace of the drawbacks of interpreted languages &ndash; particularly in
terms of execurion time&rdquo; FORTRAN is a compiled language in which the source
code 14 written osing # text editor and then compiled into a run-time package
which will execute uch move repidly than isthe case with an interpreted
Tanguage Thee are two disadvantages to this, however. One is that any
amendments which need to be made to the program involve editing and recompiling
the source code which can be tedious&rdquo; fhe other problem :s one of cost
Virtually all compiled languages are expensive (&pound;130 &ndash; 350}, although Hisofe
PASCAL (a very satisfactory version) coses quite alot less&rdquo; There is 9 very
good FORTRAN compiler, sold by Grey Matter of Ashburton, South Devon which 1c
fneredably cheap. For &pound;30 you get wevada Fortean and s useful Guide
admitvedly, the implenentation of FORTRAN ie not complete = but few will mise
the bits the suchor has Lett out!
</p>
<p>
So Sf you are fed-up with your BASIC and want to try a compiled Language, then
it ceatly is worthwhile trying WFortran True, FORTRAN is a little Less
Hexible kad efficient than PASCAL bot the conversion of progrems. from BASIC to
FORTRAN is relatively simple and straightforward T&rsquo;must adalt to. being
professionally biaved in favour of FORTRAN but sone versions of PASCAL are very
Finicky about syntar
</p>
<p>
PROGRAM STRUCTURE
</p>
<p>
In BASIC, program entry 8 very straightforward with Line numbers and statements
typed in directiy but in FORTRAN, the program statenence must first be entered
Uoing # text editor such a6 WordStar (in non-document mode) or PEN before
calling che compzler, &ldquo;All versions of FORTRAN use up to 60 columns per Line of
input, organised as follows:
</p>
<p>
colt 1-5 Optional statement number (1 &ndash; 99999)
cals &lsquo;Continuation&rsquo; character field (used only if the
number of columns used by the statement exceeds 72)
cole 7-72 FORTRAN stacement
Cols 73 &ndash; 80 (can be ased for identafication, rude words or
whatever)
comers,
</p>
<p>
In BASIC, BEM statements (or comments preceded by single quote {*)) can be
used to highlight information about programs. In PORTEAN, &lsquo;the use of = letter C
in column t performs the came function; 1ines so marked are ignored by the
compiler
