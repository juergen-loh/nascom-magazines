(In this article, F80 refers to Microsoft <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>-80, ProFortran to the 8-bit
Version of <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> from Prospero Software. NFortran refers to Ellis Computing&rsquo;s
Nevada Fortran and <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> refere to other versions such as <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> IV oF
<span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> 77.)

<h3 class="uppercase">
Why Use Fortran?
</h3>
<p>
<span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> is, as computer languages go, very old, having first seen the light of
day about 30 years ago as a scientific and technical high level language for
early IBM mainframes&nbsp;&ndash; it&rsquo;s older than ALGOL and BASIC (which owes a lot of its
style to <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> II) and, by comparison, <span class="uppercase">Pascal</span> and C are infants!
</p>
<p>
Most users are aware of the drawbacks of interpreted languages&nbsp;&ndash; particularly in
terms of execution time. <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> is a compiled language in which the source
code is written using a text editor and then compiled into a run-time package
which will execute much move rapidly than is the case with an interpreted
language. There are two disadvantages to this, however. One is that any
amendments which need to be made to the program involve editing and recompiling
the source code which can be tedious. The other problem is one of cost.
Virtually all compiled languages are expensive (&pound;150&nbsp;&ndash; 350), although <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","HiSoft"); ?>
<span class="uppercase">Pascal</span> (a very satisfactory version) costs quite a lot less. There is a very
good <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> compiler, sold by Grey Matter of Ashburton, South Devon which is
incredibly cheap. For &pound;30 you get Nevada Fortran and a useful Guide&nbsp;&ndash;
admittedly, the implementation of <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> is not complete&nbsp;&ndash; but few will miss
the bits the author has left out!
</p>
<p>
So, if you are fed-up with your BASIC and want to try a compiled language, then
it really is worthwhile trying NFortran. True, <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> is a little less
flexible and efficient than <span class="uppercase">Pascal</span> but the conversion of programs from BASIC to
<span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> is relatively simple and straightforward. I must admit to being
professionally biased in favour of <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> but some versions of <span class="uppercase">Pascal</span> are very
finicky about syntax.
</p>
<h3 class="uppercase">
Program Structure
</h3>
<p>
In BASIC, program entry is very straightforward with line numbers and statements
typed in directly but in <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>, the program statements must first be entered
using a text editor such as WordStar (in non-document mode) or PEN before
calling the compiler. All versions of <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> use up to 80 columns per line of
input, organised as follows:
</p>
<table class="fortran-columns">
<tr><td>Cols</td><td>1&nbsp;&ndash; 5</td><td>Optional statement number (1&nbsp;&ndash; 99999)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Col</td><td>6</td><td>&lsquo;Continuation&rsquo; character field (used only if the
                              number of columns used by the statement exceeds 72)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cols</td><td>7&nbsp;&ndash; 72</td><td><span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> statement</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cols</td><td>73&nbsp;&ndash; 80</td><td>(can be used for identification, rude words or
                                           whatever)</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>
<span class="uppercase">Comments</span>
</h3>
<p>
In BASIC, REM statements (or comments preceded by single quote (') can be
used to highlight information about programs. In <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>, the use of a letter C
in column 1 performs the same function; lines so marked are ignored by the
compiler
