(In this article, F80 refers to Microsoft FORTRAN-80, ProFortran to the 8-bit
Version of FORTRAN from Prospero Software. NFortran refers to Ellis Computing&rsquo;s
Nevada Fortran and FORTRAN refere to other versions such as FORTRAN IV oF
FORTRAN 77.)

<h3>
WHY USE FORTRAN?
</h3>
<p>
FORTRAN is, as computer languages go, very old, having first seen the light of
day about 30 years ago as a scientific and technical high level language for
early IBM mainframes &ndash; it&rsquo;s older than ALGOL and BASIC (which owes a lot of its
style to FORTRAN II) and, by comparison, PASCAL and C are infants!
</p>
<p>
Most users are aware of the drawbacks of interpreted languages &ndash; particularly in
terms of execution time. FORTRAN is a compiled language in which the source
code is written using a text editor and then compiled into a run-time package
which will execute much move rapidly than is the case with an interpreted
language. There are two disadvantages to this, however. One is that any
amendments which need to be made to the program involve editing and recompiling
the source code which can be tedious. The other problem is one of cost.
Virtually all compiled languages are expensive (&pound;150 &ndash; 350), although <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","HiSoft"); ?>
PASCAL (a very satisfactory version) costs quite a lot less. There is a very
good FORTRAN compiler, sold by Grey Matter of Ashburton, South Devon which is
incredibly cheap. For &pound;30 you get Nevada Fortran and a useful Guide &ndash;
admittedly, the implementation of FORTRAN is not complete &ndash; but few will miss
the bits the author has left out!
</p>
<p>
So, if you are fed-up with your BASIC and want to try a compiled language, then
it really is worthwhile trying NFortran. True, FORTRAN is a little less
flexible and efficient than PASCAL but the conversion of programs from BASIC to
FORTRAN is relatively simple and straightforward. I must admit to being
professionally biased in favour of FORTRAN but some versions of PASCAL are very
finicky about syntax.

<h3>
PROGRAM STRUCTURE
</h3>
<p>
In BASIC, program entry is very straightforward with line numbers and statements
typed in directly but in FORTRAN, the program statements must first be entered
using a text editor such as WordStar (in non-document mode) or PEN before
calling the compiler. All versions of FORTRAN use up to 80 columns per line of
input, organised as follows:
</p>
<table class="fortran-columns">
<tr><td>Cols</td><td>1 &ndash; 5</td><td>Optional statement number (1 &ndash; 99999)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Col</td><td>6</td><td>&lsquo;Continuation&rsquo; character field (used only if the
                              number of columns used by the statement exceeds 72)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cols</td><td>7 &ndash; 72</td><td>FORTRAN statement</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cols</td><td>73 &ndash; 80</td><td>(can be used for identification, rude words or
                                           whatever)</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>
COMMENTS
</h3>
<p>
In BASIC, REM statements (or comments preceded by single quote (') can be
used to highlight information about programs. In FORTRAN, the use of a letter C
in column 1 performs the same function; lines so marked are ignored by the
compiler
