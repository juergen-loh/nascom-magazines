<p>
EQUIVALENCE (X1),(X2) .. (Xn)
</p>
<p>
= where X1 4m are sequences of two or more variables or array elenents,
Separaced by commas. Thus,
</p>
<p>
EQUIVALENCE (GROT(6),THTSGROT(3,2))
= allows the two arrays to share epace happily.
Variables can also be EQUIVALENCED &ndash;
EQUIVALENCE (4,0)
= te allowed.
Lf EQUIVALENCE Ls used to save program space, then make sure that you do not
fall into the trap of letting one of the equivalenced variables or array
overweite the other(s) The EQUIVALENCE statement is very useful if &laquo; program
</p>
<p>
Contains intermediate varaables or arrays which are not fequired in later&rsquo; stages
of &amp; program
</p>
<p>
&lsquo;The final method of space saving is to use che COMMON block statement in which
arrays and variables which appese in more than one of the program subroutine
fare declared as COMMON at the beginning of each:
</p>
<p>
(COMMON X17 A(20,40),NASTY(100,29
= are put in each subroutine to eave # modicum of space
</p>
<p>
In a Large program this As very handy! In the above example, arrays A and NASTY
are stored &lsquo;ins COMMON aren called 41 This area is shared by aii subroutines
dn &lsquo;which this COMMON statement appears
</p>
<p>
EXTERKAL statement
</p>
<p>
Many functions ace provided in the system Library and can he called up (as in
BASIC) &lsquo;by Lneluding their name &ndash; fof example, SIN, ADS or PEEK (in POO and
Profortren) Bat othert are not available and have to be provided from another
Subroutine or external function &ldquo;The ETERNAL statement docs this by allowing
the programmer to specify the name of the external subroutine that does the
Fequired job &ndash; thus if you wanted to calculate the volume of a cylinder,
Subroutine which provided the area of the top could be called in the EXTERNAL
Statenene as follows:
</p>
<p>
e porry PRooRAM
EXTERNAL CIRCAR
</p>
<p>
&copy; TuIS&rsquo;TS-AN EXTERNALLY SUPPLIED FUNCTION WHICH GIVES THE 4REX
</p>
<p>
&copy; OF A cracLe.
READ( 5, 10) HEIGHT
</p>
<p>
ao FORMAT&rsquo; (F803),
VoL*HETOHTSCIRCAR
WRETE(5,190) VOL.
</p>
<p>
100 FORMAT( CYL&rsquo; VOL 1S *,F6.3, CUBIC METRES")
</p>
<p>
Goo rurs\Ts FINE AS LONG AS ALL CYLINDERS HAVE THE SAME SIZE TOPtI1
&lsquo;END
</p>
<p>
Wote thae if the EXTERNAL statement had been omitted, CERCAR would have been
incorrectly treated as an ordinary REAL variable by the computer
