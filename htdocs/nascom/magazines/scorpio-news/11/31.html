<h3>
MultiNet 1 to MultiNet 2
</h3>
<p>
The original MultiNet 1 software achieved an extremely high level of CP/M
compatibility, but over the 2 years that it was available certain anomalies were
brought to light. In addition a number of possible enhancements became
apparent, and so MultiNet 2 was introduced to improve the CP/M compatibility of
MultiNet and to provide additional facilities. It is available from Gemini
dealers.
</p>
<h3>
SERVER Changes
</h3>
<p>
<u>Auto-serving</u> With MultiNet 2, the Server will automatically start-up network
operation, unless within the first few seconds the user depresses a key on the
Server, in which case it becomes available for maintenance purposes or stand-alone
use.
</p>
<p>
<u>64K systems</u> If Server load is deliberately aborted then the user is presented
with a conventional Gemini 64K CP/M environment, as opposed to the special
buffered system that the network software runs under.
</p>
<p>
<u>Larger Winchesters</u> The maximum possible number of MultiNet users is increased to
94 to allow the use of 3 logical drives (i.e. Wiachesters up to 3 x 8 MByres) &ndash; 24
MBytes).
</p>
<p>
<u>Faster screen response</u> All Server screen updates are now done using direct
screen-addressing to speed system operation.
</p>
<p>
<u>Free space displayed</u> The amount of free space on the Server drives my
optionally be displayed on the Server display.
</p>
<p>
<u>Spooling changes</u> The Spool queue length (i.e number of files awaiting printing)
is always displayed and is updated whenever the length of the queue changes.
</p>
<p>
<u>Additional Server features</u><br>
An operator is now permitted to perform certain functions on the Server while it
is in operation. These are all initiated by typing &lt;ESC&gt; followed by a Control
character.
</p>
<table class="multinet-esc-ctrl">
<tr><td>&lt;ESC&gt; &nbsp; Ctrl B</td><td>Broadcast Message</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;ESC&gt; &nbsp; Ctrl C</td><td>Initiate system closedown</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;ESC&gt; &nbsp; Ctrl D</td><td>Display Directory space</td></tr>
</table>
<h4>
Broadcast Message
</h4>
<p>
The operator may enter an message of up to 50 characters to be broadcast to
selected (or all) stations that ace currently logged on. Once the message is
set up, the operator is prompted to enter the numbers of the Stations that are
to receive the Broadcast If the character &lsquo;A&rsquo; is encountered, it is understood
as ALL, and all logged in Stations will receive the broadcast. An asterisk &lsquo;*&rsquo;
is placed on the Server Logon display between the Station no. and User no. to
indicate that the system is waiting to broadcast to that destination. At this
time the screen display is altered to indicate that broadcast is in progress.
When the broadcast has been accepted by an individual Station, the &lsquo;*&rsquo; on the
Logon display is changed back to a &lsquo;.&rsquo; as normal. When all specified Stations
have accepted the broadcast, the bottom portion of the screen is cleared and the
Server is ready to accept further keyboard commands.
</p>
<p>
It is important to note that as the user stations cannot accept &lsquo;unsolicited&rsquo;
network messages, the broadcast can only be sent when the Station next sends a
request to the Server. Thus if a Station is left logged on but unused, it will
not receive the broadcast. This is the reason for putting the &lsquo;*&rsquo; into the
Station logon display.
</p>
<h4>
System Closedown
</h4>
<p>
It i now possible to control the shutdown of the network. The following options
are available:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>
1)&nbsp;&ndash;</td><td>Shut-down immediately. In this instance all Server buffers are flushed,
and Server operation is aborted. A confirmatory &lsquo;Y&rsquo; is requested.
</td></tr>
