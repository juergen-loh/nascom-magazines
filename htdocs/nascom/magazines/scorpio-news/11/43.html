DOCUMENTATION
</h3>
<p>
This is adequate and consists of a detailed explanation of the port allocations
and their functions, program examples for the insertion of support for the
<?php externalLink("MAP80 VFC","VFC"); ?>
into a CP/M BIOS or interfacing the VFC with NAS-SYS, and details of the control
codes which the VFC recognizes. In view of the large number of possible
combinations of VFC and Nascom&nbsp;2/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>
<?php externalLink("MAP80 CPU","MAP CPU"); ?> or
<?php externalLink("MAP80 VFC","FDC"); ?> cards, the implementation
notes are quite extensive. They are also easy to follow which makes a pleasant
change from some systems; unfortunately, no details are included for the Nascom&nbsp;1
and I gather that there are difficulties in using the VFC with it. In the
full version, 15 or so links are involved but not all of these have to be used.
Details are also given of modifications which need to be carried out if RAM
boards (Gemini and Nascom) are to be used. No modifications are needed if the
MAP RAM card is used. A final section gives details of pin assignments on the
VFC and a useful note on TEAC, Pertec end Micropolis drive pin assignments.
</p>
<p>
If the fully implemented VFC or the FDC-only system is purchased, MAP-80 Systems
can supply s fully licensed version of CP/M&nbsp;2.2 or 3.0 with a customised BIOS.
This is supplied with a short instruction manual which explains how linkages are
made or modified on the various types of CPU cards, gives details of disk error
messages as well as how to customise the BIOS for other features. Both parallel
and serial printer output and screen editing using ^@ are supported A special
boot PROM is supplied which replaces the RP/M boot EPROM if the CPU card it a
<?php externalLink("GM813","",""); ?>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the usual CP/M files on the disk, and the customised MOVCPM.COM
or CPM3.SYS, a multi-utility program is supplied, which allows users to format,
verify or copy disks. MAP will also customise existing users&rsquo; CP/M on request
at a reasonable cost.

<h3>
THE VFC IN USE
</h3>
<p>
The fully implemented card has two 3 pin connectors for the video input and
output, which are incompatible with the Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM812"); ?>
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
video output which is a
standard jack socket requiring an enormous plug. Why Gemini use this gargantuan
means of taking out the video puzzles me since Nascom found some small coaxial
connectors for their
<?php externalLink("AVC"); ?>
which are really neat. I&rsquo;m not all that keen on MAP-80&rsquo;s
connector either and I&rsquo;m sure that there must be all sorts of impedance
mismatches since neither type is likely to approach 75 ohms or whatever a
monitor is supposed to need to produce a good display. The keyboard and disk
drives are plugged in to the board &ndash; using non-latched ID connectors which are a
little difficult to unplug when needed.
</p>
<p>
On booting up, a systen message is displayed together with the CP/M prompt;
commands may then be entered. The display is 80 columns wide and because of the
alternative character set, both normal or reverse (black on white) characters
can be displayed, or an alternative character set which can be programmed into a
<?php externalLink("2716"); ?> or <?php externalLink("2732"); ?> EPROM and plugged into the second ROM socket.
</p>
<p>
The memory-mapped display appears to be quite fast and free from visible
interference as a consequence of CPU and CRT controller interaction; as has
already been mentioned, the Gemini video controllers have Z80 CPUs on board and
under certain circumstances on the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
some interference can take place which
produces a faint diagonal patterning on the screen &ndash; which can be irritating
under some screen display conditions. The cause possibly lies in the layout of
the
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?>
board where one or two long-ish tracks radiated noise which was picked
up by other parts of the system. This problem appears to have been resolved
with the Gemini
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
which has a much more legible screen display than its
predecessor.
</p>
<p>
I experienced no problems with the floppy disk controller when using Pertec (48
TPI) and TEAC, Canon or Mitsubishi (96 TPI) drives &ndash; which are plug-compatible.
The Mitsubishi drives were quietest in operation. Some problems were
experienced when using 96 TPI Micropolis drives &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure why &ndash; perhaps
they objected to the fast track stepping rate which suits the TEAC and
