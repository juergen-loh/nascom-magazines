since MBASIC is both expensive and long in the tooth. It would be very
interesting to compare the speed and accuracy of the Microsoft compatible
Mallard BASIC. I understand that it is substantially faster then Microsoft,
presumably because it is written in Z80 rather than <?php externalLink("8080"); ?> code.

<p>
The trigonometric functions produced penalties in all cases in both accuracy
and/or speed. If the program was run without them, the result war very close to
2500 in all but one case (HP4) &ndash; with a range of 2499.69 co 2501.03. The
timings were halved (approximately). HP4 gave a result of 2472.00; rather a
surprising lack of accuracy, attributable in the main to lower precision
arithmetic.

In this particular application, there is very little access, apart from console
operations, to whatever operating systems is in use and one is effectively
comparing the console performances of the CP/M machines. I did try the
ProPascal version of the Dobbs benchmark on a Research Machines 380Z-D; it took
124 secs to complete &ndash; about 20% slower than on the 80-BUS machines.

It will be fairly obvious that a benchmark test is not the &ldquo;be-all and end-all&rdquo;
neither is it an infallible guide to which language should be used on your
machine. For most non-professional users, the question of a second language may
not arise unless they go for <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","HiSoft"); ?> PASCAL &ndash; and the professional way be using
applications packages written in one language which are not available in any of
the others.
</p>
<p>
From my own experience, I must say that differences in timing due to
architectural/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>configuration features among any of the 80-BUS machines are small,
provided that they are running the same version of CP/M (in my case 2.2). CP/M
3.0 (CP/M PLUS) is available for all 80-BUS machines provided that at least 128K
of RAM (for its banked memory function) and Gemini or MAP 80 video and floppy
disk controllers are available in the system. It is a delight to use and has
many handy facilities which make it much more versatile than CP/M&nbsp;2.2. It does
increase the speed of execution of these benchmarks a little (up to 5 or 6%); in
terms of real-time applications, this smell saving in time may be worth
considering. I&rsquo;m also very glad that I don&rsquo;t have too much to do with CP/M as
used on the BBC/TORCH. It has some nice facilities but it is incredibly slow.
CP/M, for all its snags, is supercharged by comparison!
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, then, the choice is dictated by the application for which you will
be running most of your programs. Few people will want to carry out several
thousand trig. operations but it does imply that a slow performance in the
benchmarks given in this article will be a disadvantage when running programs in
which a lot of use is made of graphics. The same is likely to be true of
programs in which there is a significant amount of &lsquo;number crunching&rsquo;, and
accuracy (or the lack of it) may be a serious problem.

<p>
I haven&rsquo;t yet come across a benchmark which will test the speed of string
handling, and disk i/o tests will depend crucially upon the type of drive,
stepping rate, type of FDC and such software horrors as the efficiency of the
8080 code and the way in which data is written to and read from the disk.
There&rsquo;s a lot to be said for using a virtual disk of some of the newer 96TPI
drives with 3 ms stepping rates, a great improvement on the Micropolis&rsquo; 10 ms
and Pertec&rsquo;s 25 ms. It would appear that the
<?php externalLink("HSA-88B"); ?>
offers a lot of scope for
increased speed and (possibly) accuracy but costs as much as or more than many
compilers. It would be interesting to see how a 16 bit FORTRAN or PASCAL copes
with the Dobbs Benchmark both with and without the aid of the 8087 arithmetic
co-processor that can be added to the GM888.
</p>
<p>
By way of a postscript, the performance of the obsolete UK101 was quite
impressive and supports my feeling that ROM BASICs on <?php externalLink("6502"); ?> machines tend to be
rather more efficient than either disk or ROM BASICS on the majority of 8080/Z80
machines. I had, some time ago, run the first of the programs mentioned in this
article on a UK101 running at 2 NHz and it pottered through in about 40 seconds.
