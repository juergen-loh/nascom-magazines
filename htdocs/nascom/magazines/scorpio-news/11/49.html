FOR ..NEXT or their FORTRAN of PASCAL equivalent DO loops work faster if
unnecessary arithmeric is reduced &ndash; so constants can be placed outside the loop.
Tells also quicker to dispense with loops altogether in some cases where, for
example, an array has to be initialised.

The vorst offenders in almost all respects are programs originally written for
</p>
<p>
wainframe computers in which memory restraints are almost unknown and the clock
Speed and cycle time are such that even inefficiently-written programe run
extremely quickly. Good programe, regardless of their function or the Langua
fn which they are written, should take into account most, if not all of the
points raised in this article during their development The extra time snd care
Involved will certainly not be wasted!
