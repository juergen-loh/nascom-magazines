<h3>
STATEMENT NUMBERS.
</h3>
<p>
In most BASICs, it in necessary to give each line of the program an identifying
line number in ascending sequence since lines are interpreted on an incremental
basis. FOR&shy;TRAN differs since only certain statements are required to have
numbers and program execution does not depend upon a numerical sequence but on
the way in which statements are arranged &ndash; it starts at the first line and
finishes at the last! Statement numbers are usually only required. during loop
operations, data I/O of where control has to be passed to another part of the
propram.
</p>
<h3>
CONTINUATION LINES
</h3>
<p>
There are occasions when text headings or complicated expressions or layouts are
used in a program where the space available for the statement (cols 7-72) is
insufficient. A continuation line (or lines) needs to be used to accommodate
the additional material; in such case, a character must be typed in column 6
and columns 1 &ndash; 5 left blank. Usually the first continuation line is labelled
With an &lsquo;A&rsquo; the second with a &lsquo;B&rdquo; and so on; the figures 0 &ndash; 9 could also be
used if there are a lot of continuation Lines and F90 and ProFortran place no
restriction, unlike some Mainframes where a limit of 10 &ndash; 20 is quite common.
It is allowable, but not good practice to use the same symbol for succeeding
lines. The normal use of only 72 columns is a hangover from the days of
teletypes and was maintained when the majority of input was in the form of
punched cards.
</p>
<h3>
PROGRAM ENTRY
</h3>
<p>
It is perfectly possible to write small FOR&shy;TRAN programs on the back of an
envelope before typing then into your micro &ndash; but a great deal easier if you use
a proper coding form for the purpose in which the various columns and fields are
shown; a typical example is shown in fig&nbsp;1. A flow chart is useful when
constructing a new program, note that control characters which the text editor
may insect MUST BE REMOVED &ndash; the compiler tends to get uppity if it receives ^U
or ^G. The program must not be formatted in any way and I would not recommend
the use of DR&rsquo;s ED which is only for the masochists &ndash; PEN, WordStar or <?php externalLink("HiSOFT","HiSoft",""); ?>&rsquo;s
ED are such better
</p>
<p>
The statement must start in or after column 7 of each Line, with a statement
label if needed in columns 1 &ndash; 5; the &lsquo;tab&rsquo; facility could be used if one has a
dislike of using the space bar although this will usually start the statement in
column 9. If a continuation line is required, column 6 must be used as noted
earlier; program statements must finish in or before column 72 unless a
continuation line is to be used.

<h3>
DATA NAMES AND TYPES
</h3>
<p>
FOR&shy;TRAN defines data specifically by name and, unlike most forms of BASIC, by
type.
</p>
<p>
There are four names for data; constants (such as an explicitly stated numbers
or pieces of data); variables &ndash; which are symbolically identified pieces of
data; arrays which are ordered sets of data in 1,2 or 3 dimensions and array
elements which refer to one member of the set of data in an array.
</p>
<p>
Date types may be Integer, Real, Double Precision, Logical or Hollerith.
</p>
<p>
INTEGER types are precise representations of whole numbers, positive, negative
or zero in the range &ndash;32768 to +32767 and have a precision of 5 digits.
</p>
<p>
REAL types are approximations of real numbers, to 7+ significant digits which
may have a magnitude lying between 10^-38 and 10^38 (or 2^-127 and 2^127).
