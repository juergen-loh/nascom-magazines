STATEMENT MOMBERS.

<p>
Hp most BASICH, it in necessary to give each Line of the program an identifying
Line number in &lsquo;ascendi i don an incremental

CONTINUATION LIMES
</p>
<p>
There are occasions vhen text headings or complicated expressions or layouts are
Used &ldquo;ins program where the space avallable for the statement (colt 7-72) 18
Inguflciene. A continuation line (or Lines) needs to be ured to accommodate
the additional material; in such case, a character must be typed in column 8
and columns 1 &ldquo;5 Lefe blank Usually &lsquo;the first continuation tine is labelled
With an &lsquo;a&rsquo; the second with a &lsquo;B&rdquo; and so on; the figurer 0 &ndash; 9 could also be
Used if there are a lot of continuation Lines and P90 and Profortran place no

Ie is perfectly possible to write email FORTRAN prograas on the back of an
envelope before typing then into your micro &ndash; but a great deal easier if you use
Sproper coding form for the purpose in which the various columns and fields are
Shown, a typical example is shown in fig 1 A flow chart is useful vhen
Constructing a new program, note that control characters vhich the text editor
nay. insect MUST BE REMOVED &ndash; the compiler tends to get uppity 1f it receives &ldquo;U
or /"G. The program must not be formatted in any vay and 1 would not recommend
the use of Dk&rsquo;s 2D which is only for the masochiers &ndash; PEM, Wordstar of MiSofe&rsquo;s
ED are such better
</p>
<p>
The statement must start in or after column 7 of each Line, with # stat:
lubel if needed in columns 1 &ndash; 3; the &ldquo;tabr facility could be used Lf)
Gislike of using the space bar although this will usually start the stat
Column 9. Tf acontinuarion line is required, coluan @ must be used as noted
eaclier; program statements must finish in or before column 72 uate
Continuation Line is to be ured.

<p>
DATA MAMES AND TYPES
</p>
<p>
FORTRAN defines data epecifically by name and, unlike most forms of BASIC, by
type:
</p>
<p>
There are four names for data, constants (such as an explicitly stated numbers
or pieces of data). variables &ndash; vhich are symbolically identified pieces of
Gata; arrays which are ordered sets of data in 1,2 or 3 dimensions and array
Clements which refer to one member of the eet of data in an arra}
</p>
<p>
Date types may be Integer, Real, Double Precision, Logical or Hollerith.
</p>
<p>
INTEGER types are precise representations of whole mumbers, positive, negative
&lsquo;of zero inthe range -32768 &pound;0 43276) and have &laquo; precision of 5 digit
</p>
<p>
REAL types are approximations of real numbers, to 7+ significant digits which
may have a magnitude lying between 10&rsquo;-38 and 10&rsquo;38 (or 2*-127 and 27127).
