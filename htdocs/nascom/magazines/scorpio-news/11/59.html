T understand that this version of BASIC86 (5.21) is the genuine, non-patched
article but the version number is exactly the sane as ny version of MBASIC

Factors affecting Benchmark timings

<p>
Several factors will ultimately affect the timing (and accuracy) of &laquo; Benchmark
test:

<p>
Hardware
systen configuration and architecture vill have important effects on disk i/o,

<p>
memory and screen access timings. Unless a test is specifically designed to
test these, their usage should be as low a8 possible.

&lsquo;The use of a compiled Language rather than one vhich is interpreted will always
Speed things up and the accuracy will aot be affected. The main problem at far
ae both accuracy and speed ace concerned lies in the efficiency of the
Gigorithas which are used by the particular version of BASIC or whatever
language, and the extent to which rounding excore may affect the results of
calculations
</p>
<p>
Om micros, most BASICS work (in single precision) to an accuracy of 8 digits but
the BBC version uses 9 digits and CBASIC, 14. Rounding errors will be
marginally 1 iais and uch ieee in ie digit, &lsquo;alenaugh, the

Tees). My FORTRAN teste used the latter approach.

<p>
&lsquo;The Z80 version of BBC BASIC appears to be a lot faster and only margis
accurate than the 6502 version. It is available for 60-BUS machin
