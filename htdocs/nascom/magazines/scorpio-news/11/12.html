<h3>
<span class="uppercase">Assingments</span>
</h3>
<p>
This is the correct way of describing statements which contain an &lsquo;equals&rsquo; sign.
The use of the &lsquo;&minus;&rsquo; sign in <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> is exactly the same as in BASIC and <span class="uppercase">Pascal</span>.
</p>
<h3 class="uppercase">
Arithmetic Operators
</h3>
<p>
Again, this is the correct way of describing the +, &ndash;, *, /, and ** operators.
The first four are familiar enough in BASIC but the fifth replaces the &lsquo;up-arrow&rsquo;
used to indicate exponentiation. The order in which the operators work
is follows &ndash; from left to right in three sweeps; these deal respectively with
any exponentiation, followed by multiplication or division and finally the
addition or subtraction. There is no precedence between addition and
subtraction or division and multiplication and the use of parentheses (brackets)
can be used to emphasize or change the natural order which has just been
described. Again, there is no difference between BASIC end <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>.

<h3>
ARRAYS
</h3>
<p>
Arrays are characterised by having 1, 2 of 3 dimensions (or more in some
versions of <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>!). The size of an array must therefore be declared
explicitly at the beginning of a program or subroutine, by using the <span class="uppercase">Dimension</span>
statement in which the array name (1-6 characters, the first of which is a
letter) and its dimensions are stated. The process is broadly similar to BASIC
and the relevant programs line appears thus:
</p>
<pre class="center">
DIMENSION SQUARE(10,10),CUBE(5,4,3),LINE(20)
</pre>
<p>
gives the dimensions of two REAL arrays and one <span class="uppercase">Integer</span> array; <span class="uppercase">Square</span> has two
dimensions with a maximum of 100 elements, CUBE has three dimensions and 60
elements and LINE is single dimension linear array (vector) which can store up
to 20 <span class="uppercase">Integer</span> values only, just as CUBE and SQUARE can only store REAL numbers.
If the <span class="uppercase">Dimension</span> statement is preceded by an explicit variable declaration &ndash;
such as making CUBE an integer variable, the array CUBE becomes capable of
holding only integer data. The values in brackets after the array name are
referred to as subscripts and identify the array elements, on the first occasion
that an array (3 declared, the dimensions muse be numerical but if the array is
required in a subroutine (the <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> &lsquo;equivalent&rsquo; of the GOSUB &ndash; RETURN or the
PROCedure in other versions of BASIC), these numerical values can be replaced by
letters or other variable names provided these have been given a value before
the subroutine is called. The value of the subscript should be adequate to deal
with the anticipated amount of data so that if 105 values are input into array
SQUARE, there will be an overflow and program execution will cease. One
dimension and two dimension arrays are fairly straightforward and are widely
used in BASIC, and the method of accessing a particular array element is
identical in <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span>. The threw dimension array is simply a series of two-dimension
arrays arranged in &lsquo;layers&rsquo;. In the example given above, CUBE
consists of 3 &lsquo;layers&rsquo;, each with 5 rows and 4 columns, so that CUBE(4,3,2) =
10.5 indicates that the array element in the fourth row of the third column in
the second layer has the value 10.5 assigned to it and CUBE(5,4,3) = &minus;1.5
indicates that the very last element (row 5, column 4, layer 3) has the value &minus;1.5
assigned to it.

<p>
It is possible to reduce storage requirements by three methods, one relies upon
the different amount of storage required by each data type. One REAL data value
occupies 4 bytes, <span class="uppercase">Double Precision</span> takes 8 bytes, <span class="uppercase">Integer</span> takes 2 and <span class="uppercase">Logical</span>, 1
byte. Space can be saved by making sure that data is given an appropriate type
&ndash; serial numbers, for example can be stored as integers rather than real
numbers. Another method uses the <span class="uppercase">Equivalence</span> statement in which arrays can
share the same storage area &ndash; preferably if they are of the same type (integer,
or real). The statement has the general form:
