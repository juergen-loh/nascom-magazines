the correct way of describing statement which contain an &lsquo;equals&rsquo; sign.
Sign in FORTRAN is exactly the same ae in BASIC and PASCAL

<p>
&lsquo;ARITHMETIC OPERATORS.

<p>
Again, thie is the cor of describing the +, -, #, /, and *# operators:
the first four are familiar enough in BASIC but the fifth&rsquo; replaces the &ldquo;up-arrow
uted co indicate exponentiation. The order in which thw operators werk
ies follows &ndash; fron lefe to right in three sweeps; these deal respectively with
any exponentiation, followed by multiplication or division and finally the
dition or subtraction. There is no precedence between addition and
Subtraction or division and multiplication and the use of parentheses (brackets)
Gan be used to emphasize or change the natural order which hae Juat been,
described. again, there is no difference between BASIC end FORTRAN.

Arrays are characterised by having 1, 2 of 3 dimensions (or more in some
Versions of FORTRAW!). The size of an arcay must therefore be declared
explicitly at the beginning of &laquo; program or subroutine, by using the DIMENSION
statement in which the arfay name (1-6 characters, the first of which is a
[etter) and its dimensions are stated. The process is broadly similar to BASIC
</p>
<p>
and the relevant programs line appears thus:
</p>
<p>
DIMENSION SQUARE(10,10),CUBE(S,4,3),LINE(20)
</p>
<p>
gives the dimensions of two REAL arrays and one INTEGER array; SQUARE has two
Sinensions with a maximum of 100 elements, CUBE has three dimensions and 60
Clements and LINE Les single dimension Linea attay (vector) which can atore up
fo 20 INTECER values only.&rdquo; just av CUSE and SQUARE can only store REAL numbers
If the DIMENSION statement is preceded by an explicit variable declaration &ndash;
such as making CUBE an integer variable, the array CUBE becomes capable of
holding only sateger data the values in brackett after the array name Are
Feferced to as subscripte end identify the acray elements, on the first oceasion
that an array {3 declared, the dimensions muse be numerical but if the array is
Fequired. in a subroutine (the FORTRAN &lsquo;equivalent&rsquo; of the GOSUB &ndash; RETURN or the
PROCedure In other versions of BASIC), chese numerical values can be replaced by
Tetters or other variable names provided these have been given a value before
the subroutine ie called The value of the subscript should be adequate to desl
with the anticipated amount of data so that Lf 108 values are input into array &ndash;
SQUARE, there will be an overflow and program execution will cease One
dimension and two dimension arrays are feirly straightforward and are widely
Used in BASIC, and the method of accessing &amp; particular array element is
identical in FORTRAN The threw dimension arcay ir simply a series of tYo-dimension
arrays arranged in &ldquo;layers&rdquo; In the example given above, CUBE
consists of) &lsquo;layers&rsquo;, each with 5 rows and 4 columns, so &ldquo;that CUBE(&laquo;,3,2) =
10&rsquo;S indicates chat the&rsquo; array element in the fourth row of the third column in
the second layer has the value 105 assigned to it and CUBE(3.4.3) = &ndash;1 5
indicnces thae the very last elesent (row 5 &lsquo;column c, layer 3) has the value &ndash;
I&rsquo;S assigned to at

It is possible to reduce storage requirements by three methods, one relies upon
the different amount of storage required by each data type. One REAL data value
occupies &laquo; bytes, DOUBLE PRECISION takes 8 bytes. INTEGER cakes 2 and LOGICAL, 1
byte&rdquo; &ldquo;Space can be saved by making sure that data is given an appropriate type
-"Serial numbers, for example can be stored as integers cather than real
fumbers. &ldquo;Another method uses the EQUIVALENCE statement in vhich arrays can
Share the same storage area &ndash; preferably if they are of the same type (integer,
or real), The statement has the general&rsquo; form:
