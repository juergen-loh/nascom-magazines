What was even more surprising was the ability of the <?php externalLink("6502"); ?> (bog-standard 1MHz
version) to run at 2MHz. Most 2&nbsp;MHz Z80s tend to wilt if you attempt to run
then at 4&nbsp;MHz &ndash; maybe the device speed selection criteria are more stringent
these days.

I was also quite impressed with COMAL-80&rsquo;s timing &ndash; it was by far the fastest of
the languages tested and its accuracy was pretty reasonable as well. I&rsquo;ve never
understood why COMAL has never &lsquo;caught on&rsquo; in this country &ndash; it&rsquo;s very popular
in Denmark and is fairly easy to get on with.
