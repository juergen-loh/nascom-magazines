rotation by an index hole which marks the start of all of the tracks on the
Glek, This index hole passes over an optical sensor, once every revolution of

Two standards have evolved for the number of tracks on 4 5.25&Prime; disk These are
43 tracks per inch (tpi) and 96 tpi although drives are now available which will
achieve 192 tpi The useful recording aren of a 5.25&Prime; disk 4s just under one
inch band and #0 40 or 80 track drives are usual although we all know of the
Gemini and Superbrain 35 track 48 tpi formate, when the earliest drives had only
that number of tracks Ie is fairly obvious that in order to increase the number

Consider, for a moment, the Gemini QDDS disk format. Diake in this format have
two sides, 60 tracks per side with ten 512 byte sectors per track. The sides are
pumbered 0 and 1, the tracks are numbered 0 to 79 and the sectors are numbered 0
to&rdquo;. On some systems, the sector numbering atarte at tector 1 to thet the
Bectors would be numbered from 1 to 10. Some computer manufacturers start vith
Other numbers but G and 1 are the most common velvet track and
tector information is physically written to the diek during formatting so that
the disk controller chip can identify the current side, track and vector by

Sector skew and its companion sector translation are used to improve access
times when reading from Or writing toe disk, Imagine that a disk has its
sectors numbered sequentially from say 0 to 9 and that we wish to read sectors 0
and 1 in that order&rsquo; Having found and read sector 0, there will probably be &amp;
delay while the processor is deciding that the next sector it wante 18 #ector 1
Meanuhile che disk will still be turping and by the time that &laquo; request is sent
tothe disk controller to read sector 1, that sector will have probably passed
under the disk head and the controller will have to wait until sector 1 comes
around again To overcome this problem, some manufacturers including Gemini
iisks sectors to be physically skewed during formatting. If ve look at
4a track on the disk, the sector tumbers&rsquo; aay Look Like thii

Sector translation uses # similar principle to sector skew except that it i 8
Software measure to achieve the sane result. With sector translation, a table of
sector numbers is held in the computer memory. This table may look Like that
