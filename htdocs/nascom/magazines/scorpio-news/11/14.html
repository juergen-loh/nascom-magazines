This is not the the DATA statement in a BASIC program. The function in
FORTRAN is to allow the programmer to set up initial valuer

the GOSUB- RETURN statements have
BASIC uses PROCeduces which are
difference between SUBROUTINES
them, the SUBROUTINE is CALLed by name u
progeam statements contained in it have been processed, control
fothe gain program by means of a RETURN statement. Typical
Subroutine are where a series of tables have to be set up OF where graphical
Gata has to be displayed or a complicated expression has to be evaluated
FUNCTIONs &lsquo;are used differently. The function name appears as one of the
Variables in an assignment statement and the value af the function (at
Eaiculated) le used in the evaluation of the assignment. For example, 1f the
Value of pi is required for some calculations involving the area oF
Circumference of a circle and the version of FORTRAN you are using does not
supply this as one of ite intrinsic functions, then a FUNCTION subprogcam could
bevwritten to provide it (only &laquo; dodo would actually do this but itis good
