<h3>
DATA statement
</h3>
<p>
This is not the the DATA statement in a BASIC program. The function in
<span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> is to allow the programmer to set up initial values for variables before
program execution occurs. For example, the value of frequently used constants
could be initialised in this way:
</p>
<pre class="center">
DATA PI/3.142/,BEANS/5.0/.....
</pre>
<p>
Im each case the variable name is followed by a solidus (/), the value of the
variable, another solidus and separated from the next name by a comma.
</p>
<h3 class="uppercase">
Statement Ordering
</h3>
<p>
It is most important, particularly with type declarations and array
declarations, to ensure that these are put in in the correct sequence before ANY
executable program statements.
</p>
<p>
A suitable order for most <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> versions is:
</p>
<p class="indent">
REAL<br>
INTEGER<br>
<span class="uppercase">Double Precision</span><br>
LOGICAL<br>
DIMENSION<br>
COMMON<br>
EXTERNAL<br>
EQUIVALENCE<br>
DATA<br>
.<br>
. &nbsp; (executable statements)<br>
.<br>
END
</p>
<p>
This applies to both main program and all subroutines but not all of these will
be required for most programs (thank goodness!).

<h3>
<span class="uppercase">Subroutines</span> and <span class="uppercase">Functions</span>
</h3>
<p>
These are program sub-units which are called by the main program as required.
They do not occur in precisely the same form in most versions of (where
the GOSUB&hellip;RETURN statements have an approximately similar operation)&nbsp;&ndash; BBC
BASIC uses PROCeduces which are a closer approximation. There is an essential
difference between <span class="uppercase">Subroutine</span>s and <span class="uppercase">Function</span>s in the way the main program uses
them, the <span class="uppercase">Subroutine</span> is CALLed by name using the CALL statement and when the
program statements contained in it have been processed, control is passed back
to the gain program by means of a RETURN statement. Typical uses for a
subroutine are where a series of tables have to be set up or where graphical
data has to be displayed or a complicated expression has to be evaluated.
<span class="uppercase">Functions</span> are used differently. The function name appears as one of the
variables in an assignment statement and the value of the function (at
calculated) is used in the evaluation of the assignment. For example, if the
value of pi is required for some calculations involving the area or
circumference of a circle and the version of <span class="uppercase">Fortran</span> you are using does not
supply this as one of its intrinsic functions, then a <span class="uppercase">Function</span> subprogram could
be written to provide it (only a dodo would actually do this but it is a good
illustration!):
