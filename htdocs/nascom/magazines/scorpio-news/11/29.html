&lsquo;As can be seen from the examples, there are gaps containing zero and/or SEH
bytes beeween the 1D blacks and da &lsquo;Defore ane after the index mark (if
present) and at the end of the trac gape are there co allow the FDC to
Synchronize with the disk to read the data and ID blocks.
</p>
<p>
The gaps before the index mark and at the end of the track are known
The gap after the sadex mark and before the first ID block is known
Gap Peeparaces, &lsquo;TD block from Its ascoctated data area while Gap 3
</p>
<p>
Separates the data area from the next ID block on the disk.
</p>
<p>
The values of the bytes used to create the gaps are different for single density
and double deneity mades as are the number of bytes uted. Below is an extract
from the manufacturers data sheet for the PD1797 showing the byte values and
byte counts for the gaps. The values shown for the byte count# are minimum
except where shown.

The physical data is held on the disk surface as # serial data stream. In double
density mode a 250s pulse is cont to the disk drive for each flux transition
This would imply that a pulse is sent to the drive each time the data changed
from Otol or 1 to0. Inaddition to the data, a clock 1a recorded on the disk
surface This clock {s picked off when reading the disk to synchronize the date
being read. The presence of a clock on the disk ig ured to good effect by the
FDI797 &lsquo;when sending control bytes to che disk.

Yalues OALH and OC2H on the dlck surface. However, #0 that these bytes can be
&lsquo;Meeinguished from data bytes of the same values, clock pulses ace delibecately
