Putting on the Style by P.D. Coker

<p>
of the more grisly aspects of computing is to read some of the glos
ngazines sold for the profit of the publishers and the edification(!) of the
Users of plastic box computers. Apart from the ada&nbsp;, the program listing
often so dreadfully or denrely printed in minuscule type that it isa
business trying either to read them or (worse) type them in. Hulti-statement
Tinee up to 250 or vo characters in length do Little for one&rsquo;s understanding of
program logic!
</p>
<p>
Quite &laquo; number of commercially published programs appear to have been written in
Such # way that only the gost dedicated hacker&rsquo; will try to disentangle the
program logic &ndash; the reason being to discourage the phanton fiddler; such
Eschniques are co be deplored as ave prograns wich are Inadequacely documented
</p>
<p>
There axe four basic properties that any computer program should have,
dless of whether it&rsquo;ig to be offered for sale, placed in the public domin
fed by the originator for his own purposes.
</p>
<p>
1 Te should be Logically constructed ble (Le, able to run without a

<p>
great deal of modification on many

yor
aa
</p>
<p>
Tt should be easy to follow and well documented
</p>
<p>
3. Tt should work properly, giving correct answers or behaving in the manner
indicated by the author.
</p>
<p>
4 Te should run without excessive demands upon memory or CPU time.
</p>
<p>
[A good program should be constructed so that {t is user friendly at all et
Fegrettably, few are. Brown and Sampyon (1973) compare # good program with an
</p>
<p>
fable, Terge dog &ndash; not easily raffled, slow to take offense and difficult to
Sivert from its chosen course (they don&rsquo;t mention the large appetite of Large
Gogs &ndash; excessive processing time or memory usage, perhaps?) A little unfairly,
they go om to liken most peoples&rsquo; efforts at progranming to pacdler (very
Hinniky about theit food, demanding only the very best and tactieat titbies,
very quick-tempered, easily upset and generally more trouble then they are
Worth) Ali thie is possibly unfalr to poodles but does apply to most software
that &ldquo;I have seen (and&rsquo;ea&rsquo;a loc T have weitvent}. The worst offenders seem to be
Authors of programs in BASIC, closely followed by FORTRAN and PASCAL
Practieioners
</p>
<p>
Good Design
</p>
<p>
Many of us, when faced with a problem which needs the attention of s computer,
fend to jumpin feet firet with a cash of statements in whatever language we
think we are most proficient at using. This ien&rsquo;t the best vay except for the
most trivial applications
</p>
<p>
Define the problem &ndash; what it Ly and the best way to go about It.
</p>
<p>
good program already available which will do what you vant (or which can be
y amended for this purpose)? Do you know what you want to do
</p>
<p>
computer can help you do it &ndash; there 12 no point in erying to write a database
</p>
<p>
program 1f you don&rsquo;t know what a database is. Do you really need tose &amp;
</p>
<p>
or would s few minutes with a celculator seive just a well? If you
</p>
<p>
+ would your data be in an appropriate form or does it
</p>
<p>
Having defined the problem, one should then outline the program, specifying its
purpose, the types of data input and cutput, the variables to be included and
Ehe &lsquo;matkematice which may be Reeded, At this stege, it thould aleo be possibly
