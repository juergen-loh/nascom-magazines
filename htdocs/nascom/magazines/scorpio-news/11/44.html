compatible drives the TEAC drives were rather noisy in operation, compared
with the other 96 TPI drives. They are even noisier when used with either of
Gemini&rsquo;s FDCs. [Ed &ndash; this is probably so with the early Gemini CMB09 FDC
board, but with the GHa29 and GM849 boards the drives may be stepped at their
mazimim rate (3mS) (With the VFC and GM809 only Gu 1 possible, which resulta
fnithe nolse.) The GHe29 and CHES give virtually stent operation with Teacs.

&lsquo;CONCLUSIONS
</p>
<p>
As far as most software is concerned, the use of the VEC poses no problems In
</p>
<p>
Y view, the VEC represents &raquo; good, reasonably Low-cost attempt to bring the
-nloubted advantages of disk operation to Nascom&nbsp;2 owners; for someone starting
Gp with CP/M, the purchase of s Gemini CMO13 or MAP CPU card and the VFC
Fepresents &laquo; considerable cost saving on the minimum &lsquo;all Gemini&rdquo; system where 3
Boards are required Some useful features available with Gemini&lsquo;s current video
and floppy disk controllers are not found on the VFC but both che extent of
One&rsquo;s purse and the type of application may well be the deciding factors,
</p>
<p>
The ceady-bullt full version costs &pound;214 + VAT: other versions are about half
thie price In kit form, the full vereion is &pound;175 + VAT and would take a couple
of evenings to build; the video-only and floppy-only versions cost &pound;99 + VAT.
