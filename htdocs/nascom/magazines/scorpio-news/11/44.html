compatible drives. The TEAC drives were rather noisy in operation, compared
with the other 96 TPI drives. They are even noisier when used with either of
Gemini&rsquo;s FDCs. [Ed &ndash; this is probably so with the early Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM809"); ?> FDC board, but with the
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?> and
<?php externalLink("GM849"); ?> boards the drives may be stepped at their
maximum rate (3mS). (With the VFC and
<?php externalLink("GM809"); ?> only 6mS is possible, which results
in the noise.) The GM829 and GM849 give virtually silent operation with Teacs.
You must either have the software set up incorrectly, or not have the correct
software (Gemini BIOS 3.2 or later).]
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, some software in not completely compatible with the VFC &ndash; which
is a nuisance; when I tried to use an
<?php externalLink("IVC"); ?> version of DISKPEN, I found this out
the hard way and had to resort to WordStar &ndash; which is (initially) a lot less
easy to use. A Sargon chess program with rather nice graphics which worked on
the IVC (with a nasty frame wobble) failed to display any graphics at all on the
VFC &ndash; all one had was a record of the moves!
</p>
<p>
A version of DISKPEN is available now (not surprisingly called MAP PEN) which
gets over one of my problems and some software hacking might possibly overcome
the other problem &ndash; but it probably has something to do with the switching of
the IVC into its 48 character Nascom-lookalike mode which the VFC cannot do. I
suspect that the Gemini
<?php externalLink("SVC"); ?>
would also not like my version of Sargon either
since it now has a 40 by 25 display option. I don&rsquo;t play chess very often and
when I do, the machine beats me so the modifications needed are right at the
bottom of my list of priorities. Like most of the 99% of video controller users
mentioned by
<a href="../../../../80-bus-news/31/21/text/#article2">Dave Hunt in his article</a>,
I probably don&rsquo;t use the undoubted
potential of either the VFC or the SVC to their full advantantage since most of my
work is concerned with number-crunching and word-processing, rather than
graphics. The instructions given are probably as comprehensible as those
supplied with the IVC and SVC, thus implementation would pose no problem for the
addict.
<h3>
CONCLUSIONS
</h3>
<p>
As far as most software is concerned, the use of the VFC poses no problems. In
my view, the VFC represents a good, reasonably low-cost attempt to bring the
undoubted advantages of disk operation to Nascom&nbsp;2 owners; for someone starting
up with CP/M, the purchase of s Gemini
<?php externalLink("GM813"); ?>
or MAP CPU card and the VFC
represents a considerable cost saving on the minimum &lsquo;all Gemini&rsquo; system where 3
boards are required. Some useful features available with Gemini&rsquo;s current video
and floppy disk controllers are not found on the VFC but both the extent of
one&rsquo;s purse and the type of application may well be the deciding factors.

<p>
The ready-built full version costs &pound;214 + VAT; other versions are about half
this price. In kit form, the full version is &pound;175 + VAT and would take a couple
of evenings to build; the video-only and floppy-only versions cost &pound;99 + VAT.
MAP 80 Systems are now in Egham (____ _____).

Incidentally, if you are contemplating purchasing disk drives, it is possible to
buy TEAC or Mitsubishi drives which are advertised for the BBC Micro by a number
of firms. You need the double sided 80 track versions with 400k (BBC mode)
capacity which will give a formatted capacity of 784k on an 80-BUS system.
Several suppliers offer good bargains &ndash; borrow a Beeb-orientated magazine and
check the ads.
