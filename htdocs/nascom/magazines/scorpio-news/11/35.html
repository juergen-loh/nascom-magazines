Tim sorry, Hr. Martin, but it&rsquo;s about here that our opinions start to
Gifter " Todon&rsquo;t know your profession, but T would guess it&rsquo;s not involved with
either electronic manufacture or retalling

Agreed, the Nascom wes unique, being in advance of {te time and aimed at a
cotally (in thie country) untried market. Ite virtues were timplicity (relative
term) and the fact it was supplied as a kit. Sut was not {te success due to
more to its uniqueness in the marketplace rather than the fact that it was
Communicable and supplied as a kit? In the beginning there was Waecon and no
Other choice except either a much simpler machine (che original the Cambridge
117 (you know, the thing before the 2X80)) (Ed. MK1411] or the machines being
published as Serials in the clectronics mage at the time which were almost
</p>

<p>
was brought about by the need to amortize the
original development cost and not the Cost of the chips employed at the time
The fail in chip prices was reflected by a price reduction In the Nascom&nbsp;1 a
year or so after its introduction Also I can think of no exemples of board
Ranufaccurees &lsquo;hiking up&rsquo; prices in Line with the Mascon All manufacturers are
faced with the same problem, the need to recoup the cost of a decign The
material cost of the Finished produce weuslly has Little relation to the final
Selling price Most other computers started life priced fairly highly and
peices fell es the costs were recouped (ignoring the dumping of produce which
Gid&rsquo;not sett at all)

Next, Sir, you imply the lack of progressive design and by 20 doing
conteadict one of the main virtues of the Nescom. One of the gain reasons that
the Nascom was so adaptable and of auch value in (self) education was the very
fact that design was NOT stuffed into a ULA, Apart from the fact that ULAs vere
only just becoming available at the time the Nascom&nbsp;1 was designed. ULAs are
farvelous things from mass. production point of view. But you can hardly get
Inside one with a soldering iron and bend che original designers&rsquo; ideas towards
your own. Secondly, ULAG are extremely costly to develop and to gain benefit
From their use, a market must exist&rsquo; in hundreds of ehousands or even millions,
The Wascom sold in thousands, bat sever enough to make the ube of ULAE viable
</p>
<p>
Gemini have compromised &raquo; bit, they tend towards specialized PROMe and PALE
in their designs This saves a lov of chippery and by so doing simplifies board
Teyout Again Gemini boards sell in quancity, but not engugh to make ULAS
viable. Alto, &lsquo;Gemini I think must know that they ace a specialized market, and
even the sneroduction of POMS places restraints upon the flexibility of the
boards. I wonder if you have looked inside an Ametead PCwS25G, it&rsquo;s only got
half a dozen chips init (excluding eight RAMs) ail centered around one postage
Syanp sized&rdquo; 99 legged beaut in the centre, Marvelous fron + manufactucing point
of view, at even keeps the accountants happy But you&rsquo;ve gor to aim at making
Zo0d,o08 of the machines to make it viable, and heaven help anyone who wants 2
personalize an Amstrad!

And so to extended addressing there is @ craze at the monent to endov the
Z80 and the 6502 vath 126K, 256K, 512K or even a 1M of addressing capability
But what can you do with {ti No application software for micros is ever writen
that big, and ao individual ina Nascom/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Gemini context is ever going to write
anything bigger than 60K because the market is too small and even emaller for
the few Geminis fitted vith 256K RAM cards actually used as RAM It&rsquo;s the
humbers gamel&rdquo; {ve got something digger than you &ndash; never mind what you do with
itt The only sensible ching to do with this amount of RAM Is tO use Ita
virtual disk,&rdquo; Gemini have done both with the GM813 with its extended addressing
and their 256K RAM card and the 512K silicon dick. But I often wonder if it wat
Worth the effort. Don&rsquo;t forget, to use this RAM, you must have application
Software to run in it and loading 128K from tape wil take all day, and disk
oftware hes to be applicable to machines which don&rsquo;t necessarily have this
sSdress range, so what&rsquo;s the point? Ok my machine has a Si2k vireual disk but T
hardly ever use it, and someching Like the Amstrad only uses it as virtual disk
Because it&rsquo;s only got one drive and ie was cheaper than fitting &laquo; second.
