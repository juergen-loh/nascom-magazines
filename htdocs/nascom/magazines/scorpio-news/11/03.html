Editorial
</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the first issue of Scorpio News. We have agreed vith Gemini that for
Surrent G0-2US News subscribers, this neusletter represents the final istue of
their subsceiptions We hope that you Like it and that you will now subscribe
to the reat of the 1987 ieeues of Scorpio News
</p>
<p>
You will find that this first isaue has considerable similarity to previous 80-
BUS News {ssues. This 1 mainly due to the waterial, much of which was already
in hand and was thus inherited along with the 80-BUS subscriptions We hope
that future Sseues of Scorpio News will atart to take a slightly different form
</p>
<p>
For sdministrative simplicity we have decided that subscriptions will always run
to the end of a calendar year. This way all subsceiptions fall due in December,
Fegardless of when they stare, considerably of Issuing eenewal
forms Obviously the rate for will be reduced
compared vo that for the full
</p>
<p>
We apologize for the somewhat higher subscription rate of Scorpio News compared
to #0-BUS News This ts in fact to your benefit! 0-BUS News and its
predecessors {INMC and INMC-80) vere alvays directly supported by a manufacturer
br dealer, varyingly Nascom, Interface Components and Gemini. Scorpio Neus it
Completely independent. There are three main effects of this
</p>
<p>
One {6 that Editorial independence is, for the Firat time, totally guaranteed
and the material in the newsletter will be unbiased tovards any specific dealer
of manufacturer &ndash; as in fact you should start to see in this 1stue
</p>
<p>
The next effect is that time that should de being put into production of the
newsletter will not be deflected into ocher efforts of the company providing the
Financial subsidies
