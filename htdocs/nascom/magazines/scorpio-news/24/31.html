So I hope this little paper, with it&rsquo;s concentration on the way things work, has helped
to remove some of the mystique from the subject. A subject which at the moment

have removed all the mines &ndash; life&rsquo;s too short. But if I&rsquo;ve made a safe path through,
I&rsquo;ve achieved something.
