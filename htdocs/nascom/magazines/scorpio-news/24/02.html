Editorial
</h1>
<p>
Yes, we are a little late with this issue. There are a variety of reasons/excuses for
this, but I won&rsquo;t bore you with the gruesome details. The main thing that I have to
say is that all good things have to come to an end! I am of course referring to this
illustrious publication. We&rsquo;ve been going for two years now and two years on, the
Nasbus/80-BUS market has unfortunately slid further and further into obscurity.
For the number of people that we feel are likely to resubscribe for 1989, we cannot
possibly justify the continuation of the mag. Material is as scarce as rocking horse
manure too; since the last issue all we have received is one article and one letter.
</p>
<p>
However, I feel that it would be quite unfair to just come to a halt without any prior
warning, as there are quite a number of you &ldquo;out there&rdquo; who are still exceedingly
interested in 80-BUS. Therefore we will produce one last publication, in April/May
89. If you wish to receive this please send &pound;5, and if you ALSO have a message that
you wish to have included (i.e. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m particularly interested in&nbsp;...., please contact&nbsp;....
if you are too.&rdquo;), or perhaps just your address, then please let us have this
information with your cheque/postal order. We will also, as usual, be accepting ads
&mdash; rates on application. Money/letters/ads/etc in by February 28th please. Bye. &copy;
