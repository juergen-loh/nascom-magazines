at 8MHz. A Z80A CTC on a home brew board operates perfectly when the system
clock is set to 4MHz. It seems very likely that Z80B peripherals will have sufficient
margin to operate successfully at 8MHz. All the NE898 facilities tried to date have
worked well. These are the CTC and PIO on board the SPCT, and the real time
clock. The PIO is fully software and plug compatible with that on the
<?php externalLink("GM811"); ?>
and
<?php externalLink("GM813"); ?>
processors. Swapping from the Nascom only required a change of port
addresses in the BIOS to allow the printer to operate. I have run the system with
Gemini BIOSs V1, V2 and V3, and no problems have been experienced.

It is worth pointing out that in order to obtain standard RS232 baud rates a separate
crystal clook is employed, and speed selection is by dip switch. All serial clocks are
driven at the same frequency, producing the same baud rate except that each
channel can be software set to /16 or /64. This is rather limiting if the serial interfaces
are used for differing purposes. A split 1200/75&nbsp;baud rate is just not possible.

A for way DIL switch is provided with the intention of providing boot options,
although it would be possible to use these for other purposes. However, these
switches are connected via the four most significant PIO lines on port A. If these
lines are used the the switches should be left open, and the state of any external
device connected to these lines is liable to alter the cold boot action. One option
allowed by the Newburn Monitor is to boot the system from a serial port &ndash; this would
permit the operation of a diskless configuration.

Performance

<p>
The Z180 gains in raw processing power over the original Z80 in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Doubling the clock speed doubles the throughput</li>
<li>Most instructions complete in fewer clock cycles giving up to 25% increase
	(Even the the NOP completes in three cycles instead of four &ndash; this must be of some
	use!) &ndash; however the Z80 used these extra clock cycles to perform memory
	refresh. The Z180 requires to insert additional refresh cycles, although on a less
	frequent basis.</li>
<li>The new instructions, in particular the MLT instruction, can be used to good
	effect in new software</li>
<li>Use of the other facilities in particular MMU and DMA can offer very
	worthwhile benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some impression of the performance gains with pure Z80 code can be gauged from
benchmark results, although these are often criticised for not bearing much
relationship to real life processing requirements. I have run some of the tests listed
in Paddy Coker&rsquo;s articles in Scorpio News <a href="../text/#article1"></a>Issue&nbsp;1, Volumes&nbsp;1 &amp; 2. The results are
