The C I/O system starts with a set of character level functions: getc(chan),
putc(chan,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>char), getchar() and putchar(char). The last two use the default streams.
Unlike CP/M, UNIX uses <span class="uppercase">Newline</span> (ASCII 10) to separate lines rather than
CR,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>LF (13,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>10). Also unlike CP/M, UNIX knows the exact length of all files, so end
of file is reported by a value of &minus;1 (which is why getc() and getchar() return an
integer rather than a character). Because of these differences, files must be declared
as either text or binary type. This is not a problem since UNIX versions of C must
be able to cope with standard terminal devices so the facility is available.
</p>
<p>
Built on the basic I/O above are string I/O functions: puts(str), gets(str),
fputs(str,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>chan) and fgets(str,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>len,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>chan), and also word I/O getw(chan) and
putw(word,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>chan) and block I/O which accounts for a number of similar functions
which I don&rsquo;t have room to go into here. The behaviour of the string I/O is slightly
different with the file functions. Specifically, puts() adds a newline, fputs() does
not. Also fgets() has a length limit and leaves the newline in, whereas gets()
overwrites the newline with the NULL.
</p>
<p>
The most useful functions for high level I/O are printf() and scanf(). There are also
file based equivalents fprintf() and fscanf(), and string based versions sprintf()
and sscanf(). These both take a variable number of arguments (they are variadic),
the first of which is a control string (with the string and file versions the control string
comes second after the file-pointer or string-pointer). The control string declares
how the output/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>input should look. For example:
</p>
<p class="indent">
printf ( "File %s, %d records in %dK\n", filename, record_count, size );
</p>
<p>
Which would give, for a file FRED with 25 records in 4K, the output
</p>
<p class="indent">
File FRED, 25 records in 4K &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;newline&gt;
</p>
<p>
The item declarators following % symbols can specify minimum and maximum field
widths, left or right justify, and in the case of numeric values the leading zeros can
optionally be displayed. This is best shown by a table:
</p>
<table class="center" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td>Control string</td><td>Values</td><td>Result</td></tr>
<tr><td>"%c'&nbsp;&ndash; %d &lt;%x&gt;"</td><td>48,48,48</td><td>'0'&nbsp;&ndash; 48 &lt;30&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td>"*%&minus;15s %02d*"</td><td>"Total",5</td><td>*Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 05*</td></tr>
<tr><td>"%3d %3d %c"</td><td>12,6,83</td><td>12 &nbsp; 6 S</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The scanf() function attempts to match the input to the control and assigns values
accordingly. For example, if you expect an input like &ldquo;15 : x (4,5)&rdquo;, you might use a
control such as " %d : %c ( %d, %d )". The spaces in the control will match any
space (or no space) on the input.
