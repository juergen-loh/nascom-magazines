char scrn_val ( x,y )<br>
int x, y;<br>

/* Code for the function in here */<br>
}
</p>
<p>
Local variables are defined within the function body along with the code, which
consists of a list of statements. There are basically four types of statement, which
are:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="indent2">
an expression to evaluate<br>
a pre-defined construct (e.g. while)<br>
a compound statement<br>
the null statement
</p>
<p>
An interesting note here is that there is no assignment statement, and technically
speaking an expression is only evaluated (and thrown away) and not assigned.
However, assignment can be carried out as an operator forming part of the
evaluation. This allows some very interesting code such as:
</p>
<p class="indent">
sum = a-- + ( b = x / y ) + ( c = 2 * d );
</p>
<p>
(This results in b being set to x/y, c being set to 2*d, sum being set to a+b+c (after
the previous assignments) and a being decremented.) Note that expressions must
be followed by a semi-colon to form a statement. A semi-colon alone is the null
statement. Compound statements can be made by enclosing any list of statements
within braces (&ldquo;{&rdquo; and &ldquo;}&rdquo;).
</p>
<h2>
Constructs
</h2>
<p>
There are five defined constructs available&nbsp;:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="indent2">
if ( expression ) statement else statement<br>
while ( expression ) statement<br>
do statement while ( expression );<br>
for ( expression_OPT; expression_OPT; expression_OPT ) statement<br>
switch ( expression ) statement
</p>
<p>
The else section of an if construct is optional. All three expressions in a for statement
are optional, but the semicolons are not and neither are any of the parentheses
shown above.
</p>
<p>
Within the &ldquo;statement&rdquo; part of some of the above there are some other items
allowed. These are&nbsp;:&ndash;
