<h2>
Leaving The Program
</h2>
<p>
Since a C program is run by effectively calling the main() function: any exit from
this function will cause a return to system. This will occur when the code for main()
runs out, or if a return statement occurs in main(). There is also usually a function
supplied called exit(). This takes one argument which is usually O a normal exit
or non-zero for an error exit.

Conclusions

<p>
I have obviously not had space to attempt to teach anyone to use C in this article
and that was never my intention. For those of you who have not yet tried out C, I
hope this little taster has whet your appetite. There are a good number of C
compilers around at a range of prices, Probably the cheapest is HiSoft C++ (a
misleading title as C++ is a slightly different language. HiSoft is standard-C).
HiSoft does not support floating point and it compiles directly to a .COM file
without using a linker (which I find a disadvantage although some people prefer it),
but it comes with a good editor and is a good version to start on as it is pretty much
correct and standard. There are also a number of good books on the subject, but
look for recommendations as there are some bad ones too. The ultimate definitive
book is &ldquo;The C Programming Language&rdquo; by Kernighan and  Ritchie, but this is
probably a bit heavy for beginners.

Picking up the PCs

A couple of years ago, I was reading one of the more erudite electronic magazines
(Elektor) and came across a series of articles on the construction of a PC compatible
&ndash; this was sometime before Mr Sugar let loose his PC&nbsp;1512s on the scene. I found
that a motherboard (PCB) was available for about &pound;75, and a scrounge around
produced most of the chips needed to populate it. I was even able to get hold of a
PC keyboard and other requisite hardware at a very good price &ndash; the whole lot cost
rather less than &pound;250. Naturally, there were conflicts in the constructional and setting
up details and even Elektor got one or two things wrong. Sadly, the machine didn&rsquo;t
work and it was consigned to the &ldquo;pending&rdquo; area of my workshop until I had the
time to do something about it! I carried on computing with CR/M Plus and the trusty
Map-80 system.

Then, the Amstrad PCs started the rot. After some piggy-bank rattling, my wife and
I decided to buy one of these, add 128k of memory and upgrade it with a V30 and
