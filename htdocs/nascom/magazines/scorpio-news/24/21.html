N &ndash; Select attached printer to Normal print.<br>
V &ndash; Select attached printer to Condensed print.<br>
I &ndash; Initialise Printer.<br>
A &ndash; Set paging to 64 (A4) and skip to 6<br>

</p>
<p>
Any other key returns a space character to the current program. Most of the above
are self explanatory, but a few comments are in order.
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;TP command will cause the printer to advance to the top of the next page,
and reset the BIOS internal counters so that the printer can always be controlled
from the keyboard. (The only time that-problems arise is when lines longer than the
current maximum printer line are sent to the printer. The BIOS will count 1 line
when it sees a CRLF sequence, even if this is after&lsquo;200 characters, but the printer
will put in its own every &lsquo;80/132/233 or whatever, so that misalignment can
occasionally occur.) I intend to add a Character per line feature to my BIOS, and
make this alterable to 80/132/233 by means of another ^T command. This would
solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;TO will set the BIOS skip count to 0 lines, so that rolls of paper or non standard
operations can be controlled. To restore the skip, use &ldquo;TA, &ldquo;TJ, or &ldquo;TK as
appropriate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo; TF will save the contents of the screen to a disk file called S.CPY. This is a &lsquo;quick
and dirty&rsquo; routine that will only work from the operating system. It works by putting
the command SAVE 8 SE&para;.CPY into the (ZCPR3) command buffer, copying the
screen to RAM at 100H, and then rebooting. I-have not tried it with standard CP/M
by putting the command into the CPM command buffer, but it works well with
ZCPR3.
