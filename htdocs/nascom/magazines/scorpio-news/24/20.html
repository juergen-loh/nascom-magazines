In Issue 1 of Volume 1 of Scorpio News, I described some BIOS modifications to
provide immediate acting commands from the keyboard. Ihave updated and refined
this software. In particular I have added a routine to allow the saving of Screen
display to a Disk File (From the Operating System only), and altered the Screen
-Dump facility to allow it to be accessed from within any program. Previously it could
only be accessed from &lsquo;EDIT&rsquo; mode, which meant it would not work from within
some programs that redefined the &lsquo;EDIT&rsquo; key. Several more commands have been
added, and the BIOS code has been altered to save memory, allowing more routines
to be added.
</p>
<p>
My BIOS is ahome-tade modification of MAP80 CP/M 2.2 BIOS with some SYS18
routines patched in. It supports a wide combination of hardware e.g.; NASCOM&nbsp;2
or GM813:CPU, MAP4 or MAP32 paging, MAPRAM, GM833/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>NE889 Ramdisk,
809/829 FDC, 812/832.EVC/SVC, Nascom and/or Gemini Keyboards,
Micropolis/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Teac Floppies; Rodime and Shugart Winnies. &lsquo;Fhe only thing i it: does not
currently support is the Nascom Screen or the GM849 FDC.
</p>
<p>
It should not be too difficult to patch the necessary code! into any BIOS that is similar
to SYS18 or MAP BIOS, I do not use CPM 3 much, since I think that the ZCPR3
system is far superior, but it would prebably be possible to:patch something similar
into the&lsquo; MAP CPM3, for which the code is supplied. If you are using a recent
GEMINI BIOS, then yeu have had it&nbsp;! (Unless you care to disassemble it).
</p>
<p>
The code to be patched into the BIOS. can be supplied on a disk if: &lsquo;anyone is
interasted. Contact.me on the &lsquo;phone number given.

In the original article I &lsquo;described seven commands. The current version: has 15
commands. They are accessed, as before, by entering -T. This causes a prompt to
be displayed on the top line of the screen, with the required operative key displayed
in inverted video, as a reminder of the commands available. The second key may be
a &lsquo;straight&rsquo; key or Control key. The options available are limited mainly by the BIOS
space available, and could be considerably extended if a longer BIOS is acceptable,
or if some hardware options are not supported, such as RAMDISK or Winchester.
