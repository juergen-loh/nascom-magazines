In <a href="../text/"></a>Issue&nbsp;1 of Volume&nbsp;1 of Scorpio News, I described some BIOS modifications to
provide immediate acting commands from the keyboard. I have updated and refined
this software. In particular I have added a routine to allow the saving of Screen
display to a Disk File (From the Operating System only), and altered the Screen
Dump facility to allow it to be accessed from within any program. Previously it could
only be accessed from &lsquo;EDIT&rsquo; mode, which meant it would not work from within
some programs that redefined the &lsquo;EDIT&rsquo; key. Several more commands have been
added, and the BIOS code has been altered to save memory, allowing more routines
to be added.
</p>
<p>
My BIOS is a home-made modification of MAP80 CP/M&nbsp;2.2 BIOS with some SYS18
routines patched in. It supports a wide combination of hardware e.g.; NASCOM&nbsp;2
or
<?php externalLink("GM813"); ?>
CPU, MAP4 or MAP32 paging, MAPRAM,
<?php externalLink("GM833","",""); ?>/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>NE889 Ramdisk,
<?php externalLink("GM809","809"); ?>
/<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
FDC,
<?php externalLink("GM812","812",""); ?>/<?php externalLink("GM832","832"); ?>
<?php externalLink("IVC","",""); ?>/<?php externalLink("SVC","",""); ?>,
Nascom and/or Gemini Keyboards,
Micropolis/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Teac Floppies; Rodime and Shugart Winnies. The only thing it does not
currently support is the Nascom Screen or the
<?php externalLink("GM849"); ?> FDC.
</p>
<p>
It should not be too difficult to patch the necessary code into any BIOS that is similar
to SYS18 or MAP BIOS, I do not use CPM&nbsp;3 much, since I think that the ZCPR3
system is far superior, but it would probably be possible to patch something similar
into the MAP CPM3, for which the code is supplied. If you are using a recent
GEMINI BIOS, then you have had it&nbsp;! (Unless you care to disassemble it).
</p>
<p>
The code to be patched into the BIOS. can be supplied on a disk if anyone is
interested. Contact me on the &rsquo;phone number given.

In the original article I described seven commands. The current version has 15
commands. They are accessed, as before, by entering ^T. This causes a prompt to
be displayed on the top line of the screen, with the required operative key displayed
in inverted video, as a reminder of the commands available. The second key may be
a &lsquo;straight&rsquo; key or Control key. The options available are limited mainly by the BIOS
space available, and could be considerably extended if a longer BIOS is acceptable,
or if some hardware options are not supported, such as RAMDISK or Winchester.
