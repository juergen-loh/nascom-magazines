tell there are a number of different pages, they are coloured differently. This leads
to the most appalling Technicolour splodge on the screen&nbsp;&ndash; confusing, messy and
not in the least helpful. Isn&rsquo;t it simpler to use a larger area of screen&nbsp;&ndash; like all of it
&ndash; for instructions and menus, and when done with them make them go away&nbsp;? My
preference is to use the whole screen for menus, offering all the choices at once with
separate help screens (also full screen size) which come and go on request. It&rsquo;s not
first impressions which count. Windows (as pop-ups are called) might look very
clever to the prospective buyer, but pity the person who has to use them with no
other choice. After a day or so, they know the commands and what the help says.
How they wish they could turn it all off.

<p>
Pop-up and pull-down menus are good in their place, like the mice, with graphics,
but aren&rsquo;t clever when it comes to anything which is predominately keyboard
oriented. When someone is really familiar with something, menus and help screens
aren&rsquo;t required at all. So the step beyond my idea of full page menus is to make
command keys work direct. You simply bash a key and the software goes ahead and
does what is asked. Mind you, in keeping with the KISS idea of doing things, this
last approach has to be pretty clever in its own right. The user might bash keys and
the software reacts, but what if the wrong keys are hit&nbsp;? This is a process known as
&lsquo;input validation&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s what KISS is all about. Keep the software simple to use,
but make the software check everything before it does it. This isn&rsquo;t so easy as it
sounds, because the software writer has to anticipate everything which could go
wrong. I reckon a full 30% of the software I&rsquo;ve written using these ideas is down to
input validation.

<p>
Input validation must always be polite and to the point, in fact all responses from
the computer must be polite and to the point. Users don&rsquo;t like being insulted by a
dumb machine, they don&rsquo;t like their mistakes pointed out to them at any time, and
least of all by a smart-arse computer. The error messages I see on a lot of software
make me wince. These are terse in the extreme, and although not exactly rude, are
not exactly helpful either. May be you&rsquo;ve seen the sort of thing I mean:
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;INPUT ERROR IN FIND.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
much nicer and more helpful to say
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have entered the find command incorrectly, please correct and retry.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
A lot more words, but words costs nothing and at least it&rsquo;s helpful, it tells you what
you&rsquo;ve done wrong and what to do about it. A few error messages like the first, and
those who have little experience soon build up a resentment of the computer and
will then use them reluctantly from then on. Some while ago, I got fed-up with
writing polite software and wrote a cataloguing program where all the error
messages were abusive to put it mildly and where it wasn&rsquo;t abusive, it was wildly
