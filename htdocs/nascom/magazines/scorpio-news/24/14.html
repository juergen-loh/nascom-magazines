<?php columnStart(1); ?>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>struct obj</td><td>{ int x;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>int y;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>char obj_type;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>short rotation; };</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
In this case a structure type called obj refers to a pair of integers x,y (the
co-ordinates), a character obj_type (the type of object) and a short integer rotation
(the direction of the object). Now we can define variables of type &ldquo;struct obj&rdquo;, or
pointers to such a structure etc.
</p>
<p>
Unions are similar to structures except that all items are at the same place and thus
only one item is valid at a time. The main use of unions is for shared allocation of
data to reduce overall memory usage.
</p>
<p>
Aerays of any type are allowed using square brackets (&ldquo;[&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;]&rdquo;) around the index.
Multi-dimension arrays use multiple brackets. For example:
</p>
<table class="indent" style="width: 80%">
<tr><td>char</td><td>array_of_chars[16];</td></tr>
<tr><td>int</td><td>two_dimensional_array[10][10];</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The name of an array so defined translates as simply a constant of type
pointer_to_element_type, so array_of_chars above is a constant character pointer
(written as &ldquo;char * array_of_chars&rdquo;) whose value is the address of the start of the
array. This fact is not important for the use of arrays, but it does mean that a variable
of a pointer type can be used to Point to the base of an array, for example:
</p>
<p class="indent">
char * string: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /* define variable string as a character pointer */<br>
if ( string[4] == 'h' ) do_something(); &nbsp; &nbsp; /* test the fifth character */
</p>
<p>
There is no string type in C. A String is stored in an array of chars, usually terminated
by a NULL. Constant strings can be entered, e.g.
</p>
<p class="indent">
printf ( "Hello World" );
</p>
<p>
However, the string here evaluates to a constant of type &ldquo;pointer to char&rdquo; which is
the address of an area of memory containing the twelve bytes (including a
terminating NULL). Consequently a statement such as
</p>
<p class="indent">
if ( input_string == "YES" ) ....
</p>
<p>
makes no sense at all in C. The way round this is to use one of the standard functions
supplied in the library.
