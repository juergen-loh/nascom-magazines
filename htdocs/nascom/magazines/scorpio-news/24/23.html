The listing contains a number of conditionals such as &lsquo;IF SSAVE&rsquo; and &lsquo;IF CLOCK&rsquo;,
and a number of definitions such as &lsquo;PCTRLB&rsquo; and &lsquo;NMRREG&rsquo;. These are defined
in the EQUATES section of my BIOS. The purpose of each should be fairly obvious,
but I would be pleased to help anyone trying to implement these routines who is in
difficulty.

<h2>
More GEMPEN Modifications.
</h2>
<p>
Since I submitted the
<a href="../../../21/22/text/#article1">article describing modifications</a>
that I have made to GEMPEN
(PEN3.COM) and which was published in
<a href="../../../21/01/text/#page">Scorpio News, Vol.&nbsp;2, Issue&nbsp;1</a>, I have
carried out some more useful alterations to GEMPEN. I call the present version
PEN4.COM. The related HELP overlay is called HLP4.OVL. The extra features
of PEN4.COM over those added to PEN3.COM and described in
<a href="../../../14/01/text/#page">Vol.&nbsp;1, Issue&nbsp;4</a> are:
</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha-parenthese">
<li>
The top line of the screen now displays the current EDIT file name, and the
current Date and time, if a system clock exists.
</li>
<li>
^QH &ndash; The ^QH command updates the screen Date/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Time Display if a system
clock is supported and asks whether a Date and Time &lsquo;tag&rsquo; should be inserted
at the start of file in the format:
<p></p>
<pre>
;&gt; SAVSCRN.DOC 27/02/88 15:09 &lt;
:&gt;
</pre>
<p>
If a Clock is not supported:by the BIOS, the Date/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Time Tag must be hand-edited.
The format of the &lsquo;tag&rsquo; is such that it appears as a comment in a source
code file. The ^QH routine is &lsquo;called&rsquo; by the ^QW and ^QE routines so
that the operator is reminded to consider whether he wishes to tag the file
being saved.
</p>
</li>
<li>
^QN &ndash; Now allows four options. The prompt now displays:
<p></p>
<p>
Remove A)ll, S)tar, B)lock, N)one&nbsp;?
</p>
<p>
a) &lsquo;A&rsquo; will delete ALL &lsquo;*&rsquo; and &lsquo;\&rsquo; markers from the text.<br>
b) &lsquo;B&rsquo; will delete all &lsquo;\&rsquo; markers.<br>
c) &lsquo;S&rsquo; will delete all &lsquo;*&rsquo; markers.<br>
d) &lsquo;N&rsquo; will not delete either &lsquo;*&rsquo; or &lsquo;\&rsquo; markers.
</p>
<p>
The ^QN routine is called by the ^QW and ^QE commands so that the
operator is reminded to remove markers before a file is saved.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
