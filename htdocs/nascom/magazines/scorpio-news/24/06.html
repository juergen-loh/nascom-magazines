Documentation
</h2>
<p>
I understand that the documentation is currently undergoing revision. What is
currently being distributed gives sufficient information to operate the NE898,
detailing all the link options, switches, connectors and the I/O port allocations. Also
included are some example Pascal programs demonstrating the use of the DMA,
LCD interface and both the CPU and SPCT asynchronous serial interfaces. Those
people wishing to make use of the new facilities offered by the NE898 would do well
to equip themselves with the 64180 User Manual, the technical documentation on
the Z80 peripheral chips, and the application notes on the 58274 RTC chip.

<p>
The board is very solidly constructed, in keeping with Newburn&rsquo;s Industrial systems
market. It is quite densely packed, and all ICs are socketed. Most of the link options
are provided with plug and jumper, some are multi-way DIL socket and solder
headers. The outer edge of the board. is lined with a series of four dil plugs,
incorporating ejectors, &ndash; P-Bus, SPCT serial; parallel and CPU serial. According to
the manual the PCB is six layer &ndash; one of the internal layers appears to be a total
ground plane. A set of 20 uncommitted plated through holes are provided, ready to
accept an additional IC. This will allow a limited amount of tidy customisation.
There are a few minor &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; on the board &ndash; the reset switch is mounted at a peculiar
angle, two pull-up resistors are tacked onto the back of the board, as is one wire
link. However the overall impression is one of quality. Indeed the board can be
supplied with full certification of conformity of the parts used, for those customers
who require evidence of Quality Control.

In use
</h2>
<p>
The board arrives ready configured as a plug in replacement for a
<?php externalLink("GM813","",""); ?>,
set to
8MHz. Note that some existing boards will require a link setting to the AUX CLK
position before operating in an 8MHz system. The author&rsquo;s system was Nascom&nbsp;2
based, and so this was removed together with the
<?php externalLink("GM802"); ?>
64K RAM and
<?php externalLink("GM803"); ?>
EPROM cards. Thus the new configuration is NE898,
<?php externalLink("GM829"); ?>
FDC/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>SASI and
<?php externalLink("GM832"); ?>
<?php externalLink("SVC","",""); ?>.
