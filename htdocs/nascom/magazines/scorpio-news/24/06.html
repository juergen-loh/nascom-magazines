Documentation
</h2>
<p>
I understand that the documentation is currently undergoing revision. What is
currently -being distributed gives sufficient information to operate the NE898,
detailingall the link options, switches, connectors and the I/O port allocations. Also
included are some example Pascal programs demonstrating the use of the DMA,
eahetaieg and both the.CPU and SPCT asynchronous serial interfaces. Those
le td mike We of thie 1iew facilities offered by the NE898 would do well
tovequip-themsel wes. with the,64180 User Manual, the technical documentation on
the Z80 peripheral chips; f and tlie bplication notes on the 58274 RTC chip.

<p>
The board is very +y solidly constructed, in keeping with Newburn&rsquo;s Industrial systems
market. It is quite:densely packed, and all ICs are socketed. Most of the link options
are provided with plug and jumper, some are multi-way DIL socket and solder
headers. The outer edge of the board. is lined with a series of four dil plugs,
incorporating ejectors, --P-Bus, SPCT serial; paralletand GPU serial. According to
the manual the PCB is six layer &ndash; one of the internal layers appears tobe a total
Fea A set of 20 uncommitted} plated through&rsquo; &lsquo;holes are&rsquo; provided, ready to
&lsquo;acbepe ab additional 16&Prime; This &lsquo;will allow a limited amount of tidy customisation.
There are a fe minor &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; on the board &ndash; the reset switch is mounted&rsquo;at a peculiar
stors are&rsquo; &lsquo;tacked onto the back of the board, as is one wire
8 Over &lsquo;impression i is one of quality. Indeed the board can be
phied-with fy certification of conformity of the parts used, for those customers
5 Hequire evidence of Quality Control.

In use
</h2>
<p>
The board arrives ready configured as a plug in replacement for a GM813, set to
8MHz. Note that some existing boards will require a link setting to the AUX CLK
position before operating in an 8MHz system. The author&rsquo;s system was Nascom&nbsp;2
based, and so this was removed together with the GM802 64K RAM and GM8&amp;03
EPROM cards. Thus the new configuration is NE898, GM829 FDC/SASI and
GM832 SVC.
