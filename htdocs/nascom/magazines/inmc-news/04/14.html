In BASIC it is similar to the above
</p>
<pre>
10       REM REAL TIME INPUT FOR NAS-SYS&nbsp;1
20 DATA 25055,1080,-53,536,-20665,3370,-5664,0
30 DOKE 4100,3200: FOR I9=3200 TO 3214 STEP 2
40 READ I8: DOKE I9,I8: NEXT
</pre>
<p>
The routine is used exactly as for NASBUG.
</p>
<p>
Just one more for NAS-SYS users, you will have noticed (and
been annoyed by) the fact that you can&rsquo;t &lsquo;PRINT&rsquo; on the top line of the
screen. The is an unfortunate consequence of the cursor control of
NAS-SYS. You get round it this way:
</p>
<pre>
10 REM PLACING TITLES ON LINE 16 USING NAS-SYS&nbsp;1
20 Z$="TITLE": FOR Z=1 TO LEN(Z$)
30 POKE Z+Z1,ASC(MID$(Z$,Z,1)): NEXT
</pre>
<p>
Note that Z1 is the start address on the top line<br>
Min. value of Z1 = 3017<br>
Max. value of Z1 = Z1+LEN(Z$) &lt; 3065
</p>
<p>
So enough about the 8K BASIC for one session, it&rsquo;ll be a some
time before many of you get round to using this bumpf, and by then
you&rsquo;ll have used this newsletter for firelighters anyway. So don&rsquo;t
forget our back issues service folks.

LITTLE KNOWN FACTS THAT NO-ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT (4)

Did you you know that if the TV sync. slips when displaying your
Nascom, or that if you are lacking video drive to your monitor; that
you could hang a 470R preset pot across the cathodes of D1 and D2 (a
diode &lsquo;points&rsquo; to the cathode by the way) and, having removed R8 and
R9, feed the wiper of the pot to the modulator or monitor. Tweak for
best sync versus best contrast.

LITTLE KNOWN FACTS THAT NO-ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT (5)

<p>
Did you know that if you fit the NMI generator described in INMC News
2, and make the leads too long, then spurious NMIs can be caused. Every
time I turned the tape recorder off, so the damn thing would do
multiple NMIs in the keyboard routine. Now you can&rsquo;t restart from an
NMI in the keyboard routine!!! Sod&rsquo;s Law says that by having a multiple
NMI you&rsquo;ll have screwed up something.
