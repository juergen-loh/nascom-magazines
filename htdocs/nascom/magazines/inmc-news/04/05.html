It may not be the answer you expected, but it does work! The
whole problem was that the carry flag kept setting and when the
highest digit of the number in A is between 7 and F, the DAA
instruction treats it as a <span class="uppercase">Negative</span> result of the last operation,
and thus <span class="uppercase">Subtracts</span> a value of 60 if the Half-Carry flag is reset,
and if it is set, a value of 66 is subtracted (I hope that isn&rsquo;t
too blurred).

Another thing which seemed a bit obvious, to me at least, was the
name of program 32 in your list which even my neighbours! little
girl guessed correctly as <span class="uppercase">Chinese Chequers</span>!! <span class="uppercase">Carre</span> = &lsquo;<span class="uppercase">Square</span>&rsquo;,
<span class="uppercase">Chinoise</span> = <span class="uppercase">Chinese</span>.

I would like to say the standard of the latest newsletter was
much better than the first two and I really enjoyed reading it.
I do agree about the lack of participation of members in producing
material for the newsletter, but I think this will soon change.
One of the main reasons for the lack of &ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; must be the
fear of making a complete fool of yourself; but if I am willing
to take that risk, why can&rsquo;t they?
</p>
<p>
I would like to challenge every member of the INMC to write a
letter, article or program for the newsletter and show their
intellect, which up to now they seem to lack, if the puzzle is
anything to go by! Let&rsquo;s hear about some of the uses that Nascoms
are being put to apart from playing video-games and writing pages
of notes for tape storage. I have developed a data logging system
with mine over the last three months, and the finished system will
become a saleable product for the company that I work for as Logic
Design Engineer. If that puts you off, let me say that I have no
qualifications whatsoever, and had to leave school before taking
even my &lsquo;0&rsquo; levels! I have had my Nascom&nbsp;1 for just 9 months, and
I knew very little about computers at the time I bought it. (I am 23).
</p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s put some &lsquo;guts&rsquo; into the INMC before the other clubs start
to call us the Ghost Club or other unprintable nicknames, because
that is what we will become before very long, if the silence becomes
any more deafening than it is!! The only people prepared to do
anything for the club at the moment are the team <u>producing</u> the
newsletter and you can&rsquo;t expect them to do ALL of the work for the
club&nbsp;&ndash; that means <u>YOUR CLUB</u>. Be brave&nbsp;&ndash; <span class="uppercase">Do Something</span>!
</p>
<p>
Thankyou for being such a patient committee,
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely
