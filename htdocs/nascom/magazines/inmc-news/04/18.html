Members of the INMC may be interested by the following information
about an add-on graphics unit, which I have just purchased and
connected to my Nascom.
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis">
<li>
<u>Manufacturer</u> BITS AND P.C.&rsquo;s of _ ______ ____, Crigglestone,
Wakefield, ___ ___,
</li>
<li>
<u>Cost</u> &pound;32.75 in kit form, (Built for &pound;2.50 extra).
</li>
<li>
<u>Quality</u> The board is single sided, tinned, well made. Sockets
are provided, and are by Texas. The DIL plug used doesn&rsquo;t melt
when soldered to, which is both sensible and rare.
</li>
<li>
<u>Delivery</u> Eleven days from posting the order.
</li>
<li>
<u>Documentation</u> Building instructions are clear and concise,
but the two sample programs are a little less legible.
</li>
<li>
<u>What It Does</u> It extends the number of characters to the full
256 possible, using a <?php externalLink("2708"); ?> EPROM to store 64 extra characters,
each of which can also be displayed in reverse video,
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The characters provided are a good selection, and can be used
to fill complete blocks of screen &ndash; none of the annoying gaps
between lines produced by the standard set. Another EPROM
containing Chess piece characters is available for an extra &pound;10.
</p>
<p>
To sum up, a very useful extra, although the price does seem slightly
high.

<u class="double">LITTLE KNOWN FACTS THAT NO-ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT (8)</u>
</h2>
<p>
Did you know that tapes recorded for the Nascom Tiny Basic can be made
so that they can be transferred to the CC Soft (level B) Tiny Basic.
All you do is go into &lsquo;X&rsquo; mode in T4, then &lsquo;LIST&rsquo; (having turned the
tape recorder on). To load the program, simply replay the tape. Thats
the theory anyway, I haven&rsquo;t actually tried it, so perhaps someone can
tell me if it works. Oh, by the way, you might have to output a few
nulls between each line, as glossed over in LITTLE KNOWN FACT (6).
