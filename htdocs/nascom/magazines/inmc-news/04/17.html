<u>Soft&shy;ware Tips &ndash; Shuffling</u>
</h1>
<p>
Suppose you have a list of values which you want to arrange in
a random order, such as shuffling a deck of cards. There are
many possible ways to go about it, and some ways don&rsquo;t perform
a truly random shuffle and others take a lot of programming or
a long time to execute. Here are some examples:&ndash;

<u>Sort Method</u>
<p>
Attach a random number to each of the items to be shuffled.
Then sort the random numbers into sequence with a sort program.
Then take the original items in this order. This method works
correctly, and could be useful if you have a random number
generator, a sort program, and lots of memory to run it all
in and store the random numbers. It is impractical for our
purposes.

<u>Obvious Replacement Shuffle</u>
<p>
For each item in the list, i, where there are n items
(FOR I=1 to N) generate a random integer j in the range 1
to N and swop item i with item j. This method may seem to
work but it is incorrect. Some orders are more likely than
others. Never use this method.

<u>Correct Replacement Shuffle</u>
<p>
Here is a correct method!<br>
For each item i in the list of a items, but only up to n-1
(FOR I=1 to N-1), to as follows&nbsp;:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="exdent">
a) Generate a random integer j in the range i to n.<br>
J = I + INT (RND (1) * (N-I+1})
</p>
<p>
b) Swop value i with value j.
</p>
<p>
This method is very fast, is easy to program, works correctly,
and runs quickly. It can be easily programmed in BASIC or
in machine code.
