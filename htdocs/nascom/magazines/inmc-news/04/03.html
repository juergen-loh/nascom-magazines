<u>Treacle Ducks</u>
</h2>
<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Although I have been a keen radio constructor since a small boy
and a Radio Amateur for a few years, I took to microprocessing
like a duck to treacle, I don&rsquo;t know what I am doing half the
time. However, that is a great improvement, as when I first
received my Nascom&nbsp;1, I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing any of the
time! (Incidentally, the hardware worked first time).
</p>
<p>
I must say that I am thoroughly enjoying myself although my
garden has gone to pot and the house is falling down.
</p>
<p>
Much to my surprise and satisfaction I have managed to write
3 or 4 pretty respectable programs and when I can face the tedium
of typing them out, I&rsquo;ll send something to the club. Many thanks
for the newsletters. I have learned a great deal by taking the
programs apart and making notes in a large book. An idea I strongly
recommend to anyone who is lost in the wilderness, Compile a list
of subroutines which could be useful. Write &lsquo;em, steal &lsquo;em,
test &lsquo;em, file &lsquo;em.
</p>
<p>
When I finally emerge from this dark period, I hope to be able to
contribute something more useful to the club. Meanwhile, please
keep the newsletters coming. I lie in wait here, ready to pounce
on the next one.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I wish I could figure out the interfacing to external
equipment. For example, I would like to count incoming random
pulses against a reference external clock, thereby having a constantly
updated frequency displayed, I shall enjoy developing
the software (getting confident now!) but can anyone help with
suggestions for the interface?
</p>
<p>
Sincerely yours,
</p>
