<u>&ldquo;The program is listed in Z-80 assembly language&rdquo;</u>

<p id="article3">
The quotation comes from the advertising material for a program
called SARGON, which is a very good chess program, probably.
What they should have said was, &ldquo;listed in <u>A</u> Z-80 assembly
language&rdquo;. It is in fact in something called TDL assembly
language, and would run instantly on a Wave-Mate Jupiter III,
which is probably a plastic box we haven&rsquo;t had washed up on our
shores yet. There are some amazing mnemonics, for example ANI
or LIYD and what on earth is MOV BOARD(Y),<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>E&nbsp;? To be as fair as
possible, I should say that they do give a list of the more normal
equivalents, but the program is very long and will take me years
at my present rate of translation. Anyone got a program that
could do the job???

If the 8K Basic works best with NAS-SYS, then I would like to use
NAS-SYS, K*** B****** (the one who <u>swore</u> on page zero!) please note.
At present, I am using T2, with Darkbug in the spare ROM socket.
Darkbug? That is another story entirely, and one I propose to
tell next time.....

Did you know that NASBUG T4 and NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 are specifically designed to
ignore nulls output to the CRT routine. Therefore any program which is
designed to output nulls via SRLOUT, using the &lsquo;X&rsquo; command will not be
able to do so, as CRT is called as part of SRLOUT, before the character
is sent to the output port, and (of course) CRT throws the nulls away.
</p>
<p>
So, what to do? Well the simplest way is to write a routine which will:
</p>
<p class="indent">
1) Push AF<br>
2) Call SRLX<br>
3) Pop AF<br>
4) Jump to CRT in T4<br>
4a) or do a return if you don&rsquo;t want to print on the screen
</p>
<p>
Don&rsquo;t set any &lsquo;X&rsquo; command, but manually change $CRT to the start
address of the routine (don&rsquo;t forget this must be a double byte
change).
</p>
<p class="indent">
Using NAS-SYS, put DF 6F at 0C79 and activate the &lsquo;U&rsquo; command.
</p>
<p>
Of course this need not only apply to printers, for instance,
if you wanted to change a tape recorded for Nascom ROM Basic to run on
Nascom Tape Basic, you would have to make a &lsquo;LIST&rsquo; to tape and output
about 20 nulls between each line (to allow the text buffer time to
clear before the next line appears), and this is the only way to do it.

Did you know that Nascom and CC Soft (level B) Tiny Basics are quite
compatible. The only difference is that whereas the Nascom uses the
pound (or hash) sign to mean &lsquo;not equal to&rsquo;, the CC Soft uses the &lt;&gt;.
