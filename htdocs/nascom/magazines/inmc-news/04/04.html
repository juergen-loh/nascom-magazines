of valleys......I did it!!

<p>
Today I succeeded in getting all five &lsquo;chickens&rsquo; across the road!
I&rsquo;ve been trying since INMC No 2.

<p>
The Othello programme was, in my opinion, absolutely first class
and was far better than similar games being sold by software
houses with a high price tag. For those wishing to play &lsquo;2-player&rsquo;
Othello without the possible moves being indicated (a lot more fun
I think) then change:-
</p>
<p>
0D30 from 3D to 2E<br>
0E69 from 3D to 2E<br>
0E81 from 3D to 2E<br>
Not forgetting of course 0F19 from C2 to C3
</p>
<p>
I would dearly love to comply with your request in sending lots
and lots of programmes....but alas I am still struggling to acquire
the &lsquo;knack&rsquo;. I have most problems with that naughty monitor
changing my nicely set-up registers each time it does a monitor
routine....Oh! well, I&rsquo;ll keep trying and IF I eventually get a
programme to run...you can have it!

Can we expect four-letter words as well as good old fashioned
swearing on the front page of the next INMC News? I hope not!
It&rsquo;s such a bore.

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I am amazed, totally amazed that out of the total membership of
the INMC there is not one person who could come up with a solution
to the puzzle in the last newsletter (issue 2). I managed to get
the program working in about fifteen minutes from reading the
puzzle and then decided not to send the modification in, as I
thought it appeared so simple a problem that you would be swamped
with answers!! I came to the right conclusion, as written in the
latest newsletter (issue 3) but I got round the problem in a
different way from your line of thought. This is the program
complete with correcting instructions:-
