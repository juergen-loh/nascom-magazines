the Editor has to earn his keep).

Connect the master RESET of the UART (pin 21) to port 0, say
pin 14 of IC41. Then use this simple program to switch the UART on or
off.

Here is an extract from R. A. Brassington, of Wimbledon SW19.
Remember, we asked for moans in <a href="../text/"></a>INMC News 2, well we dealt with one
last time, here&rsquo;s another.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My moan I feel may apply to other users. This is my first
venture into micro-computers &ndash; at least in hardware terms, and I
decided to get myself a system with about 16K words. Working only from
magazine adverts, I tried to order the bits I thought I needed.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Even after the arrival of most of the bits, I still have not
had any guidance on expanding the system with Nascom products. I think
it would be very useful to supply with each kit (we presume he means
&lsquo;with each Nascom&nbsp;1/2 kit.&rsquo; Ed.) a brief description of the expansion
units and assemblies. It would save others the frustration that I have
had, to find that after ordering a Nascom memory card and buffer board,
I am still lacking a mother board. Etc.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s a good idea, putting a products list in Nascom Kits, we&rsquo;ll
pass that one on to Nascom. However your real course would be to seek
the advice of someone competent. Your local dealer is probably the best
person. From personal experience, don&rsquo;t write, phone. I bet you didn&rsquo;t
know that to answer the sort of questions that this letter raises would
take a three page letter, and dictating and getting it typed really
costs &lsquo;a bomb&rsquo;. Most likely the dealer would simply bung a leaflet in
the post and leave it at that.
