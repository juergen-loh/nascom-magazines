<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve just received
<a href="../../../03/00/text/#page">INMC News issue&nbsp;3</a>
and enjoyed every letter of
the script. I hope that it continues (through its members submitting
things).
</p>
<p>
However, I feel that your reply to Mr Griffith left out much
information, e.g. you claim that no information on the compat-ability
of the CCSOFT Level B Basic was available. RUBBISH you
just have to ask them. Here are a few items which may be of
interest to Mr Griffith and perhaps others.
</p>
<p>
Level B Basic &ndash; a 2K Tiny Basic complete with an Edit command as
in Super Tiny Basic (NAS&shy;COM). It also has PEEK, POKE, IN, OUT,
USR commands, Level B Basic can record in DUMP or WRITE format,
depending on which monitor is present &ndash; it tests it itself. Level
B Basic will also work with T1, T2, B-BUG, T4 and probably NAS-SYS??
(&nbsp;<i>It won&rsquo;t- Ed.</i>&nbsp;) It is available on cassette or on 2x<?php externalLink("2708"); ?> EPROM&rsquo;s.
</p>
<p>
There is also an 8K Basic for Nascom from XTAL Electronics, this
runs with T1, T2, B-BUG, T4 (one modification needed) and perhaps
NAS-SYS?? (&nbsp;<i>It won&rsquo;t- Ed.</i>&nbsp;) This is really only a 7&frac12;K interpreter.
Available on cassette only. It has an Edit command. It has all
the Nascom 8K commands except NULL, SCREEN, LINES, WIDTH, DEEK,
DOKE, SET, RESET or CLS, these commands are extremely useful, but
it&rsquo;s not all that bad if they&rsquo;re not available.
</p>
<p>
There are also 2 more Basic interpreters available, a 4K floating
point version of Level B Basic from CCSOFT and a 4K integer Basic
from MUSHROOM &ndash; contains most of the commands in NAS&shy;COM and XTAL
8K Basics.
</p>
<p>
There also is another version of a Z80 assembler available from
V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T Electronics, it is similar to the ZEAP.
</p>
<p>
There are some software packages which I&rsquo;ve not included viz
CCSOFTS SUPER DEBUG, OCTAL LOADER, RELOCATOR. There are probably
more which I&rsquo;ve not heard of or I&rsquo;ve forgotten about.
</p>
<p>
On the subject of Z80 software from magazines there&rsquo;s a lot about.
In <?php externalLink("Dr. Dobb's Journal", "Dr Dobbs"); ?>
there&rsquo;s a few Z80 programmes but there&rsquo;s masses of <?php externalLink("8080"); ?>
stuff including a TINY PLOT interpreter etc. Incidentally, there&rsquo;s
lots of CP/M type programmes coming up in Dr Dobbs at present.
</p>
<p>
The same can be said about your list of hardware, at present there
has been masses of Nascom compatible hardware put on the market
viz joysticks, graphics, calculator chips, music boxes, CUTS tape
interfaces etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
I myself have built a light pen (circuit from BYTE) which plugs in
to one of the available <?php externalLink("Z80 PIO", "PIO"); ?> parts. In short Mr Griffith there&rsquo;s
lots of hardware and software around and some which are easily
modified to work on the NAS&shy;COM,
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely
</p>
