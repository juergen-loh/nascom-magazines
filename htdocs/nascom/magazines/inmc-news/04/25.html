for issue one of Personal Computer World
there was no mention of it, though he did offer
the 4K RAM board, Yes, you&rsquo;ve guessed it, another &pound;40 hole in
my pocket, And unfortunately that&rsquo;s as far as I&rsquo;ve got. The
cash has run out, but not the enthusiasm&nbsp;&ndash; yet.
</p>
<p>
Would someone out there please, write a simple article on learning
to program the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> in HEX for those of us who are having difficulty
starting out and for whom the programming manual makes no
sense at all?
</p>
<p>
By now you must be asking how much does he want for his <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>?
But no, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed every minute of the paperchase in building
it and trying to expand, and I am enjoying, if struggling, my
programming, and so the saga will continue, (funds and wife
permitting).
</p>
<p>
In closing I&rsquo;ve just one final thing to say, and that&rsquo;s to Kerr
Borland. We, the <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;1</span> users DEMAND NAS-SYS&nbsp;&ndash; NOW.

Did you know that the 8K Basic can be persuaded to accept &lsquo;INPUT&rsquo;
strings with commas in them&nbsp;? Try this:
</p>
<p>
First set up the machine code input.
</p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-25-1.png"); ?>
<p class="indent">
Now go and get the string (including commas)
</p>
<pre>
100 GOSUB 200
110 PRINT A$:GOTO100
</pre>
<p class="indent">
This subroutine replaces the normal &lsquo;INPUT&rsquo; command
</p>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-25-2.png"); ?>
<p>
Two things here, firstly we have setup a machine code &lsquo;INKEY$&rsquo; command,
then using that, we continually add to A$ until a &lsquo;new line&rsquo; is found
in line 240. All keyboard characters will be accepted except &lsquo;new
line&rsquo;, and &lsquo;back space&rsquo; which are treated separately. Note that line 30
assumes that <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span> is in use, whilst line 40 resets the pointers if
NAS-SYS is present. See LITTLE KNOWN FACT (3) and the 8K Basic page for
further details.
