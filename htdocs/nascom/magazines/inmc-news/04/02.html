I thought that it was about time to put finger to keyboard, to
impart a little information, and to make a few observations.
</p>
<p>
The response to
<a href="../../../03/00/text/#page">INMC3</a>
was very encouraging and this issue covers
fresh ground in devoting a large percentage of space to items
received from INMC members. I hope that
<a href="../../15/text/#article1">Doctor Dark&rsquo;s Diary</a>
will become a regular feature and that other contributors will
come forward with series of articles to give the magazine the
continuity which assists so much in creating a feeling of
involvement amongst the readers.
</p>
<p>
Up until recently all mail addressed to &ldquo;The Editor&rdquo; has received
a reply, even if this has only been in the form of a &ldquo;plastic&rdquo;
standard acknowledgement form. As the volume of mail grows,
continuing to do this unfortunately becomes both expensive and
time consuming. In future, therefore, I would ask that if a
specific reply be required then the writer should enclose a
stamped self-addressed envelope &ndash; without this the contents of
the letter will be noted and possibly put in the next magazine,
the hardware library, or the software library but no reply will
be sent.
</p>
<p>
The software library continues to grow and I hope that we will
be able to announce the availability of a further batch of programs
in the next newsletter. The INMC committee has been considering
some way of rewarding contributors of programs and I am pleased
to announce that it has decided to issue &pound;5 vouchers that can be
used to purchase programs in the library. These vouchers will be
issued to the writer of any program that is made available in the
INMC lists, and they will also be issued to the writers of those
programs already on the list.
</p>
<p>
As you will see elsewhere in this issue, but I will still repeat
it, the address for the INMC is changing. In future all letters
should be addressed to:&ndash;
</p>
<p class="indent2">
INMC<br>
c/o Nascom Microcomputers Ltd.,<br>
__ _____ ______,<br>
CHESHAM,<br>
Bucks, ___ ___
</p>
<p>
All correspondence concerning subscriptions, membership and orders
from the library should be addressed to &ldquo;The Secretary&rdquo;; all
technical queries, contributions to the magazine and items for
the hardware or software libraries to &ldquo;The Editor&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
I trust that you will enjoy reading this issue and that you will
find all of the items interesting, informative and inspirational!
The INMC membership grows daily and I hope that shortly I will be
receiving from you your comments, programs and articles so that
the International Nascom Microcomputer Club can move further and
further forward in becoming a true users club.
</p>
<p>
Happy Reading,
</p>
<p>
<u>The Editor</u>
