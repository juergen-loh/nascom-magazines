combination of the BASIC and monitor as it was recorded. So what to do,
your mate down the road has &ldquo;Nascom ROM Basic&rdquo; and you have &ldquo;Nascom
Tape Basic&rdquo;. First, don&rsquo;t give up, all hobbies ought to have a bit of
frustration value built in otherwise you&rsquo;ll soon get bored. Go into &lsquo;X&rsquo;
mode in NASBUG T4/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>NAS-SYS (if you&rsquo;ve got T2, sorry, you can&rsquo;t do it),
then &lsquo;LIST&rsquo; with the tape recorder going. Now all your mate does is to
zap the tape in his recorder, switch on, and lo!, the BASIC thinks its
got a super fast typist on the keyboard. Thats a bit simplified &lsquo;cos
you&rsquo;ll have to output some nulls at the end of each line using
the&lsquo;NULL&rsquo; command, and there&rsquo;s some snags there. Read the &lsquo;LITTLE KNOWN
FACTS&rsquo; spread about this newsletter.

Now for a couple of tips;
</h4>
<p>
One feature missing on the 8K BASIC which is extremely useful
on the (dare I mention it)
Tandy <?php externalLink("TRS-80"); ?> Level II (which is a 12K
extended BASIC by the way), is an &lsquo;INKEY$&rsquo; command, it&rsquo;s a must for
interactive keyboard games etc. What is does is scan the keyboard once,
and if a key is down, return with its value. It doesn&rsquo;t wait for a key
press like the &lsquo;INPUT&rsquo; command. A simple bit of machine code fixes
this.

<h4>
For NASBUG T4
</h4>
<pre>
0C80  CD 63 00            CALL KBD      Scan the keyboard once.
0C83  38 04               JRC, PUTINB   If a char, go to PUTINB.
0C85  CB FF               SET 7, A      If no char, set bit 7,
0C87  18 02               JR RET        then go to RET.
0C89  47         PUTINB   LD B, A       Put the char in B,
0C8A  AF                  XOR A         then clear A.
0C8B  2A 0D E0   RET      LD HL, ABRET  Load HL with return address,
0C8E  E9                  JP (HL)       and jump to it.
</pre>
<p>
It&rsquo;s a bit inconvenient to load that by hand, so lets turn it
into BASIC and let it load itself.
</p>
<pre>

110 Z=USR(0): REM IF Z&lt;0 THEN NO KEY WAS PRESSED
120 REM           IF 2&gt;0 THEN Z = THE ASCII VALUE RETURNED

<p>
For those lucky few with NAS-SYS, things are slightly
different, and in consequence the routine is one byte shorter, thus:
</p>
<h4>
For NAS-SYS&nbsp;1
</h4>
<pre>
0C80  DF                  RST SCAL      Internal subroutine call
0C81  61                  DEFB #61      Table number for KBD
0C82  38 0F               JR C, PUTINB          etc
</pre>
<p>
Then as for the NASBUG routine
