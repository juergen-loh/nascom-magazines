Unless you haven&rsquo;t been reading these marvellous bits of prose
we have been writing over the last months, you can&rsquo;t have failed to
notice that we have mentioned NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 on occasion. NAS-SYS is of
course the new monitor for Nascom&nbsp;2. Now the Nascom&nbsp;2 is almost with us
(at the time of writing), and as Nascom have agreed (at least in
principle) to release NAS-SYS on an unsuspecting public, we thought we
ought to let you know what you are in for.
</p>
<p>
NAS-SYS is an entirely new monitor, and is not compatible with
software written to run under the earlier <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span> &lsquo;T&rsquo; series monitors.
However, NAS-SYS is compatible with Nascom&nbsp;1 hardware.
</p>
<p>
So having plugged in our brand new NAS-SYS, and not having
bothered to read the words that come with it (on the basis of &ldquo;If
everything else fails, try reading the instructions&rdquo;), what do we
find?
</p>
<p>
Well, the screen blanks as usual, but displays &ldquo;NAS-SYS&nbsp;1&rdquo; on
the top left of the screen with a cursor (which blinks on and off) at
the start of the line below. There is no &gt; sign as a prompt. The
screen &ldquo;scrolls&rdquo; from the top downwards; when the cursor reaches the
bottom line the display starts to scroll up. &ldquo;
</p>
<p>
NAS-SYS shows it&rsquo;s parentage as being &ldquo;from B-BUG out of <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span>
T4&rdquo;, as many of the commands have identical or closely similar
functions with many detail improvements; the following are identical or
similar to <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span>:
