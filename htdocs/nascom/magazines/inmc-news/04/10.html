LITTLE KNOWN FACTS THAT NO-ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT (3)
</h2>
<p>
Did you know that line number arguments can be appended to the
&lsquo;RESTORE&rsquo; command in the 8K Basic. Thus:
</p>
<pre>
20 DATA 20,29,37,196,20,53,30
30 DATA 20,21,445,44,196,37,77,60
.
etc
.
190 RESTORE 30: IF X=Y THEN RESTORE 20
etc
</pre>
<p>
Note that in the above example the &lsquo;RESTORE&rsquo; command restores to the
second tine of &lsquo;DATA&rsquo;, not the first as would be more usual. Further,
the &lsquo;RESTORE&rsquo; to the first line is made conditional upon X and Y.
Interesting ain&rsquo;t it!
