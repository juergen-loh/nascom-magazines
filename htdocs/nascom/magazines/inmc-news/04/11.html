does it again
</h1>
<p>
I recently assembled the Sargon chess program to run on my Nascom.
The response time of this program was rather long so I tried
running the system at 4Mhz and found that it worked well at this
clock rate. Tiny Basic would not run, because the EPROMs are not
fast enough, but all the other programs that I tried worked perfectly,
with the single exception of ZEAP which produced garbled
lines when assembling long programs at 4&nbsp;Mhz. I fitted a switch
in place of the clock select link on the buffer board so that I
could operate the system at either speed, and as a result made an
amazing discovery &ndash; a program that would run at 4&nbsp;Mhz but not at
2&nbsp;Mhz.
</p>
<p>
The program was suggested by the June issue of Creative Computing
which published the value of pi to 8192 decimal places; no details
were given of the method used, but I decided to try and write a
program for Nascom to give at least as many places. I assembled
the program with ZEAP and it appeared to work well, but I soon
found that from the 160th decimal place the figures were wrong.
I spent a long time over the next day or two looking for a software
bug, with no success, and I was becoming obsessed by the
problem when it suddenly started to give the correct answer. This
was even worse, because I had not changed anything. It was quite
a while before I realised that the clock rate was switched to 4&nbsp;Mhz;
returning to the standard rate caused the fault to reappear.
</p>
<p>
Further experiments showed that the result was only wrong when the
program was in static RAM on the CPU board; in dynamic RAM it ran
perfectly at either clock rate. I had just decided that there was
some unexplained fault on the CPU board when I received
<a href="../../../../inmc-news/03/12/text/#article1">issue&nbsp;3 of INMC News</a>,
which suggested that noise could cause problems on
early boards. &ldquo;Bussing up&rdquo; the ground and 5V rails improved the
operation of the pi program &ndash; it now got the answer right up to
the 450th place. As noise was apparently the cause of the problem
I finally tried &ldquo;bussing&rdquo; the memory boards. I had not carried
out this simple modification before because as far as I knew my
system was free of &ldquo;memory plague&rdquo;. This cleared up the problem
entirely and as a bonus it has reduced the sensitivity of the
system to external (mains) noise and improved the operation of
ZEAP at 4&nbsp;Mhz! Perhaps it would be worthwile modifying memory
boards even if they don&rsquo;t suffer from the plague.
</p>
<p>
Presumably if I hadn&rsquo;t tried to run the system at 4&nbsp;Mhz I would
still be looking for the software bug!
