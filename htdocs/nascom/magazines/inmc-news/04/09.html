In general terms, all the parts to fit an expanded Nascom
together are supplied in the kits, although the frame kit is a bit
short on nuts and bolts for fitting a large number of cards. Well nuts
and bolts are easily found.

<p class="noindent">
Many of you have enquired what Nascom products are available as
opposed to &ldquo;coming shortly ..... next week .... next month ....&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Some snooping behind the scenes reveals the following items to
be generally available ex-stock:&ndash;

DIP boards, <?php externalLink("2708","",""); ?>s etc. are available.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
There are several other products &ldquo;in the pipeline&rdquo; and we believe
one or two to be virtually ready. The only real way to check up
on the current.situation is to contact either Nascom themselves
or your local distributor.

<u class="double">Little Known Facts That No-One Seems To Care About (1)</u>

<p class="noindent">
Did you know that as most of the machine code dumps that appear in this
news letter were printed using the &lsquo;T&rsquo; command (having set the &lsquo;X&rsquo;!
command to drive the printer), and as the &lsquo;T&rsquo; command outputs a
checksum at the end of each line (then backspaces over it on the
screen); you could type machine code into your Nascom using the &lsquo;L&rsquo;
command. Hence the whole exercise becomes self checking. No more errors
from mistyped code. Think about that for a while!

<p class="noindent">
Did you know that to speed up the Tiny Basic you should use the &lsquo;LET&rsquo;
(or faster still, the &lsquo;L.&rsquo;) command as a prefix to declaring the
variables. Thus:
</p>
<p class="indent">
20 A=1;B=2;C=3;D=4 ...... etc, becomes<br>
20 L.A=1,B=2,C=3,D=4 ......etc
</p>
<p class="noindent">
Note that the semicolons become commas to further speed up the process.
