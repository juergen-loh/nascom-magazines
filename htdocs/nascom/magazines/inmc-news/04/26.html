<u>FOUR FREE PROGRAMS</u>!
</p>
<p>
As a special bonus, here are four
programs which are fun to have. We
hope to include proper assembly
listing of these programs in the
software library soon, so that you
will be able to see how they work.
</p>
<p>
You should find all the programs
self explanatory, given the notes
printed with them. The last column
of numbers on the listings is a
checksum, so don&rsquo;t type it in! {or
see little known Fact No. 1).
</p>
<p>
The programs will run under NASBUG
T2, B-BUG or NASBUG T4. We hope
to reassemble them for NAS-SYS one
day.
