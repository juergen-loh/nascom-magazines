<h1>
<u>INTERNATIONAL NASCOM MICROCOMPUTER CLUB</u>
</h1>
<p>
It is with great pleasure, and relief, that I write this preface
to the second newsletter. I have always wanted the INMC to be
run by hobbyists and certainly not by Nascom. My staff will, of
course, continue to do the donkey work in answering your queries
and collating and printing the newsletter.
</p>
<p>
As you will see as you get further into this newsletter, I have
persuaded various London-based hobbyists to become an INMC Committee.
We have been very fortunate in persuading David Hunt to chair this
committee. They layout their ideas later on. However, I would
immediately say that they have a totally free hand in the running
of INMC, they are entitled to publish in the INMC News any relevant
Nascom information, be it complimentary or otherwise, that they
feel is worthwhile with the exception of any detrimental comments
against a Nascom competitor.
</p>
<p>
I hope that you will really start to support them fully now and
that the INMC can become the force that it should be within hobbyist
and other computing and that its value to the Nascom user in
particular will be significant.
</p>
<p>
I wish you all every success and hope that the Club library will
now show an enormous upturn for the better,
</p>
