<u>ZEAP</u>
</h1>
<p>
Quite a few people have written to Nascom detailing &ldquo;errors&rdquo;
that they have found in Zeap. In actual fact we know of very
few incidences of faulty tapes being supplied or of any major
operational bugs &ndash; errors have usually been found to be caused
by incorrect entry of source programs, or by faulty memory
boards. Please read the Zeap manual carefully to ensure that
you are operating Zeap correctly. If you are in any doubt as
to if your memory board is functioning correctly, then contact
either your distributor or Nascom.
</p>
<p>
All of the members of the INMC committee have been running Zeap
for some time now, and many programs have been written using it &ndash;
this includes the 2K monitor, Nasbug T4. We are, therefore, in
no doubt that the Zeap package is an extremely powerful and
worthwhile Nascom product.
