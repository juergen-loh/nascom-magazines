<u>NASBUG T4</u> Extended 2K Monitor for Nascom I
</h1>
<p>
NASBUG T4 incorporates the best facilities of NASBUG T2 and
B-BUG, and has been further extended to allow keyboard access
to the PORTS, use as an intelligent terminal, keyboard shift
options, and the Z80 restarts to be of more use to the user.
</p>
<h2>
Command Table
</h2>
<p>
A Hexadecimal arithmetic to calculate the sum, difference and
relative jump of two addresses.
</p>
<p>
B Breakpoint as NASBUG T2, but also automatically relocates the
cursor to the bottom left of the screen if it has been moved
by the user, Breakpoint is set to zero on Reset.

erradication.

<p>
I Intelligent Copy will copy data up or down without corruption

C command has been left in the command table as the corruption
caused can be deliberately used to profit under certain
conditions.
