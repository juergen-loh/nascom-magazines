Tiny Basic Page

Firstly have you noticed that setting up the array to a certain value always
seems to take a long time. Well if you have the tiny basic, vou can make
use of the MCU commend to set the array by a machine code up copy. This short
subroutine (courtesy of Howard) makes full use of this facility, and even
allows setting parts of the array.
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-17-1.png"); ?>
<p>
Also when using the machine code facilities of the 3K tiny basic, some neat
tricks with the MCI and MCP commands are possible. One is to find the length
of L after an MCI input.
</p>
<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-17-2.png"); ?>
<p>
Further, when using multiple strings, the array may be used to keep track
of the addresses and lengths of the strings.

<?php imageInsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-17-3.png"); ?>
