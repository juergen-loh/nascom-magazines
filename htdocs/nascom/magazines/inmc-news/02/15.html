<p>
A code guessing game for the Nascom&nbsp;1. &nbsp; By D. Ritchie.
</p>
<p>
This programme was included in the first batch of programmes issued by
the INMC. Unfortunately, it did not copy very well, and a number of
customers were unable to read the object code listing. We are,
therefore, including a copy of the object listing in the newsletter.
The source listing will continue to be available from the INMC library
in the normal way.

<h2>
<u>Notes on the game</u>
</h2>
<p>
Codes are made up of any combination of four of the octal digits
(0&nbsp;&ndash; 7).
</p>
<p>
The score for each guess is given as 2 digits. The first is the number
of correct digits in correct position. The second is the number of
correct digits in the wrong position.
</p>
<p>
You and the machine take alternate guesses at each others code. You
first enter a guess at the machines code, &lsquo;newline&rsquo; gives your score.
Another &lsquo;newline&rsquo; gives the machines guess at your code. After
entering its score, &lsquo;newline&rsquo; lets you enter your next guess, and so
on until both codes are found. Pressing R will re-start the game at
any time. Backspace can be used to correct entries.
