therefore, sorting through the programs at the moment and
putting them into various categories &ndash; e.g. runs on unexpanded
Nascom, runs on expanded Nascom, runs under Tiny Basic, Super
Tiny Basic etc. We hope to have a list available shortly but
meanwhile you&rsquo;ll find a machine code program and some Super
Tiny Basic examples elsewhere in this newsletter.

However, it is obvious to the committee that everybody lost
interest during 1978. This, of course, includes us. We have
taken on the task of trying to re-establish the INMC on the
assumption that most users, like ourselves, would rather have
it working than not have it at all. Therefore, we need your
help, your support, your programs and your ideas and hardware
additions that we can publish in our newsletter. Now that
many people have expanded Nascoms we hope that we will start
to see significant numbers of programs of a more interesting
nature than perhaps was possible before when one had to create
the whole thing in machine code.
</p>
<p>
This first three months is critical not only from the point of
view of you starting to believe in us, but also to confirm in
our minds that the INMC is practical. The whole thing is now in
our control and having objected strongly to the way that Nascom
ran it last year, we rely on your support so that we can run it
properly,

<u class="uppercase">Competition.</u>
</h1>
<p>
We have decided to hold a competition to see what sort of nutty
games programs you are all writing. The rules are outlined
below. First prize will be either a Super Tiny Basic or a Zeap
editor/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>assembler cassette along with a selection of the programs
submitted. There will also be five runners-up prizes, each
being a selection of the programs submitted to the competition.
So send in your programs &ndash; don&rsquo;t worry what your coding is like,
we won&rsquo;t be judging that!
</p>

<li>
Programs must run in an unexpanded Nascom and must

Programs will be primarily judged on &ldquo;entertainment
value&rdquo;.
