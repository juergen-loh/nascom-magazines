<u>Chairman&rsquo;s Letter.</u>
</h1>
<p>
A few weeks ago Kerr Borland of Nascom approached us and asked
if we would be interested in forming a committee to run the
INMC; so after a most undemocratic election (each proposing the
other and voting despite the protests of the nominee), we
reluctantly agreed to become the committee until such time as a
more democratic method could be adopted. In return for Kerr&rsquo;s
</p>
<p>
generosity in suggesting we become the committee, we landed him
with the job as President.
</p>
<p>
So, having taken the job let us introduce ourselves:
</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr><td>Kerr Borland</td><td>Nascom Sales Director</td><td>President</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dave Hunt</td><td>A Nascom Distributor</td><td>Chairman</td></tr>
<tr><td>Richard Beal</td><td>Systems analyst/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>consultant</td><td>Software-co-ordinator</td></tr>
<tr><td>Howard Birkett</td><td>Film Editor</td><td>Hardware co-ordinator</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paul Greenhalgh</td><td>Nascom Engineering</td><td>General dogsbody</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
So our first job was to define the aims of the INMC, which we
set out as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
That the INMC should be self-supporting; which would allow
the INMC to be reasonably independent of the manufacturer.
</li>
<li>
To distribute hardware and software information about Nascom
as cheaply as possible, consistent with making the INMC self-supporting.
</li>
<li>
To do this by means of a software library and newsletter.
</li>
<li>
That the library and mailing address for the INMC should remain
as Nascom Microcomputors at Berkhamsted, and that Nascom would
publish and distribute the newsletter.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We would like the newsletter to contain news and information that
members might consider of interest to other members, as well as
software and hardware notes. We would also like to set up a
&lsquo;Problems Page&rsquo; to answer specific questions that might be of
interest to other members. So send in your articles, problems,
moans, praise etc, Nascom will forward them to the appropriate
members of the committee for editing and inclusion in the newsletter.
</p>
<p>
Remember, the more feedback we get from members, the more lively
(and more frequent) the newsletter will become. So to sum up,
this is your newsletter, USE IT!!!
