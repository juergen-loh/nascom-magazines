If you have a hardware fault many of the distributors are
able to offer a repair service. If your distributor does
not offer a repair service, then the unit can be returned
direct to Nascom&rsquo;s service department.

<p>
Finally, if you feel that you are not getting anywhere with
either your distributor or Nascom, then write to the Editor,
INMC, and we will see what we can do.

<u>Applications</u>

<p>
We would be interested to hear from anybody who is using,
or would like to use, their Nascom&nbsp;1 for any specialised
purpose.

<p>
<u>Amateur Radio</u> &ndash; We hear that John Wilson, G8HUN, is compiling
details of amateur radio applications and he would like to
talk to anyone interested in this field. So far he knows of
people who are investigating using their Nascom for RTTY,
transmitting and receiving morse, satellite tracking,
controlling synthesizers etc. Anyone else interested in
these or similar applications should contact John, in the
first instance c/o INMC.

<p>
Whilst on this subject, it should be noted that the 2K
monitor, Nasbug T4, contains amongst its routines one that
enables radio amateurs to transmit and receive ASCII data
with no additional software and minimal hardware modification.
