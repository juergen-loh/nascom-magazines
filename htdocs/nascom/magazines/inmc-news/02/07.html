For example, let us suppose that an interrupt routine
for Port A starts at 0E12H, and that the interrupt
address table will be stored at 0F80H. In order that
the routine should be found correctly, the I register
should contain 0FH, the value 80H should be sent to
the control register of Port A, and finally, memory
locations 0F80H and 0F81H should contain 12H and 0EH
respectively (low byte first). At an interrupt, CPU
interrupts are automatically disabled and must be
re-enabled, if required, by the programmer.
</p>
<p>
Always end an interrupt service routine with the RETI
instruction, as this is the only way to indicate to the
PIO port, that the service routine is finished. This
feature can cause some dismay to the unwary. Take the
following example: everything is set up correctly, and
the PORT interrupts correctly. However, unfortunately
the interrupt routine crashes. No problem to our intrepid
experimenter, he presses reset, debugs the interrupt
routine and tries aqain, remembering to reset IM 2, I
register and interrupt enable. Dismay! Nothing happens.
No interrupt.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that the PIO still thinks that is is being
serviced for its initial interrupt, and is internally
inhibited from causing another. A useful routine to get
out of this sort of problem is as follows:&ndash;
</p>
<pre>
21 00 00         LD        HL, 0000H
ES               PUSH      HL
ED 5E            RETI
</pre>
<p>
This will tell the PORT that its service routine
is finished and then restart the monitor by executing
from 0000H. It can be used at any time, 1f there is any
doubt as to the status of a PIO.
</p>
<p>
Once the mode and interrupt control have been set, the Port
interrupt may be enabled or disabled by sending 83H or 03H
to the control register. This feature could form the basis
of a generalized interrupt control program for a given
system. However, it should be noted, that the correct way
to disable a port interrupt, is to first of all disable CPU
interrupts before the Port interrupt. This is because an
interrupt by that Port, during the execution of the instruction
to disable its interrupt, would cause a system crash.
</p>
<p>
Finally, when a Port has been disabled, an interrupt may be
pending, so that when the Port is again enabled it will at
once interrupt the CPU. This Pending interrupt may be
cleared, if required, by sending an interrupt control word
with bit 4 set. This is effective in all modes.
