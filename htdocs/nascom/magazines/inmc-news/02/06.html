<u>Notes on PIO Operation.</u>
</h1>
<p>
The Nascom I has on board two totally uncommitted 8 bit
parallel I/O ports complete with handshake lines, in the
shape of an MK3881 Z80 &ndash; PIO. The PIO is, in itself, a
fairly complicated processor, which needs programming
before it will operate in any of its 4 modes:
</p>
<table style="width: 100%">
<tr><td>OUTPUT</td><td>MODE 0</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>INPUT</td><td>MODE 1</td><td>(automatically set on PIO Reset)</td></tr>
<tr><td>BIDIRECTIONAL</td><td>MODE 2</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>CONTROL</td><td>MODE 3</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
It is not the purpose of these notes to describe in detail
these operational modes, but to help clear up a few
common problems encountered in controlling the PIO.
</p>
<p>
One very important fact to note is that the PIO is not
reset by the RESET button on the keyboard. This resets
the CPU only, <u>NOT</u> the PIO. It may be reset in two ways.
The simplest is to switch the power off and on again; a
bit drastic but the PIO does have automatic power on reset.
The second method (shown in fig.3&nbsp;) is to apply an M1
without either <?php invertedSignal("RD"); ?> or
<?php invertedSignal("IORQ"); ?>. It should, however, be pointed
out that, since the CPU can be reset, it is always possible
to regain control of the PIO in software, by simply
reprogramming it.
</p>
<p>
Now to &lsquo;interrupts&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t forget that the PIO is designed
to operate in the Z-80 Interrupt Mode 2, so before doing
anything put the CPU into this mode by executing &lsquo;IM&nbsp;2&rsquo;
(HEX code ED 5E). Remember that a CPU reset puts the Z-80
back to Interrupt Mode 0 clears the I register, and dissables
CPU interrupts (having no effect on the PIO).
</p>
<p>
In Interrupt mode 2, the CPU finds the <u>address</u> of the
interrupt routine, by loading the Program Counter (P.C.)
with the <u>contents</u> of the memory address. This is formed
by the I register (high byte), and the interrupt vector
sent from the interrupting port (low byte).
