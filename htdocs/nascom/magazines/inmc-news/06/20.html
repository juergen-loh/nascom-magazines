You may have wondered when the READY line goes low. In both
modes the READY line goes low when an interrupt is generated. This may
be used by the external device to acknowledge that an interrupt has
been received. It could be used to inhibit further interrupts from the
external device, particularly where a number of PIO&rsquo;s are &lsquo;daisy
chained&rsquo; together, and higher priority interrupts are already being
processed, hence there will be a delay before the external device is
processed. In other words, it says to the external device &ldquo;OK, seen
you, you are in the queue, don&rsquo;t bother me again until I go high.&rdquo;. It
has no internal affect on the PIO, save to get it ready to go high
again when processing of the interrupt is complete.

<u class="double">Example of handshaking sequence</u>
</h2>
<p>
For two PIO&rsquo;s to handshake, the STROBE (input) line of each is
connected to the READY (output) line of the other. This diagram shows a
typical sequence of events, starting with a dummy read from. the input
port to start the process.

You could try this with just one PIO, by making the two ports
of your PIO talk to each other.
