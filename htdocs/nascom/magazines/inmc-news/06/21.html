A note for Nascom&nbsp;2 owners. The memory card joins the &lsquo;daisy
chain&rsquo; (IEI and IEO) lines together, and under these conditions the
interrupts won&rsquo;t work. Cut one of the tracks on the vero buss
connector. Do not cut the link on the memory board, as this would be
required if that card were used on a bigger buss with &lsquo;daisy chain&rsquo;
priority interrupts.

Repeat keyboard for Nas-sys
</h1>
<h3 class="author">
by Richard Beal
</h3>
<p>
In the last issue we printed a repeat keyboard routine for
Nasbug T4. This can be adapted to Nas-sys, but we have now developed a
routine which is simpler. This routine has given us an opportunity to
show you the output of ZEAP 2.0, notice the sorted symbol table; there
is a listing of the routine and a program to put the routine into use.
Execute the program at 0C90H.
</p>
<p>
The routine itself is from 0C80 to 0CF5H. After the program is
executed it returns to Nas-sys. You can then use Nas-sys or execute
ZEAP 2.0 or Basic and enjoy the benefits of a repeating keyboard. Just
hold down any key, and after a delay it will repeat quite quickly,
which is ideal for cursor movements. Try holding down several keys at
once!! Note that the @ key does not repeat because of its dual function
on Nascom&nbsp;1. We also attach a tabulation of the code to make it easier
to type in.
</p>
<h4>
Memory usage and changing the speed
</h4>
<p>
We hereby declare the following memory locations will for all
time have the specified meanings&nbsp;:&ndash;
</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
	<col style="width: 30%">
	<col>
</colgroup>
<tr><td>0C2C &ndash; 0C2DH</td><td>KCNT counter tor repeat keyboard</td></tr>
<tr><td>0C2E &ndash; 0C2FH</td><td>KLONG delay before repeating starts</td></tr>
<tr><td>0030 &ndash; 0C31H</td><td>KSHORT speed of repeating keys</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
These were unused locations in the Nas-sys work area. To change
the initial delay before repeating starts, and the speed of repeat,
change the values at KLONG and KSHORT.
</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
	<col style="width: 30%">
	<col style="width: 20%">
	<col>
</colgroup>
<tr><td>Suggested values:</td><td>4MHz</td><td>2MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td>KLONG</td><td>0280H</td><td>0140H</td></tr>
<tr><td>KSHORT</td><td>0050H</td><td>0028H</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The version overleaf is for 4MHz (Nascom&nbsp;2).
</p>
<h4>
Repeating keyboard from Basic
</h4>
<p>
You can also set up a repeating keyboard within Basic, by
typing in the Basic subroutine at lines 24000 to 24090. To execute it,
type in: RUN24000
</p>
<p>
You will find that you then have a repeating keyboard. Note that line
24030 sets the speeds, we suggest the following values:
</p>
<table style="width: 70%">
<tr><td></td><td>4MHz</td><td>2MHz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Initial delay</td><td>DOKE 3118,640</td><td>DOKE 3118,320</td></tr>
<tr><td>Repeat rate</td><td>DOKE 3120,80</td><td>DOKE 3120,40</td></tr>
</table>
