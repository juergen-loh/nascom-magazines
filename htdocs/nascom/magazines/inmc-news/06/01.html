Nascom Microcomputers Ltd. which has become Britain&rsquo;s
leading Micro board Company announce a re-organisation
within the Company and also, sadly, the resignation of
their Marketing Director, Kerr Borland.
</p>
<p>
The John Marshall&nbsp;&ndash; Kerr Borland team started Nascom in
January 1978. They have steered it through many birth&nbsp;&ndash;
pains to reach the dominant market position they have
now achieved. This very success has resulted in the split.
</p>
<p>
Kerr Borland has always said that his interests lay in
promoting and creating a sound market base for new products.
Once the product was successfully launched, others were
better suited to continue. For this reason he is leaving
Nascom to set up a new promotions company called Product
Launch. This company will cope with all the specialised
marketing that is needed in the short term when presenting
new products to the market place.
</p>
<p>
Nascom immediatly become his first customer and he will
continue to launch Nascoms new product range due throughout
1980.
</p>
<p>
In the wake of Kerr Borlands departure, Nascom are reorgansing
their Sales and Marketing function. Sales
Management will be taken over by another Board member,
Bill Bulman, and the company will create a new Marketing
section separate from the Sales function.
</p>
<p>
Nascom has a huge user base throughout Europe and Scandinavia
and an extensive distributor network. In two years
it has reached a market position that has encouraged many
small companies to produce peripherals for use with Nascom
equipment.
</p>
<p>
This firm base which spreads across industrial,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>educational
and home user areas makes an excellent springboard for
attacking the 1980&rsquo;s market place.
