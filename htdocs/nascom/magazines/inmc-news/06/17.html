<p>
What is the perfect memory layout for the future? What software
should be resident in ROM and what should be loaded from tape? You
might like to think about these questions in regard to some of the
software that already exists or is rumoured to be around.

	although it is not totally impossible to put it
	elsewhere with Nascom&nbsp;2.</td></tr>

	E000 &ndash; FFFFH.</td></tr>

	useful. ZEAP 2.0 can be in ROM at D000H or RAM at
	1000H.</td></tr>

	often enough to make it worth having in ROM? It
	could occupy C400 &ndash; CFFFH</td></tr>

All this brings us to memory mapping. So much is going on by
independent people, hoping to sell products under the Nascom banner,
that a meeting was held recently between Nascom Engineering, and other
interested parties. The aim; to ensure that there is room for
everything, and that everything can be kept under control. The meeting
primarily discussed a standard Nascom&nbsp;2 expanded to a maximum of 48K
and fitted with Nas-sys. Non standard Nascoms and disc based Nascoms
were not discussed as their memory requirements will be entirely
different. But everything decided is equally relevant to an expanded
Nascom&nbsp;1 fitted with Nas-sys.
</p>
<p>
One of the mains aims was agreed, and that is that no external
product can advertise that it is &lsquo;approved by Nascom&rsquo; unless it has
been submitted to Nascom for approval, and that it conforms to the
memory mapping laid down. Another aim was to produce a reccommended
memory map for use with Nascom&nbsp;2, but is was soon discovered that so
many diverse ideas were around that it was only possible to set out
guidelines, and that firmware producers would have to look at their
product to see where it could be sensibly fitted. This is in the
producer&rsquo;s interest, because if something is located in a daft place
then it inhibits its own market.
