He also has an EPROM programmer, a Teletype 43 Terminal and an acoustic
coupler. He is the designer of B-Bug, Nasbug and Nas-sys, which were
all designed for his own purposes, and later made available to Nascom.
His resposibility on the INMC is software problems, and software
related corespondence.

Derek Brough joined the committee in October, is 36, is married
with one child and lives in Barnet. He has a B.Sc, and is a lecturer in
computing sciences at a London college. He has played with computers
since school. He has an unexpanded Nascom&nbsp;1 fitted with a number of
hardware goodies, including joystick controls, and an interrupt driven
IBM printer. He also has access to expanded Nascoms through his work
(but says he usually can&rsquo;t get near them). He has recently undertaken
the incredible task of re-assembling the complete INMC library so that
the bulk of it may be used with Nas-sys. His main responsibility with
the INMC is the library, and he is the nearest to Librarian we have
got. He is also re-organizing the library to make sense of the various
breeds of programs now coming in; ie: minimum system Nasbug, expanded
system Nasbug, expanded system Nas-sys, Tiny Basic and 8K Basic.

Kerr Borland is 35 and he says, &ldquo;I was born to be a rich man&rsquo;s
son, unfortunately, my father didn&rsquo;t work hard enough&rdquo;. He also says,
&rdquo;I am qualified for absolutely nothing, and spends most of my time
doing what I am best qualified for!&rdquo;. He has also been known to say
that he is a most likeable fellow, and we have noticed that he often
tells us what a modest person he is. Kerr is Sales Director of Nascom,
is married with one or more children (we are not sure whether it&rsquo;s us
who don&rsquo;t know, or Kerr; Ed.), and lives in Totteridge. As president of
the INMC he is our &lsquo;inside contact&rsquo; with Nascom.

Paul Greenhalgh hails from the the north Country, is single,
24, and lives in Chesham. He has worked for an Electricity Board, and
an electronic security firm and until recently he worked for Nascom. He
is now employing his talents with a components supply company and
Nascom distributor. He doesn&rsquo;t have a Nascom, but since leaving Nascom
is saving his pennies to get one. He has tinkered with computers since
leaving university, where he graduated with a B.Sc. On the INMC he is
responsible for getting all the bits for the newsletter together, final
editorial, pasteup, getting the newsletter printed, and distibution.

David Hunt is 34, lives in Harrow, has three children, and is
still married despite his Nascom. He was trained as an electronics
development engineer, leaving college with an HNC. After leaving the
electronics field he went into retailing, starting in Hi-fi and later
with a retail electronics company (not the same one as Paul), where he
has been General Manager for the past five years. He has only been
playing with computers for about 3 years, and was in the process of
designing a kit for his company to market when Nascom&nbsp;1 came along. He
promptly dropped his own design, and is now a Nascom distributor. He
owns a 32K Nascom&nbsp;1 running Nas-sys and Nasbug, ZEAP, Naspen and 8K
Basic. All firmware is kept on an 8K EPROM board, and his Nascom is
fitted with programable graphics and high speed CUTS interfaces, he
also has a TI 745 terminal. As INMC chairman, he keeps an eye on the
hardware side of things, and acts as editor before passing copy on to
Paul.
