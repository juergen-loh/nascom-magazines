A NOVEL WAY OF EXPANDING A NASCOM&nbsp;1
</h1>
<h3 class="author">
Suggested by Mr. L. E. Gilham of Bedfont.
</h3>
<p>
If you have a 1K monitor on a NASCOM&nbsp;1 a convenient way of
expanding by 1K is to put a MK4118 (1K x 8) in the spare EPROM socket.
This is done by bending Pins 18,19,20,21 straight and connecting them
to CE (old Pin 20), +5v, RD, WR respectively either by putting the chip
in a socket and then bending this socket and putting it in the socket
on the board or by bending the chip pins and using &lsquo;Soldercon&rsquo; pins.
This will give another 1K of RAM from 0400H to 07FFH.
