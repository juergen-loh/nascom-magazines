<p>
A few newsletters back we did an article about the PIO
(MK3881), and tried to get readers out of the &lsquo;Catch 22&rsquo; situation,
where the PIO technical manual could only be understood if the reader
knew something about PIO&rsquo;s. The article dealt with the general aspects
of the PIO, and how to use it. Well Richard has been busy, and has sent
us this:

<h2>
<u>Understanding the PIO</u>
</h2>
<p>
The PIO manual provides a good description of how this powerful
device works, but there are some aspects of it which are not easy to
understand. Perhaps the most confusing of all is the use of the
&lsquo;handshake&rsquo; signals, known as STROBE and READY lines. This article will
briefly explain how input and output modes work, and then will give an
example showing how two PIO&rsquo;s can communicate, when one is the output
and the other is the input.
</p>
<h2>
<u>Input mode</u>
</h2>
<p>
The PIO port must be set to mode 1 and interrupts enabled.
As usual the I register, interrupt vector and interrupt mode must
be set up correctly, and the PIO must not think that it is
already processing an interrupt, so a dummy RETI instruction
should be executed. Also, when in input mode, a dummy read should
be issued once at the start to initialize handshaking. At last
you are ready to enable the CPU interrupts with an EI
instruction.
</p>
<h4>
The sequence of events is as follows:
</h4>
<p>
The input STROBE line goes from low to high, indicating that
data is ready in the PIO input register. This change causes an
interrupt, and the interrupt routine gets the data with an IN
instruction. Issuing this instruction gets the data and also
causes the PIO READY output line to go from low to high,
indicating that the data has been received. The interrupt
routine ends by enabling the CPU interrupts again and then
immediately returns with a RETI, which re-enables the PIO
interrupts.
</p>
<h2>
<u>Output mode</u>
</h2>
<p>
The PIO port must be prepared as for input mode, except
that it is set to mode 0.
</p>
<h4>
The sequence of events is as follows:
</h4>
<p>
The input STROBE line goes from low to high, indicating
that the previous output has been received. This change causes
an interrupt, and the interrupt routine outputs the data with
an OUT instruction. Issuing this instruction not only outputs
the data to the PIO, but also causes the PIO READY line to go
high, indicating that data is ready in the PIO. The interrupt
