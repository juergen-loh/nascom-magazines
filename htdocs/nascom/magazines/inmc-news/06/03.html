<p class="continued">
explained in detail, but it is pity that no abrieviated list of
commands was given.
</p>
<p>
Essentially there are two modes, the command/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>edit mode and the
append/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>insert mode. In all there are 44 commands (43 in the VT version)
which are may be considered in six groups.
</p>
<ol class="paranthesis">
<li>
A and I are the append and insert modes. Append places text at
the end of the text, insert places text within the text. Lower
case commands c, d, and i, change, delete and insert single
characters in the edit mode. D deletes a line in the edit mode.
M is used to move chunks of text around within the text.
</li>
<li>
C, G, L, S, s, X, 1, 2, 3 and 4 are all formatting commands. 1,
2, 3 and 4 set up the line and page lengths. L left justifies
the text to width, whilst S and s left/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>right justify the text
to width, inserting extra spaces as required. G generates pages
to length, whilst C and X remove the affects of formatting.
</li>
<li>
Finding bits of text is important, and the F, f and a commands
will find strings of up to 40 characters within the text.
</li>
<li>
Commands for entering and saving text to tape are covered by
the R, W and V (VS version only) commands. There is also a
special tape command, the J command, which will insert an
incoming tape in front of text already the Naspen.
</li>
<li>
Moving the cursor about within the text is perhaps the most
important facility of any text editor, and Naspen has no less
than 14 cursor move commands. The text and cursor may be set
back to the start, the cursor may skip backwards and forwards
in pages, lines, tens of characters or singly. Making it very
easy to position the cursor anywhere in the text.
</li>
<li>
The last group are all unrelated. The K command will kill text
and because of its irreversible action is protected against
accidental use by the Y command. N returns Naspen to the
monitor, whilst P prints the text. Commands 5 and 6 set
the repetition rate of the repeat keyboard.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In use we found Naspen very easy to get on with, and in preparing
<a href="../../../#head">INMC pages</a> it is wonderful, as none of us qualify as typists,
the ability to skip through what we have done, then correct it with out
having to retype the lot has saved an enormous ammount of time. As
mentioned elsewhere, we shunt &lsquo;Pen&rsquo; tapes about, edit them and finally
print them on an old IBM printer. Incidentally, you may have noticed we
have avoided the &lsquo;pound sign&rsquo; in this text. Not because &lsquo;Pen&rsquo; can&rsquo;t use
it, but because the IBM golfball doesn&rsquo;t have one.
</p>
<p>
In all Naspen seems a very versatile and worthwhile addition to
the Nascom stable for those who want a reliable text editor. we have
found that it covers all normal (sic) facilities in a very easy to use
package. It takes about three hours to get conversant with it. And as a
final recommendation, takes a look at these two pages. It&rsquo;s a real pity
it doesn&rsquo;t find the spelling mistakes as well!! That would be really
something to shout about.
