Eddie Pounce joined the committee in October, is 27, is married
with two children and lives in Watford. He has been playing with
computers since leaving school, and throughout his university training,
where he gained a B.Sc Hons. in computing. He is a data administrator
for a large multi-national company working in London. He owns a Nascom
2 with Naspen, and fitted with an automatic double cassette I/O with
auto. stop/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>start. He is equally at home with machine level code, Basic,
and the hardware side of things, and has a general background in both
mainframe, mini and micro computing. On the INMC he acts as sub-editor,
and deals with technical corespondence.
</p>
<p>
So now you know who we are; as to the INMC itself, we meet
about once every two months to chew over recent developments, and get
feedback from each other. Corespondence is usually farmed out between
members by post, and the letters are dealt with by the individuals,
poor Paul seems to &lsquo;cop&rsquo; most of them. Newsletter bits are usually
rewritten (we call it editing) by Richard, Paul, Eddie and Dave, in
most cases on Naspen tapes. Drafts are printed usually on the TI
printer, and Paul and Dave have a late night session putting it all
together to find out how much we&rsquo;ve got. We usually aim for about 30
pages. If we are short of copy, some programs are rooted out and
printed to make up the space.
</p>
<p>
Final editing is carried out on the Naspen tapes and printed on
an IBM printer on A4 sheets, Paul then takes the lot, pastes it all up,
filling spare bits as he goes. At this late stage Chas. is chivvied up
to come up with another &lsquo;Lawrence&rsquo; and any other line drawings
required, and the whole lot sent to the printers. When it is all
printed, the girls at Nascom get landed with seeing that they all get
posted.
</p>
<p>
So thats who we are and what it is all about. The whole process
usually takes about two months, and a lot of copy for the next
newsletter is on file even before the previous one is &lsquo;put to bed&rsquo;. So
when you send us letters or copy, don&rsquo;t despair if it doesn&rsquo;t turn up
in the next newletter, we&rsquo;re horrors for holding things over to the
next <a href="../text/"></a>issue. But the final message is we still need copy, keep it
coming. We want reviews on MAPP1-3Z and the cheap colour graphics which
is knocking around. We also want a review on any EPROM programmers.
Please.

<u class="double">NASCOM&nbsp;1 VDU PROBLEM &ndash; IC&nbsp;18 MODIFICATION</u>
</h4>
<p>
Mr. L. E. Gilham of Bedfont asked us to clarify the position
with regard to the modification to IC&nbsp;18 to cure the problem with the
VDU when a space is displayed where a letter should be.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
The problem is around the timing of the character decoding in IC&nbsp;16 and
is corrected by:
</p>
<ol class="paranthesis">
<li>
Bending Pin 5 of IC&nbsp;18 straight so that it is not connected
when IC&nbsp;18 is in the socket.
</li>
<li>
Connecting Pin 5 to Pin 12 of IC&nbsp;18 on the underside of the
board.
</li>
</ol>
