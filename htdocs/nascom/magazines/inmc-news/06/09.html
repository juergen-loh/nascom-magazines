	Difficulty has been reported in identification of certain
	capacitors. Though it is not possible to guarantee that all
	manufacturers follow this convention, it is suggested that
	capacitors marked 102 be regarded as 1n and those marked 100
	as 100p unless there are obvious signs to the contrary (size,
	or the possession of a positive lead).</td></tr>
