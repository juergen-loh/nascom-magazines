As you will notice, firmware which is unlikely to be used
together has been assigned coresidence. For example, no-one is likely
to want to use the colour graphics firmware (which runs under Basic)
with REVAS (which is a machine code disassembler). Similarly, any
extensions to Naspen may be made from B000 &ndash; B7FF, as with a more
powerful word processor in residence, extensions to the operating
system would hardly be required, and so on. However, extensions to the
Basic could imply the use of a more powerful operating system, or a
software number cruncher such as MAPP1-3Z could be put in place of
ZEAP, and used to extend the precision of the Basic math to 14 digits
(if any one has done this please let us know).

<p>
So please bear these suggestions in mind in writing your
software, that way maximum portability, and least inconvenience is
caused.

more for a real one&rdquo;. Well we don&rsquo;t know, but in general the Nascom
keyboard costs rather more (not less) than the average ASCII keyboard
fitted to competing computers, and is a very rugged and superior
product. We don&rsquo;t know why all the control is done in software, as it
would have cost little more to make the keyboard truly ASCII. Mind you,
a software controlled keyboard lets you do lots of clever things which
a hardware keyboard could never do (look at the N Ray Moonlander
program for instance). Finally, does it really matter, as ASCII
keyboards can easily be run into PORT 0 with very little modification
to the software if required.
