all of five minutes. I now have an 8 AMP bridge which, although bigger,
can be easily fitted with the aid of a piece of aluminium which also
serves as a heat sink.
</p>
<p>
Since the RAM board draws about one and a half amps a healthy
earth is required &ndash; a thick piece of wire from the power supply to the
expansion board. However, this creates an earth loop, which perhaps is
not desirable. (Suggest that all earths then taken from expansion board
Ed.)

<u class="double">Getting It Working</u>
</h4>
<p>
With the kit now assembled and 8K of RAM plugged in that should
have been the end of the story, but there were the inevitable problems.
The memory could be read from and written to&nbsp;, but very soon the
machine would lock up. On power-up everything looked fine but the
system would not initialise properly on pressing the reset key. Many
hours were spent looking for non-existant faults. Eventually it became
apparent that the MEMEXT signal was at fault but not why. With the
internal memory select used there was no problem. With external memory
select used the problem reappeared, but on monitoring MEMEXT with an
AVO it disappeared again. In an attempt to cure the fault the chips at
each end of the MEMEXT signal were changed but to no avail. Since the
AVO cured the problem a resistor was soldered between the signal line
and earth, this made a minor improvement. Next a capacitor was tried
between the signal and earth at the NASCOM&nbsp;1 end, this fixed it.
Decoupling the expansion board end had no effect.

<h4>
<u class="double">Conclusion</u>
</h4>
<p>
This board is not easy to build and may require a small
decoupling capacitor to be added to the main N1 board on the MEMEXT
line. Having this signal so close to the earth and the +5v lines would
appear not to be a good idea. A criticism of the design is that
tri-state buffers are used unnecessarily on the control and address
lines, surely ordinary buffers would have done the job. Since getting
this expansion working I have experienced no other problems and am very
happy with it.

Mr. Curtiss neglected to mention the manufacturers of this
product, but we believe it is the one supplied by Comp Components of
Barnet.

There were a couple of other points in the letter attached to
Mr. Curtiss&rsquo; article which ought to be mentioned. One of the reasons he
gave for choosing the S-100 mother board was that it allowed greater
choice of &lsquo;goodies&rsquo; that may be fitted. Whilst generally true, this
particular board is not truly S-100 compatible, and may give rise to
problems under special circumstances. Another reason was that in his
opinion the Nas-bus was responsible for some of the trouble experienced
with Nascom expansion. In our opinion the trouble is not concerned with
the Nas-bus but with the series 1 memory card. Happily these troubles
can all be cured. Finally Mr. Curtiss asks why a non ASCII keyboard was
chosen for Nascom and says, &ldquo;Surely it would only cost a few pounds
