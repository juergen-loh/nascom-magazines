T30 MOON-LANDER 0C50--0FEC &pound;1.50
</p>
<p>
Ingenious moon-landing program using keyboard as &ldquo;crash-pad
joystick&rdquo;. Below 2500ft display expands to terrain
map, and when you land, look out for those boulders. Well
commented, good instructions, teletype assembly listing.
INMC games competition winner &ndash; object code listing in
INMC issue 3.

changed. Well commented, good instructions. (Nice demo,
not very practical).

T32 CARRE CHINOIS 0C50-0F3F &pound;1.50
</p>
<p>
We have no idea what this game is or what it does (we
ain&rsquo;t French is we?) Totally written (and presumably (?)
beautifully commented) in French.
