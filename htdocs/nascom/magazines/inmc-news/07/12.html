The ribbon cartridge is about 2&Prime; wide, by the full 10&Prime; width of
the platten. The ribbon is in the form of a continuous loop, and is
driven by a small capstan and pinch roller inside the cartridge. Drive
to the ribbon is by a small tongue which engages in a slot in the
ribbon capstan, and is driven from the head drive spiral. The ribbon
cartridge appears to hold an enormous amount of ribbon, probably about
50 yards which should last a few million characters. Don&rsquo;t open one and
spill the contents on the floor, it takes hours to wind it back. The
ribbon cartridge is slightly &lsquo;skewed&rsquo; in its mounting so that the left
hand side is lower than the right, this is so the head traverses the
ribbon diagonally, therebye avoiding ribbon wastage.

<h4>
The Electronics
</h4>
<p>
The electronics are quite a surprise, as they are loosely based
on a Nascom, using a Z80 processor, 1K RAM, 2K ROM, PIO and UART (add a
video RAM and a keyboard port and you could very well have a Nascom&nbsp;1).
A proper crystal controlled baud rate generator is fitted, and this
also provides the system clock. Power transistors driven by the PIO
feed the needle solenoids and stepper motors. The whole of the
circuitry is mounted an the double sided pcb of the usual Nascom
standard, with the main smoothing capacitor mounted on a bracket over
the pcb
</p>
<p>
All the printer timing functions are software derived and
controlled by the CPU which is being used in an interrupt driven mode.
Incoming data is stored in the RAM, which has about 950 bytes free as
buffer storage. The buffer is organized as a &lsquo;first in first out&rsquo; file
and a handshake signal goes active low when the buffer has only ten
bytes free. Parity&rsquo; and &lsquo;carriage return, carriage return/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>line feed&rsquo;
options are link selectable, as are the input BAUD rates between 75 and
9600 BAUD. Interestingly, the baud rate generator also outputs a clock
signal at 16 times the selected baud rate so that the Imp can drive the
sending device UART at speeds higher than normally be possible.
</p>
<p>
Internally the Imp&rsquo;s appearance is functional but untidy. The
mechanism chassis and the pcb both being mounted on a heave gauge black
anodized aluminium pressing. The connecting cables to mains transformer
and function switches are secured by &lsquo;double side-sticky&rsquo; to the tops
of components on the pcb. Not exactly professional practice, but
adequate.
</p>
<p>
The Imp is cased in an attractive (although slightly too
&lsquo;bright&rsquo;) blue moulded plastic cover, which whilst flexible appeared
robust enough for the purpose. It is unfortunate that Nascom have
succeeded in making this very cheap and functional printer look cheap
as well. The metallized stick-on plastic strip right across the front,
bearing the legend &lsquo;Nascom micro IMP&rsquo; in letters 1.5&Prime; high completely
ruins the otherwise neat appearance. A small discreet badge would have
been a much better idea.
</p>
<h4>
On Test
</h4>
<p>
On unpacking the IMP, it was immediately apparent that the
packing would not adequate in the hands of the Great British Post
Office, and we suggest that the paper roll carrying arms be removed
