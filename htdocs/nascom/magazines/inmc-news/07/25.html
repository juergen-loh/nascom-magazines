When the NASCOM users&rsquo; newsletter announced its competition for an
entertaining program to run on a 1Kbyte machine it seemed immediately
apparent to two certain people that an entry developed on their machine
should most certainly be submitted. Sadly, though, they were revising
at the time for finals (congratulations, incidentally, to them both)
and had not the time required to squeeze any of their amazing programs
into the requisite tiny space. Not for nothing, though, had they spent
so much time in the company of Arthur Norman (see previous articles in
DATABUS for samples of his work!) &ndash; with a pair of malicious grins
almost worthy even of him, they remarked &ldquo;Arthur and Chris can write
some code for it&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
This suggestion did not fall on entirely stony ground. Both Arthur and
I have a fairly long record as hackers of the
<?php externalLink("PDP-7"); ?>
and he has
additional vast experience of entertaining software on many assorted
machines. We both felt that the time had arrived to get fairly close to
the machine code of a modern microprocessor, and what better machine
could there be than the Z80? Furthermore, what could be a more amenable
introduction than the challenge of writing a fun program to meet a
deadline?
</p>
<p>
I must admit that we were both quite strongly taken aback to discover
that the aforementioned deadline was less than two weeks away, but with
mutual cries of encouragement we nerved ourselves for the fray,
carrying the poor innocent NASCOM off to to the fifth floor of the
Computer Laboratory Tower and denoting ourselves the FIFth FLOor
SOftware company.

One of the factors influencing our choice of program to write was the
shortage of available time, not only to implement it, but even just to
decide what it should be. Some of the considerations influencing our
choice of a moonlander were
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis">
<li>
We each had some experience of looking at programs for this,
respectively on the
<?php externalLink("PDP-7"); ?>
and the
<?php externalLink("DEC GT40", "GT40", ""); ?>.
</li>
<li>
It seemed to us that the problem could be expanded or shrunk more or
less at will, and according to how well we were getting on with it.
</li>
<li>
The majority of moonlanders are BAD and BORING and we wanted to
write a half way competent one.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Having determined this fundamental point, we turned our attention to
the machine itself. A number of differences in philosophy from the
machines with which we were familiar brought themselves forcibly to our
attention. Probably the most significant of these was the bewildering
variety of available instructions: the
<?php externalLink("PDP-7", "", ""); ?>,
for example, has only a
four bit opcode in its eighteen bit word, and there are no prizes for
guessing how many instructions that gives it. By comparison with this,
eight bits of Z80 opcodes, most of the combinations of which are legal,
appeared to mean a great many more possibilities to consider.

<p>
Offset against this, we had occurences of the bewidering variety of the
