LAWRENCE THE LONG HAIRED WEIRDO
</h1>
<p>
We haven&rsquo;t heard from Lawrence this issue, but we did hear a rumour
that he was assisting the police with their enquiries. (Central Records
Computer seems to have crashed&nbsp;!)
</p>
<p>
We did, however, receive this communication from Doctor Dark. Is
Lawrence too embarrassed to show his snout&nbsp;?
