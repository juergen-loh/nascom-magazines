NASCOM IMP PRINTER
</h4>
<p>
printed using an Imp printer.
</p>
<p>
The Nascom Imp printer is a comparatively cheap dot matrix
printer, printing 80 characters per line on plain paper using an
imported American mechanism and electronics designed by Nascom. As
Nascom do not have an electronic assembly facility, the Imps are
constructed by a sub-contractor in Scotland. The mechanism is designed
for bi-directional printing (more about that later), and will accept
friction fed unperforated paper up to 8.5&Prime; wide, or tractor driven
perforated paper up to 9.5&Prime; wide.
</p>
<h4>
The Mechanism
</h4>
<p>
The mechanism chassis is a through shaped 16g steel pressing,
cadmium plated to avoid corrosion. Although not very rigid without the
remainder of the mechanism, the ingenious use of the 12g aluminium
platten and the head guide bar as stretchers produces a remarkably
stable box like assembly. Paper and ribbon guides do not form a
structural part of the chassis, and are simply laid in slots in the
main chassis stamping. Two screws through the chassis side-plates
secure the head guide bar, and two screws at the rear secure the back
of the platten, the front of the platten being supported in slots in
the side-plates towards the front. These four screws poll the whole
chassis together, trapping the paper and ribbon guides at the same
time. By constructing the mechanism in this fashion adjustment of the
critical head to platten distance is particular easy to achieve, and
the whole idea leads to a very compact structure.
</p>
<p>
The 7 needle print head is transported across the paper by a
peg which engages with a three turn continuous spiral cut in what
appears to be a nylon (or delrin) shaft, approx. 1&Prime; in diameter, driven
by a stepper motor via a miniature toothed belt. The head transport
motor is secured to the left hand side-plate. Head to paper
registration is maintained by the precision ground steel guide which
is part od the chassis pressing. A nylon gear driven take-off at the
right hand end of the head spiral shaft drives the ribbon feed.
</p>
<p>
Paper feed is derived from a second stepper motor mounted on
the right hand side-plate, via nylon reduction gearing which drives the
aluminium forward friction feed roller directly and the tractor feed
via another miniature belt drive. The tractor assembly is a separate
part of the mechanism and is secured to the chassis by two large
screws. The tractors have levers which friction lock on to the tractor
bars, and it is possible to position the tractors at any point across
the paper width. Friction paper feed is made possible by a rubber
roller which may be engaged with the front friction feed roller by a
small lever mounted in front of the ribbon cartridge. The rubber roller
is held in place by strong springs and are adequate for most purposes,
but have been found to slip when &lsquo;interleaved carbon&rsquo; telex rolls have
been used (an unfair test perhaps?).
