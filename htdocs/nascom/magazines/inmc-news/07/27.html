gentle reader, is as follows: one can learn about Z80 code in one week
to write an entertaining and non-trifling program, and that makes the
Z80 a good thing by anybody&rsquo;s standards.

1. The chart below has the decimal equivalents of the Hex addresses of
the screens for Nascom&nbsp;1 &amp; 2. When using Basic, one has to POKE data
into the decimalised addresses on the screen, so this chart will help
all you Basic people to get your little men into the right positions
easily.
</p>
<p>
(Ed.&rsquo;s Note: Any position on the screen can be calculated by the Basic
using the equation P=1993 + X + 64 x Y, where X is the column (1-48), Y
the line (1-16), and P the decimal address of the desired location.)

2. On page 10 is a listing of the Nascom Graphics ROM. If a lot of
key-bashers have been scratching their heads trying to get their little
men to appear, then this ammended chart is sure to relieve their
dandruff, as the chart printed in the original Nascom&nbsp;2 handbook was
far from useful!
