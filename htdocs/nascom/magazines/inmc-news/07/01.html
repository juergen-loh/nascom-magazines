CHAIRMAN&rsquo;S BIT
</h1>
<p>
Well, here we are again, yet another action packed issue, and
only a month late (as usual). The Editor said, &ldquo;Final copy first week
April please.&rdquo; and as usual, we all ignored him until the last minute.
Still we&rsquo;ve got it all together, and it all goes off to the printers on
Monday.
</p>
<p>
Now to the financial bit, members pay 5.00 per year for six
issues, and what with rapidly rising postage and print costs, we are
actually running at a loss. We aren&rsquo;t broke yet, but we soon will be.
Part of the expense is letter writers who expect replies and don&rsquo;t send
stamps for return postage. NUDGE. If you want a reply, 12p please, or
you won&rsquo;t get one. Now we have no intention of foisting a surcharge on
members (so you can put your cheque books away), but to try and make a
bit of extra loot, we are going to start accepting advertising. Not a
bookful with a couple of pages of text lost somewhere in it, but we
reckon that if we sell a maximum of 5 pages per issue, we can then
afford to bring the newsletter up from 40 to 48 pages, and we&rsquo;ll
virtually cover our deficit. Maybe we&rsquo;ll make a modest profit. Who
knows, we might be able to reduce the subs next year.
</p>
<p>
To start with, we&rsquo;ve twisted Nascoms&rsquo; arm, and another
distributor. So if you sell goodies for Nascom, and you want to reach
about 2,500 &ldquo;Nasnuts&rdquo;, then approach the INMC. We bet we reach more
Nascom owners at once than all that expensive newstand advertising. Get
a slice of the action!!! Our rates are very modest.
</p>
<p>
Commercial over.

As you read this issue, it won&rsquo;t escape your attention that
there are an awful lot of (perhaps that should be lot of awful)
reviews. It didn&rsquo;t start out that way, but like &ldquo;Topsy&rdquo;, it &ldquo;Just
growed&rdquo;. Still, with this lot in print perhaps we can collect some loot
from those people we didn&rsquo;t slate too badly, as well as would be
advertisers. So we decided to turn this into a bumper reviews issue,
and get them all out of the way in one go. Hope you like it. A lot of
the reviews and articles have been submitted by members, and this is
very encouraging. Our thanks, keep them coming.

Back to the subject of readers letters. Paul has landed me with
a fair number this month, and a large number of those display a very
severe shortcoming of some Nascom owners and embryo programmers. They
can&rsquo;t read&nbsp;!!! Nascom manuals take a fair ammount of getting used to,
but it is all there, and the vast majority of it is all correct. I have
been tempted to write &lsquo;read the ****** manual&rsquo; over some of these
letters and send them back like that. My natural politeness and modesty
forbade. But I promise, next month I will. Its a lot quicker than
writing a letter.
</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;ve still got a lot of material left over for issue 8, so
we&rsquo;d better get on with it, in the meantime, happy programming.
