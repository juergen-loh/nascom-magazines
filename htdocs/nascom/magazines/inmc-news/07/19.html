<u class="double">MODIFICATIONS TO ZEAP 2.0</u>
</h2>
<p>
Here are details of some &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; modifications to ZEAP which we
have found useful. These cure two minor bugs, and provide a valuable
new feature&nbsp;:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
Bug 1: After an assembly, the margin to the right of the bottom line
is corrupt, which enables the cursor to be moved off the screen, and
can cause the top line to move when editing the bottom line. This is
cured.
</p>
<p>
Bug 2: When using the H command to set the number of lines, and then
repeatedly using the Z command for editing, it becomes necessary to
press a key to display the line to be edited. This is cured.
</p>
<p>
Additional feature: Type a colon (:) and press ENTER. The message
&rdquo;Command?&rdquo; is displayed, and the system waits for you to enter a
NAS-SYS command, which is then obeyed. On completion of this command,
control remains within ZEAP. This makes it very easy to use the Read
and Write commands to save the source file or object program. It can
also be useful to use the Tabulate and Modify commands to examine
memory locations. To provide this feature it has been necessary to
remove the Q command from ZEAP, but this command has been superceded by
the J and K commands.
