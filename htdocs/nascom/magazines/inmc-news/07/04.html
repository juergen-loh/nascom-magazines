Dear INMC Committee,
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your work in putting together an ever improving
newsletter.
</p>
<p>
Twelve months ago I was in the same position as Mr. Hewitt (Letters,
<a href="../../../05/06/text/#article2">INMC5</a>).
After playing around with machine code and Zeap, I have now
reached the stage where I have written a quite effective control
program nearly 2K long, which sends and receives &ldquo;Tonebursts&rdquo; via a
radio link, to identify the outstation, and cause certain operations to
occur.
</p>
<p>
My message to Mr. Hewitt and people in his position is to stick at it,
and particularly the section in the Program Manual on building up a
simple program and stepping through it.
</p>
<p>
But I really do not think it is on to advise a beginner to try to start
on such a complex program as Lollipop Lady.
</p>
<p>
By the way, I suggest all newcomers try to learn about machine code as
well as Basic, as m/c is much more satisfying and can do so much more.
</p>
<p>
A couple of requests &ndash; probably impractical &ndash; but who knows?
</p>
<ol class="parenthesis">
<li>
Is it possible to publish or make available in the library, more
information on NAS&nbsp;SYS? I have in mind perhaps some simpler
flowcharts and more data on what each routine does to registers etc.
This would make it easier to use the many routines available.
</li>
<li>
Could the software library offer, at some reasonable cost, a
cassette option for longer programs?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Yours sincerely,<br>
C. Bowden<br>
Truro, Cornwall.

We have had quite a few requests for more info. on Nas-Sys, so we&rsquo;ll
see what we can do. Any offers? As to cassettes, we have discussed
this, but we feel it will be some time before we can offer this
service.

Dear Sirs,
</p>
<p>
Thanks for publishing my letter in
<a href="../../../05/07/text/#article1">issue&nbsp;5</a> and attempting to help.
However shortly after writing to you I purchased a &ldquo;Line graphics
generator&rdquo; from Comp Shop and after fitting this to my Nascom&nbsp;1 all my
problems became perfectly clear &ndash; 3 rows of my V.D.U. had bit 7 stuck
permanently high.
