BASIC extra &amp; Memory mapping update
</h1>
<h2>
BASIC &ldquo;PRINT USING&rdquo; STATEMENT
</h2>
<p>
The Nascom 8K Microsoft Basic does not support any kind of
&lsquo;Format statement&rsquo;, such as &lsquo;PRINT USING&rsquo;, a fact which can be annoying
if you wish to produce a column of figures. For example, if you wish to
produce a list of items and prices and the prices are say&nbsp;... 12.00,
6.56, 145.02, 0.32 ... then using the straight forward &lsquo;PRINT&rsquo; command
this would appear as:&ndash; rather than:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
12 12.00<br>
6.56 6.56<br>
145.02 145.02<br>
.32 0.32
</p>
<p>
One way to obtain the column on the right is to use a
subroutine to do the formatting for you. The Basic supports a good set
of string functions that makes the implementation of such a subroutine
a fairly simple matter. An example of such a routine is given below.
The variable A (amount) has to be set to the amount (in pounds) to be
printed before the subroutine is called. It returns with the formatted
output in A$. It works for both positive and negative numbers.

<h2>
MEMORY MAPPING &ndash; more information
</h2>
<p>
Following the article on memory mapping in the last INMC
newsletter (No. 6), here are some brief details of memory usage in the
area 0C00H &ndash; 0CFFH, which is intended for use as workspace for the
operating system software and your own programs if you are desparate.
</p>
<p>
&ndash; 0C00H &ndash; 0C7FH NAS-SYS work space. See NAS-SYS manual for details.
</p>
<p>
&ndash; 0C80H &ndash; 0CFFH Possible extended system workspace. 00C90H &ndash; 0CFFH is
used by the repeat keyboard routine which is listed
in INMC newletter No. 6.
</p>
<p>
&ndash; 0D00H &ndash; 0DFFH Workspace for possible future system software, is
also used for Naspen stack and &lsquo;Find string&rsquo; space.
</p>
<p>
&ndash; 0E00H &ndash; 0EFFH Workspace for NAS-DIS and D-BUG, including D-BUG
stack.
</p>
<p>
&ndash; 0F00H &ndash; 0FFFH Workspace for ZEAP, followed by the user. stack
(0F80H &ndash; 0FFFH).
</p>
<p>
There is no reason why areas of RAM should not be used for
different purposes by different pieces of software. The above usage of
0D00H &ndash; 0FFFH is applicable in the machine code/assembler programming
environment. Once in Basic, 0D00H &ndash; 0F80H is free for you to POKE or
DOKE your machine routines into. We recommend that you use 0D00H
upwards for these &ndash; we doubt you will run out of space since most of
these routines are only about 30 bytes long and we have seen one which
was two bytes long!
