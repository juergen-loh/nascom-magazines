before shipment. The documentation was accurate, and contained all the
information required to get the Imp up and running, with the 100 odd
sheets of fanfold perforated paper also provided. The documentation
also contained complete software listings of the operating system, and
circuit diagrams, although the style of the circuit drawings left a lot
to be desired. The documentation also gave a listing to use the
handshake with a Nascom, and this was tried and worked. Close
examination revealed that the mains fuse fitted (500mA) did not tally
with the circuits (850mA), and cases of fuses blowing without reason
have been traced to this cause. Internally one screw (on the head guide
bar) was found to be only finger tight. Everything else was in order.
</p>
<p>
A bit of Naspen text was tried, and the result was most
acceptable, the character set being well chosen, given the restrictions
of the 7 x 7 dot matrix with no decenders. The only confusing
characters being the lower case &lsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;g&rsquo;. However, it was noted that
the printer was only printing in one direction. This seemed odd until
it was discovered that that software counts the characters per line (it
doesn&rsquo;t count spaces) and if there are more than 40 printable
characters on one line, then the printer does not print in the reverse
direction. This allows time for the print head to cool down between
lines.
</p>
<p>
Next a bit of Basic listing was tried., and, as the lines were
shorter, bidirectional printing occured on almost all lines. It was
then that it was noticed that the characters did not line up in
columns, but that the characters printed in the right &ndash; left direction
were displayed about half a character width to the right. The cause was
found to be the right hand limit microswitch. It seems that the
software starts counting the character positions as soon as the switch
is released by the print head, and as this is a mechanical device with
a fiddly and critical adjustment, this was incorrectly set at the
factory. It took about ten minutes to get this switch correct (which
probably explains why it wasn&rsquo;t done properly in the first place), but
the result was well worth it! Perfectly regular columns.
</p>
<p>
The Imp will take rolls of paper (telex rolls are very cheap),
sheets (which are little awkward to feed), and perforated paper (which
is trifle more expensive). The results were impressive at all times,
and the printer averaged about 50 characters per second, bearing in
mind that the print head had to do a full traverse even if only one
character was printed on a line. The noise level was acceptable in a
domestic environment, although aggravated by a resonant living room
table.
</p>
<p>
At the price, the printer is probably beyond the reach of the
pockets of many who would like one, but at the price should make some
of the big boys sit up and take notice. The Imp is small, light and
mechanically and electrically sound (although a little tweaking won&rsquo;t
go amiss), and certainly very good value for money.
</p>
<p>
As the whole thing is software controlled perhaps we can look
forward to software selectable character sizes, and perhaps even
graphics. All of which could be achieved with suitable rewriting of the
software. Nascom warn users about against having a go at the software, and we
endorse this, as any mistakes in the software are likely to be very
expensive.
