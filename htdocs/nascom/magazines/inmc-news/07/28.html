Two new items of software are about to be released and these
have been reviewed by the INMC committee to see how good they are.

</h2>
<p>
NAS-DIS is a disassembler, which means that it takes any
machine code program and produces an assembler listing from it. This
source code, if assembled, is certain to generate the original machine
code program again. Disassemblers are very useful in examining machine
code programs so that you can work out what they do and make any
changes required.
</p>
<p>
NAS-DIS is a direct descendent of REVAS, and has been written
by the same author, David Parkinson. However, It is a vast improvement
over the original, and this review can only describe some of its many
features. It comes in two versions, either on a tape which can be used
to produce a copy of NAS-DIS located at whatever address you choose, or
as three EPROMs located at C400H&nbsp;&ndash; CFFFH. It is 3K long and runs only
under NAS-SYS.
</p>
<p>
It is most convenient on the Nascom&nbsp;2 to have a separate memory
board for RAM, and to use the eight sockets on the CPU board for <?php externalLink("2708"); ?>
EPROMs. In this case, four can be used for ZEAP&nbsp;2 (Nascom assembler),
and three for NAS-DIS. This makes sense, as NAS-DIS is fully compatible
with ZEAP, which means the output of NAS-DIS can be fed into ZEAP
without alteration. In fact the assembler output from NAS-DIS can be
generated in several ways. It can be simply listed on the screen, or
printed, or output to tape, or can even automatically become a ZEAP
source file in memory. Printed output can be split into numbered pages
with titles, and the tape output is also compatible with ZEAP so that
it can be fed directly back into ZEAP.
</p>
<p>
An option normally selected is the automatic generation of
labels. All locations addressed within the program are given labels,
making it easy to read the code. Furthermore, a complete cross
reference table can be output, showing every address where each label
is refered to. This is very valuable when tracing backwards through the
logic of a program.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to specify that some areas of memory are
data areas, so that these are not converted to spurious assembler
codes. In this case DEFB instructions appear.
</p>
<p>
NAS-DIS can, optionally, take account of NAS-SYS restart
features, namely SCAL, RCAL and Print String (PRS). With SCAL and RCAL,
the next byte is output as a DEFB. With PRS, NAS-DIS generates as many
DEFM lines as are needed for the message.
</p>
<p>
If you don&rsquo;t want to spend any time thinking which options to
use, you can simply execute NAS-DIS and specify the start address to
disassemble at. This means that any piece of code can be disassembled
almost instantly.
