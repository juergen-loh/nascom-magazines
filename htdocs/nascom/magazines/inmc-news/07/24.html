Minimum Nascom&nbsp;1 with Nasbug T2&nbsp;? Then you NEED more memory and have an
empty EPROM socket.
</p>
<p>
Well, there is a nice static RAM chip, the MK4118, which is pin
compatible with the 2708 EPROM. I should say ALMOST pin compatible.
This is a way to put the chip in, leaving the board and socket
unadulterated in case you wish to put an EPROM back there.
</p>
<p>
Here are the pin out differences:
</p>
<table class="indent" style="width: 60%">
<tr><td>Pin No.   </td><td><?php externalLink("2708"); ?>         </td><td>4118   </td></tr>
<tr><td>18        </td><td>Program      </td><td>CS     </td></tr>
<tr><td>19        </td><td>VDD (+12V)   </td><td>L (RD) </td></tr>
<tr><td>20        </td><td>CS           </td><td>OE (RD)</td></tr>
<tr><td>21        </td><td>VBB (-5V)    </td><td>WE (WR)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The pins on the MK4118 would object to being bent out, so put a socket
with flexible pins between the RAM and board socket (See Dr. Dark&rsquo;s
Page &ndash; Ed.). Bend out pins 18, 19, 20, 21. Connect leads to these pins
and connect to the printed circuit as required. The points I used were
these:
</p>
<p>
Pin 18 to E select line which has a through plated hole near pins 12
and 13 of IC36.
</p>
<p>
Pins 19 and 20 connected together to the inverted Read Data line which
has a through plated hole just out from pin 9 of IC44.
</p>
<p>
Pin 21 to the inverted Write Data line which has a through plated hole
near IC50 going to pin 3 of IC50.
</p>
<p>
As an extra safety measure, put insulating tape over the board socket
holes for pins 18 to 21 and double check the voltages at the
intermediate socket without the RAM in.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing there is a worldwide shortage of MK4118s, but
this should ease off once the backlog of NM&rsquo;s order for Nascom&nbsp;2
requirements has been met. Ring around the suppliers, you could be
lucky as you only need one. With time the price should drop quite a lot
from the present twenty pound level.

<p>
Mr. F. Whitby wrote in to inform us that when using the 8K BASIC (or
any other program), you get &ldquo;Escape&rdquo; by holding down &ldquo;@&rdquo;, then pressing
&ldquo;Shift&rdquo; and holding it down, then pressing &ldquo;3&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
All other control keys are different with B-BUG, as the B-BUG manual
explains.
