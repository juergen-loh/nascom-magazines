Manufacturer: William Stuart System Ltd.
</p>
<p>
Price: 45.00 inc. vat and p&amp;p.
</p>
<p>
What it does: Each character block is divided into 4 pixels, either 2x2
or 1x4 (chosen by a link), making either 96x32 or 48x64 pixels on the
screen. Each block can be 1 of 8 colours (red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan, white, black) and the whole background can be the same 1
of 8 colours. They are programmed per block as:
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>bit 7</td><td>= 0 for normal characters</td></tr>
<tr><td>bit 7</td><td>= 1 for graphics</td></tr>
<tr><td>bits 0-3</td><td>= 1 bit per pixel</td></tr>
<tr><td>bits 4-6</td><td>= 1 to 8 colours</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Background colours are programmed from 3 bits of an output port.
</p>
<p>
How it comes: As a kit of 2 pcbs (why not 1 ?). IC sockets for most of
the ICs. The 2 pcbs are Colour Modulator and Graphics Generator.
Instructions are clear but assume a knowledge of kit building. Two
useful subroutines are included, Line plot and Point plot. One demo
program as well.
</p>
<p>
What it&rsquo;s like: It plugs in the aerial socket and connects to the
Nascom pcb by soldering wires onto the back of the pcb; these
connections break easily. Easy to set up. Colours are good, except for
blue (slight ghosting). I didn&rsquo;t like the background colours (hard to
read characters on some colours). Resolution too low for a lot of uses,
but very good for boxes around messages, bar charts, and for similar
uses.

I had just fitted my Nascom&nbsp;1, plus buffer board, plus 8K RAM board,
plus psu, plus auto tape load board, into a Vero box and, as you can
imagine, there was not much room left inside. THEN I saw the William
Stuart advert in the computer mags.
</p>
<p>
The address of the company was at a place some 20 miles away, so I went
along and took a look, no harm in that I thought&nbsp;! Upon arrival I was
greeted with a demo of the system on a 26&Prime; colour television. It was
quite impressive and when I was shown a kaleidoscope program I was
hooked and began to think of how I could cram it into my computer case.
