<h3>
<u>FEEDBACK AT LAST!</u>
</h3>
<p>
Just when I was beginning to wonder whether anyone was reading my
articles, the INMC forwarded a letter to me from R.L.D. Boxwell. Master
Boxwell, who is fourteen, has been trying out unknown opcodes, and has
found a remarkable total of eighty-one of them, which I shall pass on
now. Since (presumably) the Z80 chip is only tested for the instructions
that appear in the book, they may not all work on your Nascom. He
doesn&rsquo;t count these in his total:
</p>
<p class="center">
CB30 &nbsp; CB31 &nbsp; CB32 &nbsp; CB33 &nbsp; CB34 &nbsp; CB35 &nbsp; CB36 &nbsp; CB37
</p>
<p>
(Ok, everyone knows those are shift logical lefts gone wrong, but look
at this lot!)
</p>
<?php columnEnd(1); ?>
<br>
<?php columnStart(2); ?>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-09-1.png"); ?>
<?php columnChange(2); ?>
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-09-2.png"); ?>
<?php columnEnd(2); ?>
<br>
<?php columnStart(1, "noindent justify"); ?>
<p>
Now there are 75 codes there, all of which must have uses. Then we
have:
</p>
<p class="indent">
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-09-3.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
The function of the following is not known, other than the fact that
they definitely do something:
</p>
<p class="indent">
<?php imageinsert($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-09-4.png"); ?>
</p>
<p>
(Whoever gets the job of re-typing that lot has my sympathy, and if
they get it all right they will also have my undying admiration!) (I&rsquo;d
rather have a drink, and give my NASPEN a rest! &ndash;Ed.)
