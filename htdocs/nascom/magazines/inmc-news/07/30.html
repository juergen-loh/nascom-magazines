D-BUG has several commands. These are entered by typing a colon
followed by the command letter. An excellent feature is the alternate
video RAM command, :0. This specifies a 1K block of RAM which is spare
in your system. It can be swapped with the NAS-SYS/D-BUG display by
using the command :A, pressing Enter returns the display to normal. The
two pages of the display are automatically swapped over during
execution (E or S commands), so that use of the screen for debugging
does not affect the display used by the program. This is invaluable for
testing programs which output information to the display and read it
back. (Don&rsquo;t forget to clear the alternate display before running your
program! Use :A then clear the screen).
</p>
<p>
D-BUG works by trapping all output via the UOUT jump, Since
this means the the UOUT jump has been used up and is no longer
available, for example, for driving a parallel printer, D-BUG provides
a command (:C) to set the address of your own U output routine.
</p>
<p>
A further feature is the :F command, which is used to find a
string of up to eight consecutive bytes. Even more, one or more of the
bytes may be specified as &lsquo;wild&rsquo;, for instance, if D-BUG were asked to
Find 2A&nbsp;&ndash; 0C (the &lsquo;dash&rsquo; means &lsquo;wild&rsquo;), D-BUG would find every location
where HL was loaded from a location between 0C000H and 0CFFH.
</p>
<p>
The only slight problem you might encounter fs if D-BUG is
activated while running a program which outputs a colon as the first
character of a line. D-BUG instantly grabs control and obeys&rsquo; the
&ldquo;command&rdquo;!
</p>
<p>
D-BUG is acivated by typing the command E C009 and can be
de-activated by the N command. A Nascom&nbsp;2 can be set to power up at
C000H, and in this case D-BUG is activated on power up or on pressing
Reset. It is necessary to re-activate D-BUG after using ZEAP.
</p>
<p>
Remember, you must have NAS-DIS and NAS-SYS in your system
before you can use D-BUG. We have tried D-BUG thoroughly, and have
found it to work well, we recommend it as a &lsquo;must&rsquo; for all machine code
addicts.

<p>
D-BUG was written for Nascom by Mick Scutt of CC SOFT, and is
available from Nascom through your local dealer. Contact your dealer
for details, and again if he doesn&rsquo;t know anything about it, have a go
at Nascom Sales Department for prices and availability.

<u class="double">XTAL BASIC V2.2</u>
</h2>
<p>
Some time ago Crystal Electronics announced an 8K Basic for
Nascom&nbsp;1. They have not stopped at that but have continued work on
improving it, and recently announced a completely new version Basic
2.2, which is for Nascom&nbsp;1 or 2 using T2, B-BUG, T4 or NAS-SYS
monitors. Since it has several major improvements over the previous
versions, we have decided to review it and compare it with the Nascom
8K Basic.
</p>
<p>
XTAL is a standard floating point 8K Basic, although in fact it
is only about 7.25K long. Crystal jokingly describe it as a 16K Basic
