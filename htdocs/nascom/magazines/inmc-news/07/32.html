PI This gives the value of PI

INCH This waits for an input character. This is extremely useful in
many programs.

KBD Checks for an input character and returns the value 0 if there
was no input. This makes it easy to write games programs where
fast reactions are required, and has many other uses.

ON ERR GOTO or GOSUB This is a remarkable addition to the Basic, and
allows any error during execution to be trapped and the
appropriate action taken. The variable ERR supplies the number
of the error, and the CMD$ function gives a full text
description of the error.

<p>
The XTAL Basic has another astonishing feature which is
extremely useful. You can add your own commands to the Basic,
specifying the name of the command, and the address at which you have
stored the machine code. This means that it would be easy for those
familiar with machine code to add the Nascom Basic commands which have
been omitted from the XTAL Basic. In fact the manual supplied gives the
code for the addition of DEEK and DOKE commands as an example. Another
feature is the backspace key allows one Basic statement to be executed
at a time, which is useful for debugging.
</p>
<p>
The XTAL Basic does not have the Nascom Basic WIDTH command,
which surprisingly, is an improvement, as the Nascom Basic command has
the annoying habit of putting out carriage returns when you don&rsquo;t want
them. DEEK, DOKE, and the graphics commands, SET, RESET and POINT are
also missing, but with the ability to extend the command table, could
easily be added.

<h2>
<u>Summary</u>
</h2>
<p>
The XTAL Basic is a good Basic with several useful enhancements
to the arbitary standard &lsquo;8K Basic&rsquo;. It is not compatible with Nascom
Basic, but the missing commands could be added. It would be better if
it used the NAS-SYS editing, but still had its own EDIT command, which
had advantages for long lines, using the cursor movement keys in the
standard way.
