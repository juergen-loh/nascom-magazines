Z80 Instant Programs &nbsp;

<p>
This paperback volume of 180 pages is published by the Sigma
Technical Press and costs 7.50. Sigma Technical Press, it seems, is no
relation to Sigma Accounting, the authors of ZEAP, the Nascom Z80
assembler. The book sets out to describe a number of Z80 based machine
code programs, many with little or no system monitor dependence. The
summary says that there are 36 programs listed, but having read the
volume I imagined there were more. The Programs cover most aspects of
machine code programming relevant to the home user, ranging from simple
delay loops, through simple arithmetic, to simple text handling
routines.
</p>
<p>
The book is primarily based on a Nascom&nbsp;1 fitted with a NASBUG
T2 monitor, and an appendix of the main monitor routines is given, the
implication being, that users of other Z80 based systems adapt the
programs given in the book to their system. Unfortunately, for
instance, the location of the screen memory (0800H &ndash; BFFH) is implicit
within the monitor routine, and therefore unlikely to be of help to
anyone not owning a Nascom fitted with NASBUG 172. Likewise, the
keyboard routine given is the routine for the Nascom software scanned
keyboard, and as Nascom is the only company using this particular
keyboard, it is not likely to be of much use to other Z80 system users.
These routines were however beautifully commented, in a particularly
easy to follow fashion, so whilst not much use to anyone other than a
Nascom owner, they provide a useful insight into the workings of these
monitor routines.
</p>
<p>
It is difficult to tell who the book is aimed at, as it
certainly is not at &lsquo;beginner&rsquo; level, there being nothing but the
sketchiest explanation of what the various registers are supposed to do
or how the Z80 works. No explanation is given regarding memory mapping
or how a certain area of the Nascom memory is set aside for the screen,
etc. There was a very simplified explanation of what an op-code is, but
the word &lsquo;operand&rsquo; did not seem to figure at all. To the more
experienced programmer, a lot of the detail in the explanations would
be dismissed as trivia. Although the programs were adequately explained
I feel the beginner would be left with the feeling that the machine
code instructions themselves were even more like black magic than when
he started.
</p>
<p>
Some interesting hardware examples were given, driving LEDs
from the ports, D &ndash; A and A &ndash; D converters, attaching a speaker to play
a music program, etc. Although these were not tried, there is every
reason to believe that they would work.
</p>
<p>
Many of the programs are long, and as an aid to correct
loading, a tape is available from the publishers. The tape is in Nascom
1 tape format and is unsuitable for Nascom&nbsp;2. Be warned, the first few
minutes of the tape are a spoken commentary, and of course, will not
load into the Nascom. Although I did not have the tape for the review,
those programs I typed in and tried worked.
