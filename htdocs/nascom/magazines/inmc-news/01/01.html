<u>Bristol Seminar</u>
</h3>
<p>
We held our third seminar, attended by over 200 people, at the Dragonara
Hotel in Bristol on October 14th. This time the lectures were biased towards
software and the titles were:
</p>
<p class="indent">
Is there a computer in the house?&nbsp;&ndash; Guy Kemey, Computing<br>
Microprocessors and Microprocessing&nbsp;&ndash; Vincent Tseng, ICL Dataskil<br>
Microprocessor Software&nbsp;&ndash; Jim Ayres, Harrow Technical College<br>
Assemblers, High Level languages and Operating Systems&nbsp;&ndash; Tony Rundle
Nascom Microcomputers Ltd.<br>
Interfacing&nbsp;&ndash; Paul Lister, Sussex University
</p>
<p>
Reprints of the papers will shortly be available at a price of &pound;1.50 each
and are recommended reading for Nascom owners.
</p>
<p>
Tiny Basic, Zeap and a prototype 32K Nascom were on display together with a
number of applications, programs including games and a text processing
system developed by Dataskil. We would like to thank everyone who came for
helping to make a thoroughly enjoyable day.

<u>Nasbus</u>
</h3>
<p>
First of all, an apology for the delay producing the extension RAM and
buffer boards. We have heard it said that there are no problems, only
opportunities. Well, we have been beset by opportunities&nbsp;&ndash; some technical,
some manufacturing. However the design is complete, pre-production prototypes
have been tested, and first deliveries will be mde in December.
</p>
<p>
The buffer board generates the Nasbus. This is a 77 way bus with some unique
features. In particular:
</p>
<ul class="dash indent">
<li>it does not require termination</li>
<li>it uses low cost, single sided connectors</li>
<li>it uses a low cost single sided backplane (motherboard)</li>
<li>it is designed to cater for 16 bit systems at some future date.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We are confident that the Nasbus will become a significant feature of the
microcomputer scene because of the simplicity, its low cost, and ability to
cope with the next generation of microprocessors. A full specification will
be available with the buffer boards in December.

<u>Power Supplies</u>

<p>
First of all, our apologies. A small batch of pcb&rsquo;s escaped with the ground
and output of IC1 incorrectly marked, and the +12V and &minus;12V markings reversed.
IC1 should be marked as
</p>
<?php imageCenter($imagepath, $magpath, $issuepath, $pagepath, "Image-01-1.png"); ?>
<p>
and the correct output order is
</p>
<p class="indent">
&minus;12V<br>
&minus;&nbsp;5V<br>
+12V<br>
+&nbsp;5V<br>
&nbsp; 0
