Load the routine using the &lsquo;&rsquo;M&rsquo; Command.

<li>
Execute a copy: C0C62 0C4D 03 &lsquo;NL&rsquo;

<li>
After the copy do not use the &lsquo;Reset&rsquo; until the tape load has been
completed. If the &lsquo;Reset&rsquo; is used the copy must be repeated.

Load as normal by &lsquo;L&rsquo; &lsquo;NL&rsquo;.

modification of line 11 and the copy (Instruction 2)

<h4>
<u>Explanation</u>
</h4>
<p>
Following a &lsquo;Reset&rsquo; the monitor program loads the scratchpad RAM locations
0C4E &amp; F with the address 0069. When the &lsquo;L&rsquo; command is executed the monitor
obtains the address of the routine to be used from 0C4E &amp; F (normally 0069) and
executes this routine. By use of the copy command to modify the address held
in 0C4E &amp; F, the monitor calls the modified load routine written in user RAM.
Consequently, use of the reset must be avoided immediately following the copy
as this would cause 0069 to be placed back in the scratchpad, and the normal
load routine would be executed.
</p>
<p>
This routine is suggested for systems where a poor rate of loading has been
experienced, our demonstration system has achieved a 100% success rate
following the use of this routine.
