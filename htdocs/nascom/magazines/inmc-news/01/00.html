<p>
This is the first real INMC Newsletter, at last. I&rsquo;m sorry it took so long to
get the ball rolling. This issue is mostly in the form of &ldquo;messages from our
Sponsor&rdquo; but we hope this will change and that you, the members, will contribute
the majority of the contents in future. We would like to hear from you if you
would like to
</p>
<ul class="dash indent">
<li> contribute a brief write up of an interesting application</li>
<li> place a small ad (free to INMC members)</li>
<li> start a local computer club</li>
<li> heap praise (or blame) on us</li>
<li> submit interesting circuits (e.g. for interfacing things)</li>
<li> submit useful programs</li>
<li> do anything else</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most programs will still be distributed in the usual way, but the smaller ones of
general interest will be published in the Newsletter.
</p>
<p>
Please also let me know if you have any comments about the Newsletter format. Is
it what you want? If so, tell us &ndash; it makes us feel wanted. If not, tell us so
we can change it &ndash; the INMC is for you, not us.
</p>
<p>
I would like your advice on one Particular point. It has been suggested that we
publish a list of INMC members to help you get in touch with each other locally.
This seems a good idea, but the list might then be used by anyone who gets hold
of it for mail shots. &lsquo;This could increase the number of unwanted advertising
material you get through the post. What do you think?
</p>
<p>
Having started, we hope to continue to to issue the Newsletter at approximately
six weekly intervals. I hope you like it.
