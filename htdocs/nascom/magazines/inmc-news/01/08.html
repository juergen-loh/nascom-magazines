<u>Kit Repairs</u>
</h3>
<p>
We have now instituted a flat &pound;25.00 fee for kit repairs, regardless of how
long it takes us to fix them. We have increased our staff and have reduced
our backlog to be able to give you a more responsive service. Many of our
distributors offer a similar service. Of course, if you find a faulty
component you can still return it to us within 90 days for replacement free
of charge. Please enclose proof of purchase (e.g. a receipt) otherwise we
will end up supplying free components to the whole world!
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, we have had one or two cases of faulty keyboards (not bad
considering the thousands we&rsquo;ve shipped). If you have a problem, please
don&rsquo;t modify it, return it to us for replacement or repair. If you attempt
to fix it you may invalidate the manufacturers guarantee.
