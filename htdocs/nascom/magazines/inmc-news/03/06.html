Dear Mr.Cockshott,
</p>
<p>
Congratulations on finding the hidden bonus in the Z80. It
is unfortunate that we can never be certain that every Z80
in the world has these instructions. Some might execute
them unreliably.
</p>
<p>
There are 8 more hidden instructions which are prefixed by
CB. These were found not to work as originally intended when
the Z80 was built, so they were simply written out of the
specification. See if you can find them and work out what they
do wrong! Also, there may be some ED prefix instructions that
have not yet been found. Good hunting.

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
I just had to write and congratulate you on
<a href="../../../02/00/text/#page">Issue&nbsp;2 of the INMC news</a>.
I enjoyed every page and every article and found
the tips most invaluable to a striving amateur like myself.
Your publication is a shining light in the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> wilderness.
Please! Please! keep it up.
</p>
<p>
P.S. When I have mastered the art sufficiently to contribute &ndash;
I will have a go!
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully
</p>
<p>

Dear Mr.Lincoln,
</p>
<p>
What can we say except thank you. We will not be able to
&ldquo;keep it up&rdquo; however, without some support from the vast
membership. The four of use who make up the INMC committee wrote the
<a href="../../../02/00/text/#page">last issue</a>
and
<a href="../../00/text/#page">this issue</a>
in their entirety and yet we all have full-time jobs. I am sure that it is not
beyond each member&rsquo;s scope to write just one short article
and send it to us. <u>If we can, then so can everyone else</u>.
We look forward to hearing from you when you have &ldquo;mastered
the art&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Yours sincerely
</p>
<p>
The Editor,
