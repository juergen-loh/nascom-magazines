(a) <u>HARD&shy;WARE</u>

<p>
Hardware expansion is made standard by the use of NASBUS.
This is a bus standard, and this means that the signals
between all different expansion boards will meet this
standard. Note that the new <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> computer plugs directly
into NASBUS, without the need for a buffer board, which is
an improvement. The <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> still has the same screen
formatting and the same Z80 CPU, so it is highly compatible
with <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;1</span>.

<p>
I hope that the
<a href="../../16/text/#article2">article on monitors</a>
(later in this newsletter)
explaining the development which has resulted in NAS-SYS, has
answered many questions. Here is a brief summary. The
following group of monitors are all highly compatible.
</p>
<?php boxStart("L"); ?>
<p>
<u>NASBUG T1</u>: This was replaced by T2, and no one has a NASBUG T1
any longer. (We hope!)
</p>
<p>
<u>NASBUG T2</u>: Standard 1K monitor.
</p>
<p>
<u>B-BUG</u>: 2K monitor, fully compatible with T2. It will run
all programs written for T2, without modification. It can read
and write tapes in LOAD/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>DUMP format, like T2, or in READ/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>WRITE
format. This monitor is not a <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> product.
</p>
<p>
<u>NASBUG T4</u>: 2K monitor, improved version of B-BUG. Same comments
apply as for B-BUG, One tiny difference &ndash; SRLOUT routine was
moved by one byte.

<u>NAS-SYS&nbsp;1</u> This new monitor is not directly compatible with
the earlier monitors. It is called NAS-SYS, meaning <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>
OPERATING SYSTEM, and has in fact been designed to provide for
easy upward compatibility in the future. Quite a few earlier
programs have been converted to NAS-SYS, (even including the
8K Basic!), and it has proved very easy in every case. When
NAS-SYS and its full documentation and listing are available,
I am sure it will be generally agreed that any inconvenience
is made worth while by the enormous improvements. If a user
has a large number of old programs, an old monitor can always
be plugged in to run them. In fact, even <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;2</span> could be run
under NASBUG T2, if you really want to do this! In the future,
all programs will be NAS-SYS compatible, and there won&rsquo;t be any
problems.

<h4 id="article3">
(c) <u class="uppercase">Soft&shy;ware &ndash; Tiny Basic From <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span></u>
</h4>
<p>
The 2K Tiny Basic runs under NASBUG T2, B-BUG or NASBUG T4.
If NASBUG T2 is in use, programs are saved on cassette using
LOAD/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>DUMP format. If B-BUG or T4 are plugged in, then the
Basic automatically uses READ/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>WRITE format, which is, of course,
