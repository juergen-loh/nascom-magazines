Two games had a &ldquo;Space&rdquo; theme. One was &ldquo;Space Invasion&rdquo;,
a game very similar to that seen in many amusement arcades.
Very entertaining, and a game that gets progressively more
difficult as you improve. We did manage to discover a way
of cheating, but we&rsquo;ll keep quiet on that one.
</p>
<p>
The other space game was &ldquo;Moon Lander.&rdquo; This game has
appeared many times on one computer or another, and we have
seen several versions written for the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>. This version,
however, we decided had a little extra and you will find a
full description of it, and machine code listing elsewhere
in this issue.
</p>
<p>
After each game we each awarded it points out of ten. At
the end of the evening we added them up. The totals clearly
indicated the winner as &ldquo;Moon Lander,&rdquo; entered by Nick Ray
but written by Arthur Norman and Chris Webster, with help
from Philip Gladstone, Jim Cownie and Nick Ray. To them we
will be sending a Zeap package. (We were thinking of sending
them 4K of Zeap each, and not telling them who has got which
bit!).
</p>
<p>
We also decided that, as Marcus Parker-Rhodes had got two
games in the final list, he should be awarded a prize also,
so a Super Tiny Basic set goes to him. Finally, to all
those listed below we will be sending a selection of programs
from the INMC library.
</p>
<p>
Thank you everybody for an entertaining evening.

<u>Games Competition Winner&nbsp;&ndash; Moon Lander</u>
</h4>
<p>
Reproduced below is the object code listing of the winner of
our games competition.
</p>
<p>
The aim of the game is to land a spacecraft on the moon&rsquo;s
surface with a vertical velocity of less than 30, as near to
the target (as indicated by the Distance parameter) as possible.
However, you must not land on a boulder.
