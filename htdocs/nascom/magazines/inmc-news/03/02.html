Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
There must be a number of <span class="uppercase">Nascom&nbsp;1</span> owners who, like myself
thought they were purchasing a kit for a complete and usable
micro system. This system offered the possibility of software
exchange via cassette.
</p>
<p>
Now I am reading in the
<a href="../../../#head">INMC News</a>
and elsewhere about <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span>
T1/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>T2,<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>T4, B-BUG, Tiny Basic, 3K Tiny Basic, Level A, Level B,
etc. No doubt <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> et al. are hoping to tempt owners such
as myself to expand our systems and run more sophisticated
programs.
</p>
<p>
From the <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> owner&rsquo;s angle this is most unsatisfactory.
There is a notable lack of information as to the interdependency
of the various developments, e.g. is 3K Basic compatible with
Nasbug T1? Does 3K Basic require 8K of memory? How compatible
are 2K &amp; 3K Basic? What comes after T4? What happened to
8K Basic?
</p>
<p>
The hobbyist needs to be able to be confident before he starts
expanding that

<dt>(iii)</dt><dd>His old software will still run.</dd>
<dt>(iv)</dt><dd>Software from other sources will run.</dd>
<dt>(v)</dt><dd>Further developments will not make his system obsolete.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The name of the game is &ldquo;information&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Can we have some?
</p>
<p>
Yours faithfully,
</p>

Dear, Mr.Griffiths,
</p>
<h4 class="uppercase">
<u>Upward Compatibility</u>
</h4>
<p>
The INMC promises to do its best to ensure that you have a
computer system which can be expanded and improved, without
hopeless incompatibility resulting.
