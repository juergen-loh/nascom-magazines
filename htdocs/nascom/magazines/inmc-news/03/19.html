<u>SOFT&shy;WARE LIBRARY</u>
</h1>
<p>
Below is a list of programs that are now available from the INMC
Software Library. Copies cost 8p per sheet, and the number of
sheets for each program is given alongside its description. Please
also enclose postage, as detailed on the enclosed order form.
</p>
<p>
For a variety of reasons, we have decided to remove the previous
list of 12 programs from the library, and for simplicity, this list
starts at number 20. Therefore, please do not write and ask us
about numbers 1 to 19, they don&rsquo;t exist.

					<u>Robots</u> <span>Approx 900 bytes</span>

					Six homicidal robots chasing you
					across a field of electrified pylons.
					The robots head directly towards you
					and so by careful movement you can
					persuade them to electrocute them
					selves on the pylons. Speed and
					difficulty selectable from cinch to
					impossible!
</p>
<p>
					Good instructions, teletype assembly
					listing, no comments.
