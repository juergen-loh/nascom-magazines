I must say that the immediate response to the second newsletter
was very encouraging and 99% of the people were enthusiastic.
The usual three people did not like it but I hope they will like
this one.
</p>
<p>
The Committee has so far only really produced the newsletters
but I hear rumour that they are about to generate some new ideas.
One small problem with the Committee is that in January, when it
was formed, its members were independent users but since that time
the majority of them have become Nascom employees. They are still
as critical but slightly more biased. Therefore, I ask again for
people to write in who are willing to be part of either the main
Committee under David Hunt&rsquo;s guidance as Chairman, or who would
help on a regional capacity as, for example, the INMC Officer in
their local computing club. Many clubs that I know of are now
getting a large number of Nascom users but none of them, as far
as I am aware, have an INMC Official.
</p>
<p>
Also, I do feel that, sceptical or not, more of you could have
made an effort to support Hunt and his cronies and sent in more
letters or ideas or programs or engineering tips. Trying to
produce a magazine without this kind of help from the outside
is bloody difficult and if you want to have an INMC then start
helping yourselves.
</p>
<p>
On a happier note, I was really pleased with the response to the
competition in which we got some incredible programs and you will
see the results and the winner&rsquo;s name in this issue. I am quite
prepared to put up prizes for competitions as long as people are
willing to enter them sensibly.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I would suggest that Nascom users when going to buy product
buy it from their local Distributor and support him, otherwise in
many areas you will not have a local Distributor at all. If you all
want to buy from one central warehouse, I feel that you will lose the
personal value that you all seem to feel is most important.
