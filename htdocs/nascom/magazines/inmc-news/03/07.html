<u>GAMES COMPETITION RESULTS.</u>
</h1>
<p>
Thank you for your competition entries. We didn&rsquo;t get the
quantity of response that we expected, but if we had I
imagine the judging would have taken a week!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, one evening recently the INMC committee sat down
with beer in one hand, sandwiches in the other and keyboard
between teeth to judge the games that we had received. The
programs had been entered, and stored on cassette during the
previous week by our noble secretary. She double checked for
errors and so we knew that any programs that didn&rsquo;t run were
either incorrect or illegible.
</p>
<p>
So the judging began with &ldquo;Burst the Balloon&rdquo;. In this game
balloons are released, one at a time, from the bottom of the
screen and make an erratic journey upwards, at the mercy of
random breezes. The aim of the game is to burst as many
balloons as possible by firing your gun, which is situated
on the left hand side of the screen. This is an infuriating
game as the balloons seem to tease you, pausing just below
your line of fire, and then leaping past it just as you shoot.
Quite entertaining, although we felt it could be improved by
allowing movement of the gun.
</p>
<p>
We then came to two versions of &ldquo;Life&rdquo;. Both interesting
although unfortunately not necessarily for the correct reasons.
We were a little uncertain whether or not to include these,
as &ldquo;Life&rdquo; is a simulation rather than a game. Anyway, we had
them on tape, so we tried them. The first one made clever use
of different ASCII characters to give an effective display of
30x48. Various standard patterns were tried, and bred
correctly. The speed of the program was impressive too. The
second version, however, was not quite as successful, for
whatever pattern we loaded seemed to make no difference and
just resulted in a varied pattern moving across the screen!
We could only assume that a transcription error had occurred
somewhere along the line.
</p>
<p>
We continued with various other games. These included &ldquo;Darts&rdquo;
which seemed to show promise, but also suffered from some bug;
&rdquo;Submarines&rdquo; which allowed you to drop depth charges from your
ship in a race against the clock to hit 9 submarines; and
&rdquo;Walled chase&rdquo; a game for two players, with one chasing the
other, but with invisible walls in the way.
</p>
<p>
&rdquo;Lollypop lady trainer&rdquo; appeared in the competition, and as
many of you will have discovered, this was our &ldquo;Mystery
Program&rdquo; in the last newsletter. From the same competitor
we had &ldquo;Road Race.&rdquo; This is a very entertaining game where
you have to steer along a narrowing road in a bid to get home.
There is a choice of three speeds, and the game ends with a
comment related to the amount of damage that you did to your
car. A must for learner drivers!
