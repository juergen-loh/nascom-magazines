four times faster. The 3K Basic is the 2K Basic with an extra
1K EPROM to provide extra commands, so it works exactly like
the 2K Basic. The 3K Basic, like the 2K Basic, requires some
memory expansion to run, either 8K, 16K or 32K.

(d) <u class="uppercase">Soft&shy;ware &ndash; Tiny Basic Level A And B</u>
</h4>
<p>
These Tiny Basic interpreters are not provided by <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>, and
no information about compatibility is available. We believe
that level A is a 2K Basic interpreter, which replaces the
monitor program, Therefore, no monitor is available when
level A is in use. Also, various features of the Tiny Basic
have had to be left out, including FOR &ndash; NEXT loops. The
only advantage is that no memory expansion is required to
use it. Obviously only very short programs can be run,
without memory expansion. Level B seems to be normal 2K
Tiny Basic. It is not known how programs are stored on tape,
or with which monitors it is compatible.

<h4>
(e) <u class="uppercase">Software &ndash; 8K BASIC</u>
</h4>
<p>
The 8K Basic is on its way. It has been well tested, and
really does exist and it works! It is coming from <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> in
two versions &ndash; in ROM at E000 &ndash; FFFF with workspace and
program starting at 1000, and also on tape, at 1000 &ndash; 2FFF,
with workspace and program starting at 3000. Apart from
the different location of the program area, these products
are virtually the same. Programs can be saved on tape.
Furthermore, <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> 8K Basic works with B-Bug, Nasbug T4
or NAS-SYS!!! (The tape version also works with Nasbug T1/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>T2).
Only when using NAS-SYS are full program editing facilities
available, making it very easy to change bits of programs
easily and quickly. We (the INMC committee) recommend that
you use every possible inducement to get your hands on NAS-SYS
and the 8K Basic, because we think it makes the whole system
far more useful, and very impressive even when compared to
certain boring machines which come ready built in plastic
boxes from the USA, at far greater cost.

<h4>
(f) <u class="uppercase">Soptware &ndash; ZEAP</u>
</h4>
<p>
The ZEAP Editor/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>Assembler runs under <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span> T2, or <span class="uppercase">Nasbug</span> T4.
It is going to be released in an improved form to run under
NAS-SYS.
</p>
<h4>
(g) <u class="uppercase">Soft&shy;ware &ndash; Z80 Programs From Other Sources</u>
</h4>
<p>
There are always problems when moving programs from one
system to another, because of different I/O capabilities and
different assignment of memory. However, the 2K and 8K Basic
interpreters have been converted for <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> without great
difficulty, and so have many other programs. NAS-SYS uses
standard ASCII codes, which will help make future conversions
easier. (Also, the 8K Basic will run most published Basic
programs, often without any modification.)
