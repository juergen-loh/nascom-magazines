May we all wish you a Happy Christmas, although by the time you
get this you&rsquo;ll all probably be unwrapping your Easter Eggs. We tried
to make this a bumper issue, but because of the close deadline, we
didn&rsquo;t quite make it, so we filled the mag. with programs (as usual).
As far as the programs go, we&rsquo;ve tried to include something for
everyone (except NAS-SYS&nbsp;1 machine code freaks, sorry about that, how
about some progs. for the library?), so there&rsquo;s N1 minimum system, and
N1 expanded system, Tiny Basic, Super Tiny Basic, and 8K Basic for N1
and N2.
</p>
<p>
In the
<a href="../../../04/19/text/#article1">last issue</a>
we anounced a Christmas Games competition,
but due to the prolonged illness of a key member of staff (come back
Bev) and printing delays, the mags didn&rsquo;t get posted till two days
before the closing date, so the competition is still open, and we&rsquo;ll
publish the winners in good time for next Christmas! Seriously though,
the closing date is 3 weeks after you get this issue. Also, because of
Bev&rsquo;s illness, the library has almost ground to a halt, so please bear
with us if you have had difficulty extracting programs. We aren&rsquo;t
saving your money for our next trip to the Bahamas.
</p>
<p>
Talking about the money: SUBS!!!!
</p>
<p>
In the early days, because it was all new, those who joined the
INMC got away with paying a pound registation fee, and haven&rsquo;t been
asked for anything since. More recent members have had to pay a fiver
for the privilege (plus the registration fee). Now we have decided that
all those who joined the INMC before the 31st January 1979 will have to
pay up before the 31st January 1980, and all those who joined after
January 1979 will be billed at the end of the month when their annual
subscriptions become due (or something).
</p>
<p>
We will allow 21 days for cheques to reach us, then if we
haven&rsquo;t seen the loot, names will be removed from the mailing list, and
it will cost an extra quid to re-register.
</p>
<p>
The mailing list (for those who joined before January 1979) for
<a href="../../../06/00/text/#page">issue&nbsp;6</a>
of this highly desirable rag will be made up from the list of
subscriptions received (so the print run will be cheap anyway), so if
you don&rsquo;t cough up, well sorry, but you won&rsquo;t ever find out who won the
Great Christmas Competition. And we&rsquo;ll all know who the meanies are
won&rsquo;t we.
</p>
<p>
So the message is &lsquo;cheque books to the fore&rsquo; folks and send a
fiver, payable to:
</p>
<p class="noindent">
INMC<br>
c/o Nascom Microcomputers,<br>
__, _____ ______,<br>
Chesham,<br>
Bucks.
</p>
<p class="noindent">
If you live in France special arrangements will be made for you to pay
the money to the French Distibutor, so we will be letting you know what
to do.
