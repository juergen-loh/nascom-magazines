IT&rsquo;S NOT EASY
</h2>
<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Many thanks for the Newsletter and Library. I have just purchased
and built a Nascom&nbsp;1 with B. Bug, and managed to get it going.
</p>
<p>
Now, here is a point for you:- After reading the construction
book, which is easy to understand, I build the machine, so far so
good. Now read the program Manual, and what do we find, a book
written by people who know what they are talking about, but I am
afraid it does not mean a thing to me. After about 3 days of
trying we manage to get the simple programs contained going, but
not a clue as to what keys to press or whatever. (It seems to me
that you are supposed to know things like that). So the next
thing we do we join the INMC and get the newsletter, to try and
find out some of these things. What do we find, a snow plough
circuit, great build it, it works, great, put the mystery program
in, great it works! What next? Read the rest of the newsletter
great, now all we&rsquo;ve got is a whole load of questions, like, what&rsquo;s
a T2 or a T4 or a ZEAP etc., etc.
</p>
<p>
Now don&rsquo;t think I am getting at just the newsletter writers, they
know what they mean, but people like me are only just beginning
to &ldquo;play&rdquo; with Nascom and just don&rsquo;t know what things like the
above are.
</p>
<p>
Don&rsquo;t forget we just go and buy a Nascom off the shelf from somewhere
or other and all you get are the two books with it, and one
of these just is not in &ldquo;non-computer&rdquo; mans words.
</p>
<p>
Hope you can see what I mean, I don&rsquo;t usually moan like this,
you&rsquo;re doing a good job, but <u>please</u> oh <u>please</u> lets have as much
paperwork as you like, on T4 etc., and add ons etc., and newsletters
or program manuals that the man in the street can understand,
or at least tell him to press this and that and so and so
will happen.
</p>
<p>
It will really help a lot, and perhaps stop some of us going
hairless,
</p>
<p>

We are trying our best to give you all the information we have.
The problem is that Mr Hewitt is an expert in electronics, but a
beginner at software. The best suggestion we have is that he
takes the &ldquo;Mystery Program&rdquo; which he has working, and writes out
the hexadecimal codes, converting them to source code and then
work out how it works! I know it isn&rsquo;t easy, but once you have
