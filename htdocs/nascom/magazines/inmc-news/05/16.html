XTAL BASIC UPDATE 1.3 &ndash; SEPTEMBER 1979
</h1>
<p>
We have received the following release from Crystal, and reproduce
it here for your information.
</p>
<p>
The following &lsquo;bugs&rsquo; are the only ones so far found in XTAL BASIC:&ndash;
</p>
<p>
1. In all copies up to and including serial no 55.<br>
Caused errors in the use of scientific notation.<br>
CORRECTION: -<br>
&gt;M2744 &nbsp; DM274E<br>
A6 &gt; A9 &nbsp; A5 &gt; AS
</p>
<p>
2. In copies up to serial no 66.<br>
&lsquo;WAIT&rsquo; command does not work properly<br>
CORRECTION<br>
&gt;M2267 &nbsp; &gt;M226F<br>
0A &gt; 08 &nbsp; C1 &gt; 5F C1 F1 47
</p>
<p>
3. In copies up to serial no 88<br>
BASIC &lsquo;hangs&rsquo; sometimes when a string space overflow occurs<br>
CORRECTION<br>
&gt;M20C0<br>
02 &gt; 00
</p>
<p>
4 In copies up to serial no 106.<br>
Caused characters within quotes of ASCII value greater than
80H to appear as reserved words under &lsquo;EDIT&rsquo; but OK under &lsquo;LIST&rsquo;<br>
CORRECTION<br>
&gt;M2B1B<br>
F4 &gt; F6
</p>
<p>
5. In copies up to serial no 150.<br>
Programs longer than about 5K found to contain corrupted
lines deep within the program.<br>
CORRECTION<br>
&gt;M13E8 &nbsp; &gt;M1519<br>
AF &gt; CD 19 15 &nbsp; 00 &gt; AF BE 23 20 FC C9
</p>
<p>
6. In copies up to serial no 165.<br>
The numbers used in the CLEAR command cannot exceed 32767.
This could cause problems if it is required to use small
machine-code programs at the top of the memory space in
systems with 32K or more RAM.<br>
CORRECTION<br>
&gt;M1813 &nbsp; &gt; M1827 &nbsp; ?&gt;M12B4<br>
C7 &gt; B1 12 &nbsp; C7 &gt; B1 12 &nbsp; 00 &gt; CD 7F 1B C3 D0 1<br>
Now, to set TOPRAM to say, 8400H in a 32K system, you would
type:<br>
CLEAR 50, &ndash;31744 &nbsp; i.e, use negative numbers for locations
greater than 7FFFH, as in the CALL and POKE commands.
</p>
<p>
7. Again up to serial no 165.<br>
Some users have expressed a preference to restrict the number
of keys that interrupt a BASIC program. This modification
will allow the program to stop if &lsquo;BS&rsquo; is typed, and then any
key will continue. If &lsquo;shift BS&rsquo; is typed, either when
running or when halted, the program will BREAK, as if a STOP
command had been encountered.<br>
&gt;M168A &nbsp; &gt;M16F9<br>
52 &gt; F8 16 18 02 &nbsp; 52 &gt; 4D 0C FE 1D CC 3E 00 FE 1E 00 00 00 00.<br>
All should now be well! Just save XTAL BASIC on another tape.
