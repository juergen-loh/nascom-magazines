We have received one letter that complains that all we talk about
are Nascom products! Well this is true, as we can only speak about
what we have got.
</p>
<p>
Please remember, we are a bunch of private individuals, whose
pockets only stretch so far (and not as far as that if our wives
are to be believed). So we can hardly talk about the latest
&lsquo;Um Yukee&rsquo; from Fred Bloggs &amp; Co unless we buy one. We get a fair
amount of co-operation from Nascom in terms of advance information
about new products, but unless the independent manufacturers submit
samples of products to Nascom (where we can lay our hands on them)
or to ourselves, we are hardly in a position to review them. So
our admitted ignorance of, say, the CC SOFT Basic is because none
of us has a copy.
</p>
<p>
If you would like reviews of other products please write them.
We will print them provided they are objective.

we had a look at the Bits and P.C.s graphics, this issue
there is a review of the Comp S100 board. If you have any other
non-Nascom add on, please send us your report&nbsp;&ndash; or a few free samples!!

<u>STOP PRESS</u> Comp S100 board did not meet printing deadline&nbsp;&ndash; see

Dear Sirs,
</p>
<p>
John Waddell, author of &ldquo;Burst-the-Balloon&rdquo; has written to me and
pointed out an error in my &ldquo;Road-Race&rdquo; listing in the INMC library.
</p>
<p>
At 0CDE, I have written BO where I should have put OB! I&rsquo;m very
sorry for the inconvenience, but I hope you can change this, before
sending out more copies?
</p>
<p>
May Babbage be with you,<br>
Marcus Parker-Rhodes<br>
