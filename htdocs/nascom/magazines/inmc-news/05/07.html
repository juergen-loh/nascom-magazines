finished, you will understand how to write your own programs.
Also, get programs from the INMC library, and don&rsquo;t just put
them in and run them, but read them carefully until you understand
them.

<u>THEY DON&rsquo;T WORK&nbsp;&ndash; OR DO THEY?</u>

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
After many hours of soldering,<br>
Building up my Nascom one,<br>
I waited for your newsletter,<br>
Hoping for programs to run.<br>
Eventually the postman called<br>
With a letter just for me,<br>
And I really was delighted,<br>
With Mastermind and a mystery.<br>
There I sat at the keyboard,<br>
All day and half the night,<br>
But mastermind prints <span class="uppercase">Marking Error</span>,<br>
And the lolly lady moves at the speed of light.
</p>
<p>
Well I wonder where the fault lies,<br>
Is it you or is it me,<br>
After which I reconsider&nbsp;&ndash;<br>
There can&rsquo;t be bugs at the INMC.<br>
So, I&rsquo;ve put my pen to paper,<br>
With a cry for help, to you,<br>
Hoping you can solve my problem<br>
Before I burn out my VDU.
</p>
<p>
Yours hopefully,<br>
R A E Milton<br>

We received a couple of letters saying that the programs don&rsquo;t
work, but we received lots of letters saying that they do! We
can only suggest that Mr Milton check his programs again. Also
as explained in &ldquo;Little known facts&rdquo; in
<a href="../../../04/09/text/#article2">Issue&nbsp;4</a>,
the L command can be a great help in entering long programs by hand.
</p>
<p>
If you have still not got the free programs running, then we
suggest you read the letter below. All you need then do is tabulate
the non-working program, compare the checksums that are
now displayed against the listing, then correct any errors,
Simple, isn&rsquo;t it!

Dear Sir,
</p>
<p>
Here is a little program to cause the &lsquo;T&rsquo; command to print out the
check sum, for use with Nasbug monitors.
</p>
<p>
It is written in position independant code so to run it, first
load it into a convenient part of the memory then execute at the
first memory address.
