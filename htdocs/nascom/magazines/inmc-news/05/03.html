the answers then we will reply, or if of general interest, publish; or
if we don&rsquo;t we will pass the letter on to someone who may. Either way,
to DEMAND replies to technical questions is not really on.
</p>
<p>
I would like to thank those on the committee, Kerr, Paul,
Richard, and Howard (who resigned recently) for their support over the
last year. To Derek for taking on the mammoth task of re-assembling the
complete library (he recently sent us a bill for 10 typewriter
ribbons). To all the girls at Nascom who type the mags, control the
circulation and mailing lists, and Bev in particular who keeps the
library in some semblance of order. And to all those members who have
written articles for us. Finally to welcome Derek (the same one) and
Eddie to the committee.
</p>
<p>
Who knows what the future will hold, one thing is pretty
certain, <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> RULES OK, and with any sort of luck the INMC will go
from strength to strength.

ABOUT THE INMC
</h1>
<p>
For the new members here is a brief explanation of what the INMC
is and how it works.
</p>
<p>
The INMC is run by a committee, the members of which live in or
around London. The President of the committee is Kerr Borland,
Nascom&rsquo;s infamous Sales Director; the Chairman is David Hunt, and
the other members are Richard Beal, Derek Brough, Paul Greenhalgh
and Eddie Pounce.
</p>
<p>
The committee meets every couple of weeks at each others homes,
although any single meeting is generally a small subset of the
whole&nbsp;&ndash; i.e. two or three! At these meetings various letters and
articles are considered for inclusion in the newsletter, and
other articles are written. Up to date most of the content of the
newsletter has been generated by the committee but our pleas for
material are being heard (by a few) and it is members articles
that we want to print.
</p>
<p>
We also like to hear of any technical queries, either hardware
or software, and if of general interest we will print them with a
reply. We cannot, however, guarantee a personal reply as we do
all have full time jobs, houses, cars, computers and in some cases
even wives to keep us busy.
</p>
<p>
The final job of the committee is to sift through the programs
that we receive and consider them for the software library.
(Please note that the existing library is for Nasbug and B-Bug
only, although we do hope to include Nas-Sys programs shortly).
These programs are then available for a photocopying charge, to
the INMC members.
</p>
<p>
This brings us on to the secretariat&nbsp;&ndash; viz Beverly. Bev deals
with all memberships, requests for programs, magazine subscriptions
etc. Unfortunately Bev has been off ill for several weeks and will
not be back for some time yet. However, good fortune is with us,
Val has kindly stepped in to help clear the backlog. So please
bear with us while we get things straight, but don&rsquo;t let any upset
stop you sending in those articles!
