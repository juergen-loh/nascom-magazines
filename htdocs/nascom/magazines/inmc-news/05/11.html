This is also the case if you don&rsquo;t want the results where I have
put them.

Calling 0400 reads both joysticks, to read only one, call either
0407 or 0415, depending on which socket the joystick is plugged
into. The format of the results is;
</p>
<table class="indent">
<tr><td>0C50</td><td>Trigger A</td><td>00 normal, FF if trigger pressed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0C51/2</td><td>Pot A/1, A/2</td><td>One byte for each pot in the joystick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0C53</td><td>Trigger B</td><td>00 normal, FF if trigger pressed,</td></tr>
<tr><td>0C54/5</td><td>Pot B/1, B/2</td><td>One for each pot of other joystick.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0C56</td><td class="uppercase">Range Setting</td><td>The value set in this byte controls the</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=3>range of the results. For example, if 10 is used, each pot returns
a number between 01 and 48, approximately. The smaller the number
0C56 is, the larger the range of the results becomes.</td></tr>

&ldquo;<u>What else is there in this Darkbug</u>&rdquo;

<p>
Quite a lot, is the answer to that question, but a lot of it relates
to the graphics board I mentioned in my earlier effort. There&rsquo;s
the spiral screen wipe, for instance; or the automatic graph
plotting routine. Pretty boring, really, isn&rsquo;t it? NO? In that
case, here is one I use a lot, in games, and in &ldquo;wall-paper&rdquo;
programs. It is relocatable, it is called SWAP, and it has the
effect of replacing all of a given character on the screen with
another. Just put the character you wish to remove in B and its
replacement in C, the call this subroutine:

Those of you with sharp eyes will have spotted that I have used
something from
<a href="../../../02/04/text/#article1">INMC News No 2</a>,
without which the routine would
have been a lot longer, to compare HL and DE. Finding that proved
the value of the club to me, and I only hope this lot does as
much for your programs as that did for mine!
