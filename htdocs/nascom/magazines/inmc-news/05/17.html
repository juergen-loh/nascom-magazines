<u>Review Of Editor / Assembler Packages For <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> Computers</u>
</h1>
<p>
Here is a chart showing a detailed comparison of all the Editor /
	Assemblers available for the Nascom. All three are capable
of editing and assembling a program correctly, and they are all
	good and quite easy to use. ZEAP is available in two versions,
ZEAP&nbsp;1.1 for the old <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span> monitors, T2 and T4, and the considerably
	improved ZEAP&nbsp;2.0 which uses NAS-SYS. ZEN and V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T Packages
are only available for T2/<?php spChar("zwsp"); ?>T4, but it is very likely that they will
	soon be modified to run under NAS-SYS as well. The ZEAP&nbsp;2.0
tested was a pre-release version and there may well be modifications
	made before production commences, Our thanks to <span class="uppercase">Nascom</span>, V&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T
Electronics, and Newbear for allowing us to sample the delights of
	the programs. We are not going to recommend that any one is best,
because if depends on exactly what you want to do with it, and also
	on how much you can afford to spend. Here then is the detailed
chart.
