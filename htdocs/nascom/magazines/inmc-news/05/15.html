Having had my moans, Nascom are to be congratulated,
Nascom&nbsp;2 is a superb machine, and another satisfied customer bites the
dust.

The video fault mentioned above seems to be fairly common, and
really comes back to the oscillator. The output of the 74S04 (IC56)
seems to be almost sinusoidal in shape, and this makes the first
divider (IC49) a bit unhappy. IC49, in turn feeds IC7la which generates
the LD signal for IC65, and any jitteriness of IC49 is transferred to
IC65. The best cure is the 100pF capacitor as mentioned above, but a
5pF capacitor between pins 12 and 7 of IC56 helps to square up. the
clock a little. Severe clock jitter can cause some very weird timing
problems giving rise to overall unreliability.

The memory supplied with N2&rsquo;s at present is our old friend
Nascom Series 1 Memory card, which was the subject of a note about
&lsquo;Memory Plague&rsquo; in an earlier news letter. Well as an N2 may well ask
it to run at 4&nbsp;MHz without any wait states, a little more investigation
was considered desirable. The buss signals from an N2 are a lot
cleaner than an N1 which helps, but &lsquo;Plague&rsquo; still raises its head from
time to time. First, check that you have used the 74157s in the memory
not the 74LS157s. Both types are used on an N2, and are easily mixed
up. Secondly, gridding the +5&nbsp;volt and ground rails is a good idea,
there is a sheet in the N2 kit about that. Thirdly, change all the 33R
resistors to 68R, and change the links between P8 and P9, P12 and P13
for 68R as well.

These mods alone cured a board that suffered from severe
&lsquo;Plague&rsquo; at 2&nbsp;MHz on an N1. All the other mods (the Rs and Cs from the
earlier note, etc), were removed. The board worked perfectly at 2 or 4
MHz on both an unmodified &lsquo;B&rsquo; issue N1 (worst case) and an N2. So it
seems that proper gridding of the board, and curing any tendency for
the address and control lines of the <?php externalLink("4116","",""); ?>s to under-shoot (the 68R
resistors) will cure &lsquo;Plague&rsquo; on its own.
