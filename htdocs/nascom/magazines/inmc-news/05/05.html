So having got the sordid business over&hellip;

<p>
<span class="uppercase">Welcome All Nascom&nbsp;2 Owners</span>. We&rsquo;re afraid that there isn&rsquo;t much in this
edition (except &lsquo;ELIZA&rsquo;) to interest you, but we won&rsquo;t forget you just
because Nascom haven&rsquo;t given us our free issue N2&rsquo;s yet nudge, nudge
(some chance!). We&rsquo;ll be publishing bits about N2&rsquo;s as they come along,
and about 10 8K Basic progs will be in the library by the time you see
this. Just in case you haven&rsquo;t already guessed, this is your magazine,
and all contributions are gratefully received, if not necessarily
printed. So keep it all coming.
</p>
<p>
Just in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, parts of last months news
letter, and bits of this have been prepared using the new Naspen text
processor, then typed using a secondhand IBM terminal, it&rsquo;s not bad is
it? Also, just in case you hadn&rsquo;t noticed, there is more than one
Editor, that&rsquo;s why this rag suffers from a plethera of different
styles. It is our plan to issue Naspen to all those concerned, that way
all we need do is collect all the tapes together, then type them all on
the IBM at one time.

Well this is the end of another late night editorial session.
Time for bed, and dreams of the new super &lsquo;Inter-Galactic Bar
Billiards&rsquo; program, using real planets as balls (now I bet that will be
an exhilarating experience for someone) and to wish all our readers
Good Night, I mean Happy Christmas, and Happy Computing.
</p>
<p>
From us on the INMC Committee.

The Merseyside Nascom Users Group, some 150 strong, has put together a
64 page, A4 book entitled &ldquo;Nascom Programs and Information&rdquo;. The main
part of the book is dedicated to the programs, some 15 in all including:
</p>
<p class="indent">
3D noughts and crosses &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Othello &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Income Tax<br>
Screenwriter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pico Pilot &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crash Landing
</p>
<p>
Plus the complete listing for a 2K Tiny Basic.
</p>
<p>
The INMC is able to offer these to its members for &pound;2-75 including postage
and packing. <u>Please note</u> that the programs in this book are for use with
Nasbug T1, T2, T4 and B-Bug but <u>not Nas-Sys</u>. For use with Nas-Sys the
various monitor calls require changing, and other patching (e.g. changing
all codes to ASCII) may be required.
