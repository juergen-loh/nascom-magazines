CHAIRMAN&rsquo;S PAGE

It is now almost a year since I took on the task of Chairman of
the IMNC and during that time I have watched the INMC grow. The
membership is impressive by almost any standards and stands now at
about 2000. The members are from all walks of life, from accountants to
hospital porters, from bus drivers to professional computer engineers.
It is encouraging to see the spirit that exists between the members of
the INMC.
</p>
<p>
There is almost a latent sense of conspiracy to try to catch
Nascom out, be it with bits of hardware design, software, or whatever;
none the less, this spirit also expresses an intense loyalty to what is
after all a very good product. (No Nascom don&rsquo;t pay me).
</p>
<p>
I was playing with a shortwave set recently, and overheard a
conversation between two CB&rsquo;ers on 27 MHz. One, calling himself the
&lsquo;Prowler&rsquo; was vigorously defending his Nascom&nbsp;1 against the various
merits of a product that hails from the nether depths of Barnet.
Nascoms are now on the legitimate SW bands churning out and decoding
morse code (one program is going into the library), and there is a
distinct group of licensed radio amateurs who use Nascoms for RTTY and
God Knows what!
</p>
<p>
I have seen a Nascom being used as a &lsquo;patient monitor&rsquo; in a
hospital intensive care unit where the patient&rsquo;s heart beat and
respiration is continuously checked, and it also keeps a log of drugs
dispensed. In all, Nascoms are turning up in the most unlikely places.
</p>
<p>
Another sign that Nascom is here to stay, is that external
manufacturers are now making a range of Nascom products available,
both software and hardware; ranging from word processors, and maths
packages to relay switched output boards and EPROM programmers etc.
Nascom continue to support their own product of course, although
personally, I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t shout about new products until they
are available. As a dealer, I get a lot of aggro on that score,

<p>
To the newsletter, I hope you think that the quality has
improved over the past year, and now that subs are becoming due, that
you feel you have had good value for money. At first we virtually had
to write every word, and in the process almost exhausted everything we
had to say; but our appeals for material from members is beginning to
bear fruit, and more and more &lsquo;external products&rsquo; are appearing in the
mag. Speaking on behalf of the committee, we would like to make the
mags more frequent, but pressure of work (yes we do put in the odd
day&rsquo;s work occasionally) doesn&rsquo;t really allow this. Splinter groups of
the INMC are now getting organised, and local newsletters may be a
thing of the future. The Merseyside group have published a superb
Nascom program book, and we look forward to the next.
</p>
<p>
Now for a moan: we occasionally get letters demanding (and I do
mean demanding) solutions to technical problems, now I must emphasize
that INMC does not exist to solve all technical problems. If we know
